US,_inKs4eeHiI,kung fu panda 4  official trailer,universal pictures,2023-12-13T15:43:38Z,,4120394,275123,"kung fu panda 4  in theaters march 8

this spring for the first time in almost a decade comedy icon jack black returns to his role as po the worlds most unlikely kung fu master with a hilarious buttkicking new chapter in dreamworks animations beloved actioncomedy franchise kung fu panda 4 

after three deathdefying adventures defeating worldclass villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills po the dragon warrior golden globe nominee jack black is called upon by destiny to  give it a rest already more specifically hes tapped to become the spiritual leader of the valley of peace

that poses a couple of obvious problems first po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet and second he needs to quickly find and train a new dragon warrior before he can assume his new lofty position 

even worse theres been a recent sighting of a wicked powerful sorceress chameleon oscar winner viola davis a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature large or small and chameleon has her greedy beady little eyes on pos staff of wisdom which would give her the power to resummon all the master villains whom po has vanquished to the spirit realm 

so pos going to need some help he finds it kinda in the form of crafty quickwitted thief zhen golden globe winner awkwafina a corsac fox who really gets under pos fur but whose skills will prove invaluable in their quest to protect the valley of peace from chameleons reptilian claws this comedic oddcouple duo will have to work together in the process po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places 

the film features the voice talent of returning stars academy award winner dustin hoffman as kung fu master shifu james hong everything everywhere all at once as pos adoptive father mr ping academy award nominee bryan cranston as pos birth father li and emmy award nominee ian mcshane as tai lung shifus former student and archnemesis oscar winner ke huy quan everything everywhere all at once joins the ensemble as a new character han the leader of the den of thieves

lyrics 
becky g
si se supone que ya te olvide 
que lo de nosotros ya descansa en paz
dime que hago aqui en mi soledad 
pensando en como estas 

leonardo aguilar
dime si hay otra boca que te besa
si todava sigo en tu cabeza 
quiero saber si con otro tattoo 
te tapastes mi nombre 
con otro nombre

becky g
yo por el contrario casi perdi el alma
pa no sentir tu adis que me desarma  
trate de negociarlo con el karma 
y me dijo todo se paga 
todo se paga

ngela aguilar
yo por el contrario casi vendo el alma 
a cambio de vivir sin sentir nada 
y se que se me nota en la mirada  
que tus recuerdos maltratan 
pero aun no me mata 

becky g
quise hablar con el karma y pedirle que me dejara 
olvidar su cara 
que me perdonar
porque siento que apuntas pero no disparas
le grito a dios por qu me desamparas 

ngela aguilar
aveces miento 
pa ver si siento 
que puedo respirar sin ti

leonardo aguilar
pero tu sabes que no es as
tu si estas bien sin mi 

ngela aguilar
yo por el contrario casi pierdo el alma 
por no sentir tu adis que me desarma 
trate de negociarlo con el karma 
me dijo todo se paga 
todo se paga

becky g
yo por el contrario casi vendo el alma 
a cambio de vivir sin sentir nada 
y se que se me nota en la mirada 
que tu recuerdos maltratan 
pero aun no me mata

this looks incredible when we say we want the visuals this is what we mean 
i havent gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years  this can only be seen properly in theatre
denis villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed also the fact that theyve built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love denis and the team have for the process
this film stands as the cinematic masterpiece weve been yearning for elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights its impact on the scifi genre is unprecedented setting a new benchmark for future endeavors
but i do see a way there is a narrow way through i absolutely love the way he said that line im so excited for this movie
this film is the cinematic brilliance weve been waiting for for decades it really takes movie making to another level i really dont think there is any scifi series like this one is showing up to be
by far one of the finest movie trailer in recent years the build up is just so powerful and aweinspiring especially with the gorgeous music denis seems to have outdone himself with this one this is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope it is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years he is also the new master of intelligent and profound sciencefiction films i mean arrival blade runner 2049 dune part one dune part 2 and most probably following next will be rendezvous with rama and dune messiah an amazingly talented artist
that silence gave me serious chills i had to watch it again cant wait to see the actual scene 
this is not a movie this is pure art
how the heck does denis villeneuve deliver yet another classic that works so ridiculously well this day and age incredible i am just hoping he does more projects similar to this taking an oldie and bringing it to the modern audience
im a huge fan of the dune universe and i absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books theres also a game in development called dune awakening so i love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 
this movie franchise is a work of art love the books love everything about part i part ii is a must see
princess irulan looks like a prisoner of fate you can tell the team behind this is on the next level when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a characters costume embodies their story
yessssss    throughout the trailer i had goosebumps bigger than i have ever had clean to the end and even after   i dont think i have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does
since the first dune movie ive been obsessed best stuff that has come out of hollywood in years villeneuve and hans zimmer go hand in hand here cause it was the first time i came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score my spotify top 5 of 23 is all dune  hats off and i really look forward to dune 2 not less than how i looked forward to the return of the king 20 years ago
absolutely blown away by this trailer the visuals storyline and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters cant wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen
major goosebumps everything about this looks incredible i loved part 1 and im all in for part 2  i just wish i could watch it now
the cinematic event ive been waiting for dune will win best director editor cinematographer music costume and vfx if it doesnt then i dont know what should this is a pure labour of love i would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does cannot wait
denis villeneuve is an absolute master  ive loved all of his movies this will be incredible just like part 1 was",1,Film & Animation,11300000,PT2M40S,"['let honest denis villeneuve the music the trailer just epic one the best trailer have seen year', 'this look incredible when say want the visuals this what mean', 'have not_ gotten actual goosebump body because film year this can only seen properly theatre', 'denis villeneuve deserves lot respect for being brave enough take such project considering how many dune movie failed also the fact that they have built everything especially the era green screen movie show how much love denis and the team have for the process', 'this film stand the cinematic masterpiece have been yearning for elevating storytelling unprecedented height impact the scifi genre unprecedented setting new benchmark for future endeavor', 'but see way there narrow way through absolutely love the way said that line excited for this movie', 'this film the cinematic brilliance have been waiting for for decade really take movie making another level really not_ think there any scifi series like this one showing', 'far one the finest movie trailer recent year the build just powerful and aweinspiring especially with the gorgeous music denis seems have outdone himself with this one this going incredible movie experience filled with emotion and hope amazing that director can make such quality motion picture one after the other and releasing almost one every two year also the new master intelligent and profound sciencefiction film mean arrival blade runner 2049 dune part one dune part and most probably following next will rendezvous with rama and dune messiah amazingly talented artist', 'that silence gave serious chill had watch again cannot wait see the actual scene', 'this not_ movie this pure art', 'how the heck doe denis villeneuve deliver yet another classic that work ridiculously well this day and age incredible just hoping doe more project similar this taking oldie and bringing the modern audience', 'huge fan the dune universe and absolutely love the atmospheric translation these movie from the book there also game development called dune awakening love how are finally giving this universe the attention deserves', 'this movie franchise work art love the book love everything about part part must see', 'princess irulan look like prisoner fate you can tell the team behind this the next level when they think everything through thoroughly that even character costume embodies their story', 'yes throughout the trailer had goosebump bigger than have ever had clean the end and even after not_ think have ever seen movie trailer that the edge emotional seat like this one doe', 'since the first dune movie have been obsessed best stuff that come out hollywood year villeneuve and han zimmer hand hand here because the first time came out cinema absolute awe the score spotify top all dune hat off and really look forward dune not_ than how looked forward the return the king year ago', 'absolutely blown away this trailer the visuals storyline and suspense have eagerly counting down the day until this movie hit theater cannot wait experience this epic adventure the big screen', 'major goosebump everything about this look incredible loved part and all for part just wish could watch now', 'the cinematic event have been waiting for dune will win best director editor cinematographer music costume and vfx doe not_ then not_ know what should this pure labour love would like thank favourite director all time for inspiring with everything doe cannot wait', 'denis villeneuve absolute master have loved all his movie this will incredible just like part']",160

tearsofthekingdom legendofzelda somethingseries parody nintendoswitch zelda nintendo animation terminalmontage",5968,"link does another speed run and ganondorf dancing his another suave dance

lol nice animation
loved seeing nabiu with a doortal at 533 cant wait for the pilot
510 all things considered ganon using his own health bar as a weapon is metal asf
rauru it would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi 

link wing shield jumps disrespectfully
the five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
i love the ending where it seems that link is going to save zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until link realizes that the speedrun is over
i dont know what zelda told rauru about linkbut he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
i appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and i appreciate that you gave it some meaning and the ganondorf fight was next level
i already knew he couldnt get wrecked like the other endbosses because of suavemente but i never would have expected that his weakness was no suavemente 
also i laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon
in all its accurate to the source material and continue what you do best
the fact that ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and i love it 
the life ending neck cracks throughout the terminal montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
when ganon started  dancing suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears love the details 
merry christmas  jeremy big hugs to you and the team i love your work 
all the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing ive been waiting for this one for a while
gotta love how link doesnt even bother trying to save zelda the first time then doesnt even visibly question or react beyond the mandated qte to the fact that shes suddenly appeared out of nowhere in freefall and still leaves her to take a dunk in the lake 
425 this is my favorite moment you can feel links determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
a rush of dopamine always hits hard every time i enjoy the chaos of another video 

also i love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol
421 i cant imagine how terrified that bokoblin mustve been he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing hyah sounds and then link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
your animations will never get old
325 as much as i find the gloom hands to be terrifying i would imagine it would be cool if ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack lookout landing it wouldnt add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like ganondorf was more of a threat
447 is seriously the coolest attack animation youve ever done

kratos is not just the god of warbut he is nowthe god of hope
kratos the spartan the god of war and most importantly the father of boy is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts
theres something eerie about seeing a younger kratos in this modern light ive grown to love the older kratos but at the same time you are terrified of the younger kratos
the god of war becomes the god of hope i think we can all agree that kratos deserved this ending more than anything
everyones talking about young kratos and rightfully so but can we give a round of applause for tyr the fact we got to fight him not once but four times was amazing and that last encounter pure awesome
that young kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look they did great job in representing young wild kratos who still doesnt seem to understand what was going on with him at that point
if old kratos hates himself from the past you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed what an absolute legend
seeing tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more he truly has traveled a lot
kratos really came full circle he became the god of hope when all else was lost he still found hope to move on im happy to see he never forgotten pandoras words
the size difference and the different vibes young kratos and old kratos have is amazing specially when young kratos moved from his pose it was so menacing
im not gonna lie i almost teared up watching this ending

mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational

definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way
looking at this scene i cant help but think how many times i have wanted to do the exact same thing kratos did staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young selfish stupid cruel and nothing more than a lowly piece of work but then realize how far i have come in my years i needed this more than anyone could realize kratos your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that i was in tears your story one of death destruction and chaos but also of love redemption and hope you bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question who am i we are who we choose to be both of our past and of our present
love how kratos finally confronts all his regrets and it hits hard

this is honestly christopher judges best performance i have ever seen the emotions the anger the hate and then the sadness to pure realisation in his voice honestly made me teary inside
this was such an emotional journey thank you so much to santa monica studio for this beautiful gift theyre amazing for this who agrees with me seeing young kratos meet with redeemed kratos facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light this hits home for me because i suffer with mental health disorders and seeing kratos face his younger self will be me when i recover
kratos confronting his younger self
in my head i picture that hes gaining closure with his bloodthirsty past and telling him that this is what he needed to become the god of hope the father of boy the god of redemption

suggestion the wolf armor could be colored with dyes like the leather pieces
i sincerely hope they make it so you can dye the wolf armour later on or maybe trim it or something
excited for the last big 121 announced feature so far in the armadillo and wolf armour very curious what will be coming in the rest of the update now 
the armadillo and wolf armour look great ingame didnt expect to see it done so soon
can it be enchanted can we dye it i hope they keep developing it so its a viable item to get for our dogs
suggestion can it be enchanted protection iv on wolf armour would be awesome
trust us to introduce a cuddly new mob and give it the yuckiest food imaginable 
fireflies
wolf armor and the armadillo are better than expected
suggestion can we enchant the armor like with thorns or even protection just to get the most out of it
finally a use for spider eyes other than brewing i wish they ate rotten flesh as well but i can just give those to the wolves
it would be cool to be able to upgrade it with a smithing table maybe even add trims being able to dye the armour is also something i see all over the comments ofc
aw sad to see the eye placement from the concept art not carry over it so much more accurate to what actual armadillos look like and would have looked so much cuterless goofy than the current iteration
we all thought it was gonna be like one defense but daimond armor for wolfs is sick

finally its good to see they added some actual drift physics not the most realistic by all means but its hell of a lot of fun kind of wish it was available for more cars though but this was a great little update 
yusuf amir is so lucky this is the first gta online video that has less dislikes and the community is less pissed 
i love this so far the game feels fun again and more alive even just adding the animals has made things so much better i love the new cars and im playing the missions rn thanks rockstar banger after banger
can we all appreciate how long rockstar has kept gta 5 alive its awesome to see a game from my childhood still relevant all these years later
amir is one of my favorite side characters it the series and its so good seeing him back
its crazy that even as adults these trailers still make us feel like kids again
for me one of the best updates so far thanks rockstar thats what we want
its not a game its pure goosebumps 
i was convinced they couldnt add no more content to gta online lol but they gotta keep us entertained somehow gta online is the appetizer but we all know what the main course is 
fico imaginando algum dia a rockstar conseguir fazer um mundo aberto para o gta com pelo menos uma regio de cada pas do mundo ou pelo menos os pases mais populares de cada regio iria ser insano se isto algum dia acontecesse
the drift handling and the drift mode are amazing

ufc",2092,"brandon royval just casually running 10 miles at 65minute pace is impressive dude has excellent cardio
leons first nfl game was one of the worst scoring games ever  30
my takeaways from this
i am absolutely exhausted watching pantoja workout what a demon
paddy catches a lot of shit when hes away from a hot mic regarding fighting he seems like a good guy
as an american i want to apologize to leon for attending that awful fuckin nfl game
heart says wonderboy 
brain says shavkat 
watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art shit is so impressive man
tony is 06 yet i still cant wait for his appearance on the embedded

guy really is a legend and a hell of an entertainer hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens
100 respect colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class how can you not respect it
you gotta respect colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class half of the champions in the ufc or more dont fight at their normal weight class
you can tell that colby is a good guy and just plays a character seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter  people have to separate the ppv selling colby from the person he seems to be
the flash of genuine colby when they brought out the candles you could tell he loved that
still makes me sad pantoja got booed after he won the belt he left it all in the octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears dad are your proud of me now  

i like both brandon and alexandre but im rooting for alexandre
you just cant hate thompson so humble
so pumped to see colby back in action the guy is a true gem of the sport hate or love him hes thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the octagon
really rooting for colby to get it done he is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat colby twice decisively
not a colby fan but i respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport he seems to always be in fighting shape he has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
thing i love the most about colby is he doesnt cut much weight maybe 4 kilos he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
cool seeing colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment this card is gonna be a banger 
man wonderboy does not look 40 years old at all 
seeing pantoja and jds so happy and down to earth is so damn wholesome
can tell colby is actually a really good dude his manners and respect to the waiter were absolutely tops ",17,Sports,17300000,PT9M25S,"['brandon royval just casually running mile 65minute pace impressive dude excellent cardio', 'leon first nfl game one the worst scoring game ever', 'takeaway from this', 'absolutely exhausted watching pantoja workout what demon', 'paddy catch lot shit when away from hot mic regarding fighting seems like good guy', 'american want apologize leon for attending that awful fuckin nfl game', 'heart say wonderboy', 'brain say shavkat', 'watching wonderboy strike like watching painter create work art shit impressive man', 'tony yet still cannot wait for his appearance the embedded', '', 'guy really legend and hell entertainer hope this his last rodeo whatever happens', '100 respect colby right one many few fighter the roster that really doe fight his weight class how can you not_ respect', 'you got respect colby for keeping real and fighting his weight class half the champion the ufc more not_ fight their normal weight class', 'you can tell that colby good guy and just play character seen many interaction from him like the one with the waiter people have separate the ppv selling colby from the person seems', 'the flash genuine colby when they brought out the candle you could tell loved that', 'still make sad pantoja got booed after won the belt left all the octagon and that interview had grown man tear dad are your proud now', '', 'like both brandon and alexandre but rooting for alexandre', 'you just cannot hate thompson humble', 'pumped see colby back action the guy true gem the sport hate love him thoroughly entertaining camera and the octagon', 'really rooting for colby get done fighting guy that hold two win over guy that beat colby twice decisively', 'not_ colby fan but respect his decision fight his natural weight class and his overall dedication the sport seems always fighting shape point about the dagistani guy being weight bully', 'thing love the most about colby doe not_ cut much weight maybe kilo are not_ weight bully like most the other guy', 'cool seeing colby being his true self and not_ the alter ego for moment this card going banger', 'man wonderboy doe not_ look year old all', 'seeing pantoja and jds happy and down earth damn wholesome', 'can tell colby actually really good dude his manner and respect the waiter were absolutely top']",565

i grew up playing classical music and its so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamberlike setting laufey says in her performance accompanied by a string quartet the singersongwriters modern jazzpop love songs soared at the tiny desk the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact

laufeys music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger mainstream audiences coming to the genre her sophomore album bewitched broke spotifys alltime streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platforms history and resulted in her first grammy nomination she opens the set with from the start a bouncy whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend connecting chet bakerlike scats with charming and playful lyrics taking a more melancholic turn into 2021s let you break my heart again and promise her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings creating a symphony of emotions laufey concludes the set with california and me which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by liszt and chopin this mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and musics ability to evoke raw unfiltered emotion

i cant think of a more npr artist than laufey perfect match
this is my first time hearing this melodious voice  laufey and her band woke me up this morning what a joy
is it just me but i cant help but admire her in every possible way
i wish this tiny desk would last like 1 hour 19 minutes of laufeys voice is not enough
that was unbelievable i had only ever heard the first song before i just cried my eyes out i cant remember the last time music i hadnt hear before hit me on such an emotional level such perfectly crafted songs such palpable melancholy i am overwhelmed in the best way possible
such a beautiful voice  ive listened to laufeys songs during the past few months and seeing her perfoming live at tiny desk is such a treat ive had teary eyes during promise  id love to see her live one day 
her voice scale control and timbre are just incredible she reminds me of ella in how she hits her lows new fan
what an honor to play chamber music with laufey on this series  hope soon again 
as a person who grew up in the classical music world fell in love with it and then had to leave it behind listening to you is simply a warm hug to the heart just thank you laufey amazing

 gojo dancing clip outro httpsyoutubehxhrle7eunk",1525,"i kinda expected hakari to be overwhelming i like the idea of old sorcerers being shook when they think because they are from the golden age they cant be challenged then hakari roles up with his goofy ass technique and goes ham
sukuna is interested in the executional swordso he tune down the slash to not kill them immediately
looking at the last panel those slashes look like the normal version not the existence cutting ones sukuna just said hes interested in the executioners sword so he might toy with higuruma a bit
yuji did something with that punch i just know it it didnt seem like anything significant at the time but theres no way that those guys are surviving regular slashes when ryo was turned into pork chops
not gonna lie gege is the real sukuna
i dont think its necessarily every slash of sukuna that can now cut the worldjust the ones he choosesprobably these were his normal dismantle slashes
we didnt see maki intervening the fight our crew did calculated something wrong but i think they mustve had another backup plan
well learn that kusakabe is actually just him and his simple domain is simply built different
546 your wrong that slashes are just a weaker version than the one that killed gojo sukuna is probably just playing with them just to intereste himself since he wants to see higurumas sword
im so excited because hakari is back
when yujis granddad said to die surrounded by the people he loved he didnt specify if they had to be alive yuji could die surrounded by the corpses of everyone in jujutsu high for all we know
even if sukunas ct got confiscated he still has his cursed tools damn he comes prepared
bold speculation suggeting all of sukunas attacks will only ever be the upgraded slashes and not something he toggles when he wants to use them
god this one seriously takes me off guard i really cant imagine what will happen because i can find no reason to our crew to not being cut in half just sukunas mood
hope they find a way cus i like so much all of the ones in the battlefield right now
no he is absolutely just going easy on the slashes he could 100 just do that massive world cutting slash and end them all but he doesnt he wants to fight since all the strongest sorcerers in the world are gathered in one place to fight him
maan gege aint conceding anything regarding sukuna lol every theory i had on how the fight will go depended on sukuna losing shrine add the kenjaku shenanigans plus this and i can safely say i have no idea how any of this will go down
with all that being said hakari is a beast and uraume better show us something
good luck on your college exams my guy thanks for the awesome video and leaks
im really hyped for the next chapter
i think the reason gege decided to take away the ct of the tool over the slashes was because of yuji yuji was stated to be a curse object soaked in sukunas curse energy since we already saw how purple did less damage to gojo because it was his own attack we can assume the same for slashes to yuji if he would have taken the slashes then yuji could have gotten one shotted by the curse tool made by a thousand binding vows

bidstrup took it like a legend huge respect
editwtf i checked my phone cuz i thought this comment got 1 like 
its always a long wait for a new video from chris but when it finally arrives its a piece of cinematic gold
the video weve all been waiting for let us know if you wanna play for us soon 
to everyone in the comments check out our channel for more chris vs mads content 
i swear harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 
bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
you notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round they are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge small things but big differences
manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
chris dashing the ball at w2s mum brought it to another level 
awesome to see levi colwill in this video met him when sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against hamworthy united
the pros were all really down to earth thats cool to see
the way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
bidstrups a class guy seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to gurnsey to record that clip with harrys mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
chris is one of the best youtube football dribblers he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still wont preform the same in a charity match
crazy that bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is di maria  benfica has just won 31 salzburg
di maria scoring a corner goal absolutely insaneee

december 4th will forever be one of the best days of our lives 

an adoption is finalized when all of the necessary postplacement requirements have been met when people ask when does the adoption become final for the adopting parents in most adoptions the final adoption hearing occurs around six months after placement although some hearings can happen as little as three months or up to a year after placement

traditionally adoption finalization occurs in a courtroom although more and more judges are offering final adoption hearings over videocall or phone call your adoption specialist and adoption attorney will work together to schedule this hearing and ensure you are prepared for any questions that may be asked during this process

we love you all so much
dallin and bella

good bye large cameraman your heroic act will never be forgotten 
this series never disappoints cool
looks like the cameraman found the skibidi lab bases sound like this is gonna be an interesting episode
mad respect for the large cameraman he risked his life for recording 67 from 14 now  he is in peace you will be remembered man
press f to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman
rest in peace large cameraman 
you were loved and you helped the cameraman find the factory and protected everyone 
you will be missed
gran cmaraman tiene mis respetos muri como un gran guerrero que hasta el final protegi a sus compaeros si dudar 
rest in peacelarge cameraman youve been a brave soldieryou will never be forgotten
presione f para presentar sus respetos al camargrafo grande l era el punto de vista del episodio 67 merece respeto por sacrificarse
agora sim o dafuqboom se surpreendeu no roteiro deixou os tits de lado e mostrou o que os personagens secundrios so capazes os personagens vo morrendo aos poucos na fbrica dos skibidis isso  insano e tenso epica luta a desse episdio
this almost made me cry rip large cameraman  rpg he will always be remembered and be in our hearts we only got to see him in the previous episode same as 66 also with his last lives he still did a thumbs up still in pain
respect to that large cameraman rest in peace
dafuq as i didnt see almost anyone talking im going to say you probably wont see this video but it doesnt matter im sending my strength to you man every time i go into the comments i see people talking about how the video is or so saying that you are no longer the same im not saying that this second is all of them but anyway i came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us and for what you have to go through with rude comments i dont know how you are behind that screen but i hope you are well they will probably tell me if anyone sees this you deserve a rest man take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity go out with your friends and go to a place to rest your mind well i just said that because im really worried about your psychology all the work you do when it comes to being private motherfucker saying skibidi skibidi all the time and in return getting insults that youre not the same anymore thats it probably no one will read this but its here now im less worried
what i love about episode 68 is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also rip large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
dude the large characters are the underappreciated heroes seeing as the large speakerman died then the large cameraman that might mean that large tv man is next on the chopping block rip large cameraman
wow inspiring to say the least a year ago today i was standing on a 351849 mile long sandwich  which too be fair had no mustard and was about to eat it all  this video along with the tuna song saved me

etherealworkshop evolayersen",470,"flasque has become by far my new favourite monster i cant even describe how much i love him his sound is unreal
the plasma quad being a banshee is actually genius
all references of number of elements in the design
meebkin three fingers three bumps on tail  head crest three creatures meebkin itself and two meebs
gaddzooks three eyes three toes three mouths
yooreek three fingers 
blarret three mouths three nails
auglur three hands
nitebear three eyes three toes three fingers brown hand three body sections brown half blue half greenish head
flasque three sections of the head three toes three floating flasks
whaill four toes
fun fact gadzooks now has a new track the one that was teased but was never shown on the new island
was not expecting how these new monsters would sound but i do like them all a lot it is nice to see the island be extended with these additions and while there is still a long way to go i can already start to see the direction this island will take
i cant wait to hear what the rest of the song brings these new guys are all great
flasque is so satisfying to hear its like monster asmr
i love how nitebear is straight up inspired from fnaf but also keeping it original
whaill adds so much more to the song now im curious for what the full song will be like
you can already tell that this island is gonna look chaotic and sound amazing when its done
theyve changed the vibe of the song completely
im glad we got a metal clanging sound it fits the workshop vibe my only complaint is the whaill verse it sounds cool but it doesnt flow too well into the next verse
was wondering when gadzooks second track would be implemented  love the new verse  song is beautiful so far
flasque is putting in such insane work
i love how they added another track for gaddzooks and how nitebear is based on fnaf whaill looks absolutely great as well the msm developers really are putting their love into the game
i have an affinity towards mech elementals thanks to vhamp and nitebear had satisfied my cravings as a fnaf fan the other 2 are great too
damn this sounds great cant wait for future updates
i thought this island was gonna be ruined by more monsters but they definitely made it better
honestly i wish the other more stable ethereals were on the island but it is really good

pokemon legendarypokemon infinitefusion",532,"pokemon fusions are one thing but the fact things like deoxys and regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
the only thing i regret is not fusing more legendaries with magikarp
i actually like this twist to a fusions playthrough because we get to see the coolerrarer fusions
no chance john wins that champion battle without tyler he really saved the day
the miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now tysm john and tyler for putting this in
i love that john still names his requazas gregory after that epic jmc episode in season 1 
i also love how john plays this game we all know legends are the most fun to fuse xd
935 loving the ben 10 reference with this one been rewatching it this week for the first time since i was a kid and just finished my first ever infinite fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a chronosapienclockwork reference in this fangame i hope you do more videos on it
pm7 providing top notch quality videos right when im about to eat lunch lovely
i love all the screams tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
how can you follow up giratina square
lance another one
roger is one of my favourite fusions ive seen across all infinite fusion content love the videos john
that raikouhydreigon is so sick that could definitely be a boss battle in dark souls or something
ive always wanted to play infinite fusion but just have never found the time its nice to see someone exploring all the fun legendary fusions
i cant believe it he actually evolved feesh raydos might look awesome but itll never recapture the image of rayeesh
i seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 
lets go clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurkdialga fusion
2531 that just about killed me
its never too late to do a playthough of a game ive seen lots of infinite fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it really looking forward to the next part
also i think the catch rate might be higher in this game or fluctuate depending on the fusion but i was still left in suspense at all the captures
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level so you dont see slugmas and pichus in the elite 4
super happy youre planning to do another video on this game im a spriter for the game and id love to see you use some of my legendary fusions they wont be in the game until january though due to the update schedule for sprites",20,Gaming,819000,PT35M47S,"['pokemon fusion are one thing but the fact thing like deoxys and regigigas and just chillin foot outside town should really worrying the local', 'the only thing regret not_ fusing more legendaries with magikarp', 'actually like this twist fusion playthrough because get see the coolerrarer fusion', 'chance john win that champion battle without tyler really saved the day', 'the miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro ingraved memory now tysm john and tyler for putting this', 'love that john still name his requazas gregory after that epic jmc episode season', 'also love how john play this game all know legend are the most fun fuse', '935 loving the ben reference with this one been rewatching this week for the first time since kid and just finished first ever infinite fusion playthrough really fitting see chronosapienclockwork reference this fangame hope you more video', 'pm7 providing top notch quality video right when about eat lunch lovely', 'love all the scream tyler put when reveals the fusion had the floor', 'how can you follow giratina square', 'lance another one', 'roger one favourite fusion have seen across all infinite fusion content love the video john', 'that raikouhydreigon sick that could definitely bos battle dark soul something', 'have always wanted play infinite fusion but just have never found the time nice see someone exploring all the fun legendary fusion', 'cannot believe actually evolved feesh raydos might look awesome but will never recapture the image rayeesh', 'seemed always miss the wheel spin and just kept getting surprised the current round fusion', 'let clockwork perfect inspiration for that golurkdialga fusion', '2531 that just about killed', 'never too late playthough game have seen lot infinite fusion playthroughs and this fun take really looking forward the next part', 'also think the catch rate might higher this game fluctuate depending the fusion but still left suspense all the capture', 'the only issue have with these kind randomizers that becomes too easy the end but most randomizers have seetting make use fully evolved only after certain level you not_ see slugmas and pichus the elite', 'super happy you are planning another video this game spriter for the game and love see you use some legendary fusion they will not_ the game until january though due the update schedule for sprite']",2147

props to keith and becky for keeping their baby very private shows theyre already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them
the mystery event is 100 a 24 hour livestream of eugene sitting on keiths lap
so much respect for keith and becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality ahem that is the way to raise a child as a public figure congrats to you both
i appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to eugene the fact that hes off making his dreams come true and they dont make him pick try guys over that is amazing hes still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy 
i cant believe the return of candid competition isnt the biggest announcement thats incredible news
i consider kwesi an official try guy he fits so well hes so perfect so funny and sweet
even though the situation that caused it was awful i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible the variance of content the variance of oncamera personalities its all such a breath of fresh air theres so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now there really is something for everyone
i miss eugene but were all proud of him and excited for everything hes a part of i struggle with change but yall make it exciting
i would love to see another episode about zach talking about his chronic pain management him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot
the best thing try guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in jared kwesi johnny marissa are the best additions to the try family
okay i gotta say you guys blow my mind i first arrived here because of the event but i stayed here because i liked your personality and because i was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or dumb they are in the past year ive been learning more and more about how you manage the company how you create more content etc and wow i respect it so much and this video just confirmed it even more for me
honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the keith and zach channel and eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and zach and keith have always been my favorite try guys
ive said it before and ill say it again this channel has the most talented editors every single video looks so incredible
i really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen so happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth
i am so damn proud of them to see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years i am so damn proud
we miss eugene when hes not here but im so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them i hope it all turn out great for him 3
the way they are so candid about why theyre charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on youtube is incredible honestly i love that about them
i love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship

fyi there is also passive income if you buy the tow truck and the wall safe upgrade so keep in mind avoid the staff upgrade unless you have spare money so keep in mind should work like the one in the auto shop this comment is for beginners only
i got my eyes on the new mustang finally a proper modern mustang
just done the cayo perico start to finish exactly the same way taco does it and i only noticed one small change 
it the intel gather mission when you steal the plane to fly to the island the driver side door is no longer stuck open this is excellent for my ocd 
i regret choosing the most expensive location hard to get into shop gang attack could spawn and cars dont always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the moc to have the leds from the christmas truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 here is your weekly update video including all of the things added in the winter dlc chop shop what do you think of this new dlc so far more vids coming throughout the day
prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane
the range rover was on my very short list along with the escalade v and that 96 impala ss was an amazing surprise but im still hurt about no new   dubsta aka g5563 its got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community the turismo and the chop shop are the only things ill have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me
the new grotti drives so damn nice liking the new declasse impaler lx but i just love them type of muscle cars anyway the vigero zx and dominator are pretty cool but i still prefer the roof up best feature so far the garage organizer
the vehicle prices are crazy  i wish it was more like real life
tuner update and chop shop are my fav so far love the low grips and manual stick
so far so good this is a solid dlc its a w from me still would have liked to have a heist with this dlc as well but its all good
top tier i appreciate the time and effort put into the vids

the car selection for this update is quite nice loving the infiniti and the camry
another change that i noticed on ps is when you fire the avenger turrets it changes to a different turret they made it the same button
well i actually like the interaction menu updates there are less items in each category now makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier will this change speed runs
im probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle but im hyped that we can get the cluckin bell van and omg the baller std only rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
done my first complete salvage mission start to finish took almost 2 hours without knowing what the heck i was doing mind and made gta350000 from it

website httpswwwtntsportscouk",618,"miller on 300 is a great call unbelievable career and he absolutely deserves a spot on that card
as much as i do love dana i think he cares more about this jones  stipe fight than any of the fans do
and adam never stepped foot in the war room again after that role play bit 
bro just sorted out jim miller what a man
jim miller ufc 100200 and now 300 what a carrier hes had
danas face on 823  i cant cope
aspinal should only be fighting for the title at this point
that role play def went better in your head  great interview as always bro
i really want to find someone actually still interested in the jones v stipe fight even when the fight got cancelled i was infinitely more excited about the tom v pav fight 

now that we have to wait even longer for it its just going to feel more and more anticlimactic by the time the fight actually comes around 

the ufc has always moved with the times better than any other sports organisation but on this subject this is one of those rare times that i feel theyre going in the wrong direction
the fans want aspinall fighting for gold
so freaking excited for saturday i am fully expecting covington to win but im just so pumped for the whole card cant wait to watch it
i dont see the reasoning why jones and stipe deserve to fight eachother ahead of aspinall deserve is such a compicated word nobody deserves anything unless they earn it how has a guy whos fought once at heavyweight and another guy who lost his last fight years ago earned the right to be at the top of the pile meanwhile aspinall is fighting anyone he can get his hands on at short notice and saving cards and he gets told to wait its absolutely stinks
fair play to catterall he just got jim miller on the 300 card miller owes him a drink
ive never been to a ufc event and i would love nothing more than to one day go to one
aspinall vs miocic makes so much sense would be a great fight for 300
821 danas face 
get aspinall to the new co op arena in manchester next year will be the biggest arena in the uk
jim miller in ufc 300 really needs to hapoen been saying it for weeks
thats a world record in itself

watching courtney win at the end was like watching a clown pull a handkerchief out of their pocket
courtney constantly checking noahs hand was funny
courtney did the most dramatic win on uno ever
the way they referenced grace chastity in the intro makes me wish for a smosh cameo in the hatchet field cinematic universe
ive always been under the impression that every uno game is brutalbut dang this wild
first they broke angelas body then 30 killed her spirit
angela just probably took the term break a leg too literally and broke an arm instead
having angela play a card game with a broken arm was wild 
courtneys 46 might be the best thing ive ever seen in my life 
them using angelas nerdy prudes picture and their impressions of her is amazing

drumeo nandibushell twistedsister",1839,"thank you so much drumeo for inviting me on i had the best time
aj pero was a criminally underrated drummer  lots of people are unaware at how good he really was
a great fresh version of a classic

her innocence when she says  i like how they all dressed up for the video
keep rocking nandi great work 
if you want to try this and many other drumless songs get a 7day free trial to check out drumeo  httpwwwdrumeocomtrial
shes 1000x better at this age then ill ever be in my life  so much talent and work
absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer its truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age i can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums the precision timing and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable a true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself
she effin killed it  her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing  i was super impressed  im not as surprised now to see how foo fighters identified her skill so long ago  this was incredible  no offense to twisted sister but i think she really turned it up to 11
that was phenomenal you can see how nandis taken all of the lessons from chad smith and dave grohl to heart so happy to hear her keeping rock alive id say her drums worked better in places than the original track she had more fills and had some double kick in places one of the best in this series
this was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 
her talent just shines in this video  what a great take on that song
her approach brings such a late 90searly 00s poppunk vibe to the whole song if that version were released in that era it still would have been a hit
what i love about nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is you can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that
i love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hihat that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when its metal
she is so impressive with not only how she plays which is outstanding but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly
aj is smiling down at this best series hands down shes so effin talented 
nandi is so awesome what an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid this was pure joy
i gotta saythis was amazing nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before wow wow wow 
im so psyched to see nandi on here  love her drumming love her energy this is an amazing performance  so many little things match up with her version and the original  cant wait to see more of nandi here  i know the guys of twisted sister will love this
nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with dave grohl im very impressed shes got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that dont overwhelm the overall song great work from her and i think once her gcses and a levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one
i like the way nandi is already a better drummer than most 80s hair metal bands ever had",27,Education,3310000,PT9M40S,"['thank you much drumeo for inviting had the best time', 'pero criminally underrated drummer lot people are unaware how good really', 'great fresh version classic', '', 'her innocence when she say like how they all dressed for the video', 'keep rocking nandi great work', 'you want try this and many other drumless song get 7day free trial check out drumeo', 'she 1000x better this age then ill ever life much talent and work', 'absolutely blown away the incredible drumming skill this young drummer truly impressive witness such talent such young age can only dream reaching her level mastery the drum the precision timing and energy she brings her performance are truly remarkable true inspiration for aspiring drummer like myself', 'she effin killed her interpretation the cowbell amazing super impressed not_ surprised now see how foo fighter identified her skill long ago this incredible offense twisted sister but think she really turned', 'that phenomenal you can see how nandis taken all the lesson from chad smith and dave grohl heart happy hear her keeping rock alive say her drum worked better place than the original track she had more fill and had some double kick place one the best this series', 'this both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive the same time beyond having great chop she also show good understanding song structure and how drive song forward', 'her talent just shine this video what great take that song', 'her approach brings such late 90searly 00s poppunk vibe the whole song that version were released that era still would have been hit', 'what love about nandi and seeing her play how enthusiastic she you can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she posse make all emotional watching her her element like that', 'love her inclination gallop the cymbal and hihat that make for really fun drum listen especially when metal', 'she impressive with not_ only how she play which outstanding but also just how she handle everything being thrown her effortlessly', 'smiling down this best series hand down she effin talented', 'nandi awesome what incredible talent and seems like such sweet kid this pure joy', 'got saythis amazing nandi killed the drum and never heard the song before wow wow wow', 'psyched see nandi here love her drumming love her energy this amazing performance many little thing match with her version and the original cannot wait see more nandi here know the guy twisted sister will love this', 'nandi come long way from her drum battle with dave grohl very impressed she got very mature way playing where she keep very digestible yet compelling fill that not_ overwhelm the overall song great work from her and think once her gcse and level are done she should definitely hit the road with band that she and her peer create they create one', 'like the way nandi already better drummer than most hair metal band ever had']",580

yoshimitsu is ready to slice and dice the competition in tekken8",3409,"yoshimitsu doing yoshimitsu things is always beautiful to watch
this mans design is always so hype
yoshimitsu is the goat
yoshimitsus design is unique in every game hes in and i love it everytime 
this is definitely one of the best yoshimitsu designs and mechanized space ninja is just a beautiful string of words
its so cool that they finally incorporated his backstory of his sword into his playstyle and his outros
the design moves blade attacks and the attack animations are seriously insane 
i like how you can see his fingers to remind you that he is human some of his designs really push the idea of him being something else
this looks like the best version of yoshimitsu in years aesthetically speaking and his move set looks a lot more fluid in the trailer lets hope he plays as well as he looks
fun fact everyone eagerly anticipates for yoshimitsus design whenever a new tekken game is announced 
that was amazing my goodness one of the trailers i was most eager to see and it delivered there is absolutely nothing from him that i disliked or thought was meh that he brought with him and demonstrated as he returned one of the best looking rage arts and his design its simple yet really cool and not overly designed just like in tekken 3 and 4 which is the way i really like it i think it is finally time to main him again in tekken i only used him a lot in tekken 3 tekken 4 and the soul calibur games
yoshimitsu is looking fire in this one and  also love that they included a special intro with brian basically a nod back to the revenge plot from t5
simplesmente o personagem com o design mais diferenciado vlw a pena esperar perfeito d 
yoshimitsu has always been one of my mains and this will be no different
i love the fact that they gave yoshimitsu most of his soulcalibur moves plus his chemistry with bryan is second to none
never a tekken game without yoshimitsu
yoshimitsu never dissapoints us 
i cannot wait to play him his playstyle and design are all amazing
tekken is pouring some absolute love in their franchise this design is straight up 
wowthis is amazing and what a great character yoshimitsu is we really missed him too much the appearance of him between ninja and samurai is quite surprising i think he will be one of my favorite characters like in the old days be careful bryan here we go hahaha thank you very much namcobandai you are truly geniuses",20,Gaming,1090000,PT2M26S,"['yoshimitsu doing yoshimitsu thing always beautiful watch', 'this man design always hype', 'yoshimitsu the goat', 'yoshimitsus design unique every game and love everytime', 'this definitely one the best yoshimitsu design and mechanized space ninja just beautiful string word', 'cool that they finally incorporated his backstory his sword into his playstyle and his outros', 'the design move blade attack and the attack animation are seriously insane', 'like how you can see his finger remind you that human some his design really push the idea him being something else', 'this look like the best version yoshimitsu year aesthetically speaking and his move set look lot more fluid the trailer let hope play well look', 'fun fact everyone eagerly anticipates for yoshimitsus design whenever new tekken game announced', 'that amazing goodness one the trailer most eager see and delivered there absolutely nothing from him that disliked thought meh that brought with him and demonstrated returned one the best looking rage art and his design simple yet really cool and not_ overly designed just like tekken and which the way really like think finally time main him again tekken only used him lot tekken tekken and the soul calibur game', 'yoshimitsu looking fire this one and also love that they included special intro with brian basically nod back the revenge plot from', 'simplesmente personagem com design mais diferenciado vlw pena esperar perfeito', 'yoshimitsu always been one main and this will different', 'love the fact that they gave yoshimitsu most his soulcalibur move plus his chemistry with bryan second none', 'never tekken game without yoshimitsu', 'yoshimitsu never dissapoints', 'cannot wait play him his playstyle and design are all amazing', 'tekken pouring some absolute love their franchise this design straight', 'wowthis amazing and what great character yoshimitsu really missed him too much the appearance him between ninja and samurai quite surprising think will one favorite character like the old day careful bryan here hahaha thank you very much namcobandai you are truly genius']",146

honestly colby is so real for having that fear its definitely one you dont really think about but most of us probably have
wildlife biologist here that hissing in the shack sounded like an opossum to me  other animals like marmots will hiss like that a gutteral hiss not the silkiness of a snake hiss it was probably looking for bugs or rodents and upset you disturbed its hunt 
imagine being a ghost and seeing the bathtub full of water and getting all excited to take yourself a little ghostly soak so you turn the jets on and suddenly everyone freaks out

manchesterunited mufc",1438,"david de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade i hate how he was brushed aside
ten hag in his post match said we played well and we didnt deserve to lose
i cant believe you actually thought they would win mark  with that team  we are manchester united  yep a midtable team with horrible players and management  it will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4
but mark you have to admit that other than martinez ten hags signings have been just terrible and very expensive
the problem is that because eth rates players like onana antony mount and mctominay i dont rate him
karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like its gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
figure it out eth wanted onanahe got him  not the glazers eth accountability
what does accountability of ten hag mean if a possibility of firing him isnt on the table
manchester united are the first premier league side to finish bottom of their ucl group on two occasions also 200506  record breakers also the first english side to concede 15 goals in ucl
onana has been a revelation in goala terrible revelation that ten hag has no fkin clue cheers erik
for me its mainoo simple as thatthe kids got a needle eye for a through ball and hes brave enough to attempt it we need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him we cant be playing side to side long balls all the effin time like why is this kid not constantly starting
the biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
we pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
david is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment
ten hag is sacking himself playing mctominay keep starting onana not subbing off bruno kmt if he gets the sack he deserves it  he can blame no one but himself kmt
a lot of people dont wanna hear it but bruno ruins the team its not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much either a terrible pass or a terrible shot occasionally hell slap a beauty but most of the time hes a losing factor either way hes way too risky if you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position his attitude stinks complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in honestly he has to go and mctominay 
dont get me started on mctominay
youll blame anyone and everyone other than erik ten hag for the team he manages
as you sit and listen to mark defend eths job after this just remember mark unironically believed manchester united would win the cl this season he said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had
if you go from believing we can win the competition only to come 4th in a favourable group then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable 

eth spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at lcb as an excuse for his ego trip with varane and then tonight kept him at lcb while evans played rcb he constantly talks about standards but onana who has now led us to being the english team who has conceded the most goals in a cl group stage ever got to play every game despite costing us points the sooner this guy is gone the better
i dont see why we signed bayindir when he hasnt played a game surely hes good enough to play cup games
they sanctioned onanas  deal because they believed in ten hag who is now showing us how clueless he is we need to get rid of him with the immediate effect",17,Sports,1790000,PT39M41S,"['david gae kept utd from bottom the league table for decade hate how brushed aside', 'ten hag his post match said played well and did not_ deserve lose', 'cannot believe you actually thought they would win mark with that team are manchester united yep midtable team with horrible player and management will take year get this team back even consider fighting for top', 'but mark you have admit that other than martinez ten hag signing have been just terrible and very expensive', 'the problem that because eth rate player like onana antony mount and mctominay not_ rate him', 'karma boy laughed liverpool year wait for title looking like gunna lot longer wait for are absolute mess and off the pitch', 'figure out eth wanted onanahe got him not_ the glazer eth accountability', 'what doe accountability ten hag mean possibility firing him not_ the table', 'manchester united are the first premier league side finish bottom their ucl group two occasion also 200506 record breaker also the first english side concede goal ucl', 'onana been revelation goala terrible revelation that ten hag fkin clue cheer erik', 'for mainoo simple thatthe kid got needle eye for through ball and brave enough attempt need central midfielder who can play through the space front him cannot playing side side long ball all the effin time like why this kid not_ constantly starting', 'the biggest disgrace all mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buy the player pick the team and decides what tactic play', 'pay world class wage third rate underdog', 'david laughing his off and enjoying every single moment', 'ten hag sacking himself playing mctominay keep starting onana not_ subbing off bruno kmt get the sack deserves can blame one but himself kmt', 'lot people not_ want hear but bruno ruin the team not_ just his attitude but loses the ball too much either terrible pas terrible shot occasionally hell slap beauty but most the time losing factor either way way too risky you watch him play into strike pushing our striker out their position his attitude stink complaining the player constantly when they make mistake but take accountability when make selfish play and sky the ball when shoot free kick from mile away instead whipping pas honestly and mctominay', 'not_ get started mctominay', 'you will blame anyone and everyone other than erik ten hag for the team manages', 'you sit and listen mark defend eths job after this just remember mark unironically believed manchester united would win the this season said this despite knowing who the manager and the player had', 'you from believing can win the competition only come 4th favourable group then the manager blamed and his job clearly untenable', '', 'eth spent week saying needed left footed player lcb excuse for his ego trip with varane and then tonight kept him lcb while evans played rcb constantly talk about standard but onana who now led being the english team who conceded the most goal group stage ever got play every game despite costing point the sooner this guy gone the better', 'not_ see why signed bayindir when not_ played game surely good enough play cup game', 'they sanctioned onanas deal because they believed ten hag who now showing how clueless need get rid him with the immediate effect']",2381

the kelly clarkson show is the uplifting daytime destination for humor and connection featuring emmywinning talk show grammywinning artist and americas original idol kelly clarkson",627,"kelly backing away from the mic in order not to overpower him thats one of the many reasons i love her
the reason kelly easily complements her duet partners and even oftentimes hold back is because she has no ego shes completely confident in herself as a vocalist and artist that her principal goal in that moment is create beautiful art with another artist many can learn a lesson for two from kelly
so much respect to kelly for truly taking the background on this song with teddy and letting him shine what a great collab
kelly actually giving teddy the stage and not shadow him is top respect 
 they need to go on head and recut that in the studio
kelly is the queen of letting her guests shine while also harmonizing with them perfectly and also finding some great moments for her own voice to shine through like the amazing gift that it is  utter perfection  and she looks so amazing glad shes healthy and happy  nyc is such a perfect fit for her
been watching teddy since the plain ol white walled garage sessions love them together kelly knows good when she hears it
more people need to collaborate with kelly  her voices compliments everyone  sign of true talent
this duet inspired me to further explore who teddy swims is thats how flawless this performance was they should go to the studio record and release this as a duet single absolutely amazing
teddy is absolutely fabulous and with kelly in the mix that was just like heaven 
kelly can do no wrong 3
love teddys soulful voice and kelly knows just how to complement him with her fabulous yet not overpowering background vocals and harmonies terrific performance 
the admiration she has for other artists and grace she gives them while performing is very rare in this business
waited two hours after watching the show and listening to the music video 7 times just to bring it back to the tv collaboration that ive become obsessed with  massive love to kelly for putting teddy on because this was 
her harmonies are slept on she can compliment and let people shine no ego love  love  love 
   dang they need to write a single together
this is a duet i have been dying to hear  teddy is the bomb and kelly wellshe is kelly nuf said bravo
ive been a big fan of teddys for years but every time i hear this song i still get goosebumps
kelly is a class act pulls back to give the the duet partner the moment generosity at its utmost

now he knows what its like to play the chiefs 
the call was 100 correct chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
for those who didnt watch snf tonight

this penalty was called once in 2021 twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season 

so it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials and the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasnt some conspiracy 

mahomes reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled
there has been a lot of bad officiating this season 

this was an example of good officiating
hes looking at the baaaaaaaall  and still line up off sidewow
chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldnt happen at such an important point of the game  we should go back and see what the eagles think about the holding call in the super bowl last year chiefs werent complaining then
never understood why any player whatever the position would line up offside  these guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do  you dont even have to move your bod just use a couple of neck muscles turn your head and look  unbelievable
because the chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him the bills won this game and they dont even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral 
still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
if youre lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next to you to see the ball  youre offsides  how did toney not realize the ball and center was behind him
doesnt matter how many times it was called before you know the rules offsides is offsides end of story he could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches he knew the game was at stake and if he didnt know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known
he was looking right at the ball how could he not know to move back thats on him
whats shocking is that toney didnt drop the lateral from kelce
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral
ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
as a broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
it does look like offsides but what a cool play the chiefs are an amazing team
geez that was a great throw a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting td would have been fun in highlight reels kelce probably cant reenact that lastsecond pass what a shame",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S,"['congratulation bill you beat the chief and made them cry win for all football fan', 'now know what like play the chief', 'the call 100 correct chief have one blame but themselves', 'for those who did not_ watch snf tonight', '', 'this penalty called once 2021 twice last year and time coming into the game this season', '', 'obviously point emphasis for official and the flag thrown immediately upon the snap not_ some conspiracy', '', 'mahomes reaction really rubbing wrong and come off spoiled', 'there been lot bad officiating this season', '', 'this example good officiating', 'looking the baaaaaaaall and still line off sidewow', 'chief are arguing that such ticky tack call should not_ happen such important point the game should back and see what the eagle think about the holding call the super bowl last year chief were not_ complaining then', 'never understood why any player whatever the position would line offside these guy have been playing this game their whole life and are the best what they you not_ even have move your bod just use couple neck muscle turn your head and look unbelievable', 'because the chief have gotten many favorable call over the year mahomes wanted all the spotlight him the bill won this game and they not_ even get applauded for because the only thing that people are going remembering from this game this play where the penalty rightly called mahomes doe not_ need get mad the ref need get mad his receiver for lining offside', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'still one the best play seen this year bad toney did not_ look where standing', 'you are lined receiver and you have look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next you see the ball you are offside how did toney not_ realize the ball and center behind him', 'doe not_ matter how many time called before you know the rule offside offside end story could have just easily went the line and moved his foot back few inch knew the game stake and did not_ know offside then the person next him should have known', 'looking right the ball how could not_ know move back that him', 'what shocking that toney did not_ drop the lateral from kelce', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'have always wondered why back lateral were not_ used more they are used effectively flag football know there contact bit easier but done correctly there alot open play for tds like this one', 'bronco fan put joy heart seeing him like this', 'doe look like offside but what cool play the chief are amazing team', 'geez that great throw great catch and amazing pas ending with exciting would have been fun highlight reel kelce probably cannot reenact that lastsecond pas what shame']",65

ufc",2367,"the fact that wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
always rooting for wonderboy hes a great role model love seeing him teach the kids karate
if the ufc made a show about wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome id never miss an episode
thompson is unreal he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
this was one of the most positive and happy embedded ive seen happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week theyll need it for the presser
such a heartwarming embedded even someone im not a fan of like paddy hes a good dude at heart good to see
im proud of wonderboys facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight but ensuring that they get their homework done
wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act its honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
123 i respect wonderboy so much he knows to his core all his skills took time years  years of honing what hes teaching these children  by simply picking them up from school a world class fighter you have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds we all got in this art from watching movies i cant imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training
since everyone is talking about how great wonderboy is 

right after the luque fight i ran into him at disneyland i was a single rider on the smugglers run ride and ended up with him and his family i was so stoked i told him my wife cant ride because she is with my 2 year old son and he said well youre part of our family for this ride now

after the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son he was seriously the nicest guy id ever met it was something ill never forget
wonderboy really is that dude great human being
why cant wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years hes one of the nicest guys on the planet and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
the fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing ive ever seen
we need more fighters like wonderboy in gyms everywhere a good man is hard to find
brandon royval and stephen thompson seem like genuinely good guysrole models really nice to see that
paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell hes a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan 
im rooting for royval and edwards 
but it aint going to be easy 
what a great card to end the year
paddys honestly a great dude fighter or not the guys got my admiration
i know ufc doesnt wanna take the focus away from their fight night cards but you really should build up these big ppv events for more than just a week hype usually takes a bit of time to build properly

barrett that no way to treat a fellow member of judgement day  even wade is on truths side
finn started laughing when truth dissed jd mcdonough truth can make almost anyone break character hah hah
rtruth needs to be apart of the judgement day
r truth is just the kind of uplifting personality we need in the jd
truth has been so epic since his return an ageless legend
is a shakeup for the judgment day on the horizon 
i love finns very genuine i like him and then he gives him the lightest kick during the jumping and then backs off while the others do it feels very ah come on guys do we have to jump the funny man
bruh he had finn breaking character and he aint even hiding it lmao
finn broke character when he said jd needs to go lol
dang i was really hoping for r truth to somehow become a member of the judgement day wouldve been funny if he became a member because of damian having a soft spot for truth lol
rtruth joining judgment day could be like when sami joined the bl itd be content
rtruth going to the hall of fame
they really could have had a bloodline sami type of storyline with this leading to rtruth having a run that can actually be taken seriously
damian struggles not to break around truth 
that julius creed move on jd and dom was sick
jd you gotta get out no one likes you

gets me everytime 
rtruth is a hall of famer idc what anyone says his ability to constantly entertain the crowd with whatever gimmick wwe gives him is amazing remember this dude entertained the crowd for months with an imaginary friend he made the 247 championship worth watching the moment they took it away from him nobody cared about it anymore and they had to retire it hes good on the mic and hes lowkey good in the ring just never really gets a chance to show it i know he doesnt have the accolades but hes a true entertainer

music by kevin macleod httpsincompetechcom",2540,"missy is just literally the chillest creature out of everyone in this game shes so kumbaya and i need that i wish i had her energy
given how poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this i do hope she wont become this final hidden main antagonist
the fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is lowkey respectable great job man
i actually theorize that we wont meet catnap as this giant monster right away but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat however once he learns that poppy apposes the prototype it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form keep in mind that catnap can adjust the proportions of his body hes a sizeshifter
this game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
the character that is being tortured and strapped is dogday the leader of the smiling critters dogday is also the one of the screenshot coming out of a large tube we see him chasing the player on the trailer as well coming out of that same tube i believe that the guy on the phone saying this is what he does to heretics etc is dr harley the doctor sawyer from project playtime i am not sure but his voice is surely the same voice actor the dr was also the one responsible for the monsters the project being called the bigger bodies innitiative
the little critters were so cute in a creepy way seeing them with long human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel for me that made them look scarier than the plushie version i also noticed the stitches on the arms if they are working with the prototype maybe it helped make them biggertaller and safer we know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys
ill be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 
the scratch on the wall fully says fate awaits those who believe also that character we see tied up actually looks like the dog it has the same ears and if you look closely that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth this character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us
i think 1901 says peace awaits those who believe im really excited for the game though thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us mike
chapter 3 is lookin very good so far also massive props to mob entertainment just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story just cant wait to see it now xd
man i cant even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see catnap and something tells me that this is going to be the scariest chapter ever
my theory on nightmare huggy is that its the same one from chapter one but under the influence of catnap who saw how obedient huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again  through catnaps orders
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went wild  or rabid  the fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting cant wait to see  whos the real bad guy or something
given how much information is in this next chapter i wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe theyll do one more and then end the game it seems like were going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so i would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype also i just thought of this but its possible the player is a toy themselves if they were a bigger bodies toy they would be working in the factory have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged
one of the biggest things i cannot wait for is seeing how the player and poppy interact with kissy but why do i have this strange feeling like red flags are being raised that shell sacrifice herself to save poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter

idk id be happy if kissy lived but i guess we will have to wait and see
yo the voice lines from poppy it sounds so chilling shes actively trying to save people and kissy missy yes i knew she would be involved that would actually be so cool i really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people not just you were secretly the bad guy
one important aspect is that the smiling cirtters or atleast catnap are made entirely of a special fluid material that gives them the ability to manifest their form they can be as small as a mouse or as tall as a giraffe
knowing kissy will help us in this chapter i cant help but fathom that shell probably face off against against catnap near the end of the chapter to maybe buy us some time to escape

upset over a blatant penalty man if mahomes reacted like this over that imagine how he would have reacted if the chiefs got the same treatment the bills got in the bills eagles game refs totally screwed them
after looking at the replay our guy clearly lined up offsides the refs had to call it same type of dumbass move that we did in the afc championship several years ago when one of you defensive players lined up off side when we intercepted brady to nullify the play and lose the game mahomes needs to aim his anger in the right direction  his own man we deserved to lose and will cont to do so with this lousy offense too bad  wasting a very good defense this year
just a straight up fair amd square loss for the chiefs unfortunately they had an offsides that seemingly cost them the win or atleast lead really unprofessional and pathetic that your starting quarterback has a temper tantrum on the sidelines yelling at the refs for doing their jobs well
the chiefs had their chances to win and they didnt get it done
classic man gets so many calls his way over the years gets a few called against him and he has an aneurism
all i have to say is that chiefs fans got a little taste of what its like to be a bills fan for the last 30 years
legend has it that mahomes is still screaming on the sideline
via adam schefter on twitter

chiefs hc andy reid was not pleased that officials did not warn him that kadarius toney was lined up offsides the way they have in the past about the call the normally mildmannered reid said its a bit embarrassing for the national football league for that to take place
i get great joy from seeing the refs treat the chiefs like every other team in the league
this was amazing to see about time the refs make the correct call and stop making these calls for mahomes
to be honest there was still over a minute and the bills had timeouts to score a td no guarantee that offsides call not being called would have meant a chiefs win
ironic patrick mahomes and chiefs fans realizing what every other team has to go through when facing the chiefs
i want to watch a football game not a every time kelsie catches the ball we have to cut to taylor swifts reaction
there is absolutely a major problem with officials tainting games with either questionable calls or non calls  and completely subjective  penalties which on some occasions determines the outcome of the game 

this wasnt one of them even stevie wonder can see toney was way offsides here
no amount of cursing and yelling can deflect from the fact that they lost mahomes just made himself look like a spoiled unsportsman like loser
as a chiefs fan im embarrassed and mortified by the behavoir mahomes displayed it shows how badly winning has gone to his head and how inflated his ego is that he cant handle losing with some ounch of dignity even if he thought someone else was in the wrong
watched them take 3 games from us in the past cuz of calls like these i still remember a game were mahomes got intercepted 4 times and they all came back theyve been spoiled for too long now they think they should let little mistakes like these slide
i love how patrick mahomes can throw a tantrum in front of the world but when i do it at work i need to grow up

special thanks to bigfrytv for his gameplay
hollyrexs clip httpswwwtwitchtvhollyrexclipbombastichyperalmonditsboshytimeyk9mhvw17bk6cm",2684,"steam has taken the game down  you can no longer buy it  apparently steam also holds money for 30 days  theyre also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played  so it looks like the developers jumped ship too early
luckily steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark this was too much of a scam even for steam
players and valve should put these guys in court
one thing i have learned over the years is there are people defending it means absolutely nothing in the world of video games    they love abuse
what people have to learn
never believe trailers 
never preoder anything
wait till the game is fully released
this is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on or rather orchastrated this game so people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
not to mention fntastic used volunteers in their development process they asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received participation certificates and free codes for the game every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it
the fact that the studio literally said shit happens is wow
level i gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isnt that easy
seconds later
also level random guy on reddit is recreating the game by himself  
i remember watching you when i was in middle school and you made airsoft videos im happy to see youre still at it man keep up the hard work 
imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be
keep an eye on the ranchers it was announced at tga a year ago and is going down the same route  even after a successful kickstarter
i have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens regardless of whether or not fntastic is actually in the red or not other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity expect to see people learning from the errors made by fntastic and performing scams better keep an eye out everyone do not buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear be cautious and stay safe and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
the frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam this was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release yet they bought it anyway its pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time
my biggest issue is i was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self but every video and trailer i watched i kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it but the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
i always follow the rule of if it looks and sounds too good to be true it probably is especially when they never show real in game footage
the gaming community should keep an eye on these people apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to eight points i feel theyll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
been appreciating your efforts since bf3  thank you for what you do
imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody i bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year thats making the game actually playable and improving on things too
i think this is a good thing long term for consumers if this doesnt get people to wise up and quit shelling out money for games without a good idea of what theyre getting something with a lot of thirdparty gameplay videos then theres no hope for video gamers",20,Gaming,1940000,PT10M53S,"['steam taken the game down you can longer buy apparently steam also hold money for day they are also allowing refund matter how long you have played look like the developer jumped ship too early', 'luckily steam accepting refund for player past the hour mark this too much scam even for steam', 'player and valve should put these guy court', 'one thing have learned over the year there are people defending mean absolutely nothing the world video game they love abuse', 'what people have learn', 'never believe trailer', 'never preoder anything', 'wait till the game fully released', 'this one those case where need make publicly visible who the scammer are that worked rather orchastrated this game people will know these scumbags decide just make new development team and try the same shit again', 'not_ mention fntastic used volunteer their development process they asked people help develop their game and exchange the volunteer received participation certificate and free code for the game every single stage development had the stench shady grifter all over', 'the fact that the studio literally said shit happens wow', 'level got give some credit the devs because what they put together not_ that easy', 'second later', 'also level random guy reddit recreating the game himself', 'remember watching you when middle school and you made airsoft video happy see you are still man keep the hard work', 'imagine they released the source code for the community use the foundation make the game supposed', 'keep eye the rancher announced tga year ago and going down the same route even after successful kickstarter', 'have feeling this will not_ the last time this happens regardless whether not_ fntastic actually the red not_ other people will see this possiblt opportunity expect see people learning from the error made fntastic and performing scam better keep eye out everyone not_ buy any new game from new and unknown developer until you see content creator review and give the all clear cautious and stay safe and hopefully this trend will die before take flight', 'the frustrating thing about this that consumer were told uncertain term practically all the gaming medium that this scam this made clear for them for pretty much year before release yet they bought anyway pretty hard imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that out there over that length time', 'biggest issue keeping eye this and planned get for self but every video and trailer watched kept sitting there feeling like this cash grab and not_ touch but the cinematic trailer they did looked great', 'always follow the rule look and sound too good true probably especially when they never show real game footage', 'the gaming community should keep eye these people apparently they have secondary studio already changed their name eight point feel they will continue their scam practice until they are demanded something the legal pathway thing', 'been appreciating your effort since bf3 thank you for what you', 'imagine legitimate developer like that guy joined make that parody bet they could have functional game out about month year that making the game actually playable and improving thing too', 'think this good thing long term for consumer this doe not_ get people wise and quit shelling out money for game without good idea what they are getting something with lot thirdparty gameplay video then there hope for video gamers']",653

 gaming lego fortnite",583,"extra tip carry 6 planks with you always you can 1 craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools including the grappler which makes it actually useful or 2 craft a bed once you get to the right town level which as already stated is good for respawns alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you
hiya guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold

regarding tip 12 with the grappler
thank you everyone for the comments i wasnt aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 
it may get patched soon though

really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code rugg in the item shop
thank you all so much for the support 
more lego fortnite videos will be coming later this week
major tips read this
something to keep in mind if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest it resets the grappler back to 10 uses it makes the grappler very work getting

another tip if you take the barrels of tnt found near old broken down buildings  and throw them into clusters of trees or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while im only at 3rd village lvl great video as always
for heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
if you keep a hearty charm on it can negate low temp or high temp damage you remain at full hp you get the temp hearts so long as your at the first layer of hotcold the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10 it usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used i also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return edit just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up
suggestion i explored my map a bit with nothing on me whenever i came across something interesting i would pick up small stones nearby make a marker and place it there that way i could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything then whenever im ready id gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that i can immediately go to
great tip with the grappler you dont have to break the chest put it in and take it out unfortunately not the same for tools
as of now when it comes to dying of starvation heat or cold there is a way to negate all of them with one item it allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though i took fire damage the entire time there is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if youre already full health and it regenerates itself very quickly meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation heat or cold itll regenerate it self this allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game especially in regards to those desert caves
more tips 1 instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools just craft a traditional counter under counters as it only costs 8 wood 

2 the grapplers uses can be refreshed just like your tools except its even easier you dont even need to break whatever chestcounter youve built just throw it in a storage thing take it out and its refreshed
thanks for the great tips

my tip is for people starting a new server in survival set up a different server with the same seed in sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town
i actually would suggest making a grappler it got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit 751
i dont know if anyone said this yet but you dont actually need cool headed charms for the desert if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you dont lose your temporary hearts and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back
you can find sand shells at the beachtropical coast areas access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations
craft the grappler it only sucks because it has 10 uses but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as theres so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect
heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers assign them to threading if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
i would say its for sure worth making the grappler just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land you can do the durability glitch w the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when youre fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
fun fact you can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out  aim at the highest point of a tree and itll work perfectly with the glider",20,Gaming,287000,PT9M16S,"['extra tip carry plank with you always you can craft chest anywhere repair all your tool including the grappler which make actually useful craft bed once you get the

nfl football americanfootball",1755,"stop awakenbeerus he is ruining football with his correct score leaks everyone share this comment so we ban him
gotta say as a giants fan we havent had a game this fun all season screw the tank i love to see my team win a good game
i went through so many different emotions this game being a giants fan im used to them losing a heartbreaker feels good for them to be on the other side of it
i love tommys dad that man is enjoying it his son is winning games for the new york football giants i just love that guy you can see the joy in his face nobody can take that from him 
one of tommy devitos best performances i have ever seen he was playing especially well against the packers defense today i hope he goes far in his career and continues to be a starter for the giants
that throwback of giants 
lmao that official getting knocked down then getting back up to signal touchdown was absolutely hilarious what a legend
i gotta say devito is really settling in with the offense

he seems much more confident in the pocket and also when scrambling and one thing i think we all found out tonight is the kid has a cannon for an arm 

even if dj is sidelined starting next year due to the achilles injury an entire offseason of him working with the primary group of receiversoffense may yield huge dividends for the giants

hes got the pocket presence to know when to bail out throw on the run and when needed he pulls it down and can run it very effectively 

this is going to be a very interesting offseason with the way this kid is playing you can see how the team on offense and defense is really responding to his energy and enthusiasm
i was at this game tonight and honestly i dont even care how the rest of this season goes that was an amazing game but very stressful holy and just an amazing night future is hopefully looking bright big blue 
4 weeks ago the giants were 28 under shurmur mcadoo and judge this team crawls up and dies for daboll they have gone out with a 3rd string qb won 3 straight with a chance at wildcard this is a sign of a great coach who has and is building something special
im not even a giants fan but i was all over on this game lol good game
i was all about the tank last month but then this kid tommy d came along and proved to me that playing for pride means so much havent had this much fun with a 58 record ever thanks big blue just keep fighting
titans fan here  how the heck were these two games so similar  crazy but fun  way to go gmen
huge respect for the giants from a cowboys fan
what a game for kayvon he had a strip and recovery on love a bat down at the line and constant qb pressure all just in the first half
congrats to the giants and their fans you earned that one and as a life long lions fan i say thank you
as a bears fan and a university of illinois alum way to go giants
i am a steeler fan but i was screaning my head off last night for the giants gutsy gutsy play scrambling by the young qb wow
what a clutch throw from devito and what a route ran by robinson to seal this win exciting ending
as a giants fan this now looks like a real team fighting together and cherishing for joint accomplishments and devito has a good arm and runs well he is also showing character and personality in a very tough environment  mamma mia",17,Sports,12300000,PT15M34S,"['stop awakenbeerus ruining football with his correct score leak everyone share this comment ban him', 'got say giant fan have not_ had game this fun all season screw the tank love see team win good game', 'went through many different emotion this game being giant fan used them losing heartbreaker feel good for them the other side', 'love tommys dad that man enjoying his son winning game for the new york football giant just love that guy you can see the joy his face nobody can take that from him', 'one tommy devitos best performance have ever seen playing especially well against the packer defense today hope far his career and continues starter for the giant', 'that throwback giant', 'lmao that official getting knocked down then getting back signal touchdown absolutely hilarious what legend', 'got say devito really settling with the offense', '', 'seems much more confident the pocket and also when scrambling and one thing think all found out tonight the kid cannon for arm', '', 'even sidelined starting next year due the achilles injury entire offseason him working with the primary group receiversoffense may yield huge dividend for the giant', '', 'got the pocket presence know when bail out throw the run and when needed pull down and can run very effectively', '', 'this going very interesting offseason with the way this kid playing you can see how the team offense and defense really responding his energy and enthusiasm', 'this game tonight and honestly not_ even care how the rest this season that amazing game but very stressful holy and just amazing night future hopefully looking bright big blue', 'week ago the giant were under shurmur mcadoo and judge this team crawl and for daboll they have gone out with 3rd string won straight with chance wildcard this sign great coach who and building something special', 'not_ even giant fan but all over this game lol good game', 'all about the tank last month but then this kid tommy came along and proved that playing for pride mean much have not_ had this much fun with record ever thanks big blue just keep fighting', 'titan fan here how the heck were these two game similar crazy but fun way gmen', 'huge respect for the giant from cowboy fan', 'what game for kayvon had strip and recovery love bat down the line and constant pressure all just the first half', 'congrats the giant and their fan you earned that one and life long lion fan say thank you', 'bear fan and university illinois alum way giant', 'steeler fan but screaning head off last night for the giant gutsy gutsy play scrambling the young wow', 'what clutch throw from devito and what route ran robinson seal this win exciting ending', 'giant fan this now look like real team fighting together and cherishing for joint accomplishment and devito good arm and run well also showing character and personality very tough environment mamma mia']",934

these guys really push the limit of whats possible
so happy to see youtube sponsoring this video you definitely deserve it so proud of how far youve come hope you take the time to appreciate what youve built now and then
i bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign and its absolutely amazing i used it for a few hours on the 4th of july and had no issues i didnt even have to refill it
oh my sweet celestia i love the logo design with aperture science

and id say its accurate because you guys are the embodiment of science is about why not

also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
fun personal experience for about a year i worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with class 10 clean rooms no perfume cologne makeup or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there and no skin exposed everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed and goggles that even had small air filters in them

james ive gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode this episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that ive been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today i sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team def bought a minisabre too
not a starwars fan more of a pirates of the caribbean guy but i loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic its an amazing project with an amazing team
i know no one will see this but i just want to say how amazing you guys are from your garage to the herc facility ive watched every video ive forgotten how long or at what amount of people i subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago but i want to thank you guys for everything youre doing pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers chemists physicists and rocket scientists keep up the amazing work cant wait for the we amputated this guys limbs and turned him into darth vader video but seriously you guys are awesome
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists been watching for a very long time around 4 years goodluck hacksmith
i am curious as to how theyll manage sabers clashing its been long theorizedand more or less confirmed in rebels that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact maybe theyll be able to utilize something to that regard
i love how casually he said lets play with liquid oxygen immediately after telling us how dangerous it is exactly what id expect from a sciengineeringinfotainment channel
how far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
while watched you earlier you were just making marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
now  the hacksmith is like an industry
too happy for you my man
keep going
hacksmith is doing something that even large companies wouldnt do big respect
the team at hacksmith industries actually do things that most people dont even think of its crazy 
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational maybe youre less stressed now or something but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends
i truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility you can see engineering past present and future in your labs

it really was iconic you could feel it watching it devin earned my respect
now everyone can see why he needed extra 5lbs dude looked like a zombie before drained af
looks so much healthier  energetic now
really impressed with what haney has done so far he looks unbeatable at 140 i really want to see him in there with teo and tank davis to see whos the best
devin fought his best fight that ive ever seen hes so accurate and quick with his shots he punished regis easily
devin haney is everything we wished adrian broner would be dude is on a path of greatness 
this is like the first perfect fight ive seen and devin is waaay nicer with his hands that i thought  he fought a perfect fight hes a problem i cant wait to see another of his fights if he fights like this
a masterclass even without a stoppage haney fought a perfect fight he was already that guy but the stock just went up even higher
remarkable performance by haney simply elite that night props to prograis for not quitting and not making any excuses after his loss haney was just on another level
absolutely amazing experience for my first time ever going to be a boxing event the bay showed out and so did haney
ill definitely admit that i always thought devin haney was boring but i know that he is a great boxer with superb technical ability and skills he definitely showed his worth last night and i didnt go in expecting a knockout but he completely outclassed the other man i didnt figure his power with translate well at a higher weight class but it seems like his shots had more oomf
it was one of the best performance i have seen in boxing this year  thank you haney for producing a helluva performance 
haneys accuracy is amazing hes so precise idk why anyone calls him boring
helluva performance happy i got to experience it live we are definitely entering the devin haney era
haney has improved a lot he seems more technical than normal taking care of every blow and every step that is the essence of boxing
barely any holding stayed in front displayed his power with a knock down and making regis stumble twice complete shut out without taking much damage masterclass performance
devin haney is everything we wished adrian broner would be dude is on a path of greatness
i expected haney to win a competitive fight with a few scares along the way but he completely dominated regis such a masterclass performance so much technical brillance in this fight by haney

lala is such a mind spin first she loves ariana then she dsnt then she goes hard for her at the reunion now shes resentful with friends like these who needs enemies
lala is jealous that her stuff with randall didnt get her what arianna is getting because of tom cheating
this is why its emmy nominated  omg thank you bravo for bringing back vpr soon 
they are living together because ariana did not take lisas advice to not allow tom to take a second mortgage out on their house for his bar
lala is a joke she used scandoval when it first happened to grab herself some attention by constantly dragging tom and being arianas friend since ariana suddenly got flooded with offers endorsements etc her tune has changed and she is a bitter betty because of all that attention she got the true lala once again comes out the jealously is off the charts and that is not a friend
lala thought she was going to be the damsel in distress and ariana hijacked her moment
wow
just wow
there should never be any question of whether or not theres a next season of vanderpump  it seems therell always be one
wow
and if this next season isnt as intriguing as it looks kudos to the editors
wowsounds like a lot of jealousy going oncongrats to ariana getting the job to play roxie hart in chicago on broadway hope i can get tickets
we all know lala only supported ariana because it got her likes and more screen time she understands the assignment of reality tv
sooooo ready for this  lol literally been binge watching the older seasons
tom is the one that doesnt want to sell the house he is the one that does not want to give up ownership ariana said so on chicks in the office
im glad the shows outside of housewives are getting their recognition they have always been lit its some of you that are late to the party
holy shit these people and the producers never fail to deliver looks awesome 
im still rooting for ariana to have to partner of over 10 years cheat on you with one of your close friends is a big deal and if companies want to give her deals than so be it good for her
not surprised scheana cheated everyone seems to forget she had an affair with brandis ex when him and brandi were still married shes disgusting
cant wait to see the new season
im so glad i see jax on the show i hope he comes back what happened to kristen wasnt she supposed to return this season
this is why its emmy nominated  omg thank you bravo for bringing back vpr soon

thedaybefore scam fntastic",1922,"the drama around this game was millions of times more entertaining than the game itself im almost sad its over seriously this is more like a crypto rug pull than a studio closure
this was a total social experiment and in some ways quite hilarious to prove a point that people will buy trash and be happy
the fact that hundreds of thousands of players actually bought such an obvious scam is the saddest part expect a lot more similar scams coming soon
most brain dead defenders of this game are like its not a scam you got a product  yes when i buy chevy camero and they give me a ford festiva im like well they did give me a product
these trash and overhyped companies need to face multimillion dollar lawsuits for false advertising
i get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games 
it honestly feels like everywhere i look there is a scam
this game was an ai generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
four days wow
that has to be some kind of record they didnt even try to hide it thats how confident they were that they could get away with it and they pretty much have
four days unbelievable
this is so blatantly a scam that im actually curious if this would qualify as criminal
like we all know that at least in america false advertising will never actually be prosecuted but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme also who wants to bet that those server issues at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund
as i said in other threads they met their contractual agreement to release a game they send their volunteers a boilerplate thank you email pay their investors and whatever is left theyll pocket without legal ramifications cant get money from a stone so by closing up shop theyre effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investorscreditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have 

they used the hype of tdb to generate a trickle of income through prop night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates

at this point steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue 

they pretty much have to at this point
its been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip  folks are claiming it was built using the 300 american city packs bundle which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95 of the ingame world would suggest is accurate its also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the 65 survival game kit v2 which is where the ingame inventory mechanics all come from
modern game made for modern gamers you all deserve each other

this was so obvious from day 1 too bad people still gave them money
watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly i cant fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming which is that i almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the actual product is instead of the dressedup version seen in trailers and marketing
personally i think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry these kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing
it would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release
imagine if you were one of those volunteers thinking they had a hand in something great and find out later the boss was scamming
this has been my favorite game for the last two years not because i was excited for it but because its just been a rollercoaster of bad pr and terrible decisions that led to what everyone knew from the beginning that this was a scam

instagram httpswwwinstagramcomofficialmumbo
twitter httpstwittercomthatmumbojumbo",1772,"as another comment pointed out you now need to have scar and grian try to watch this and build their own giant walking machines
mumbo you should make a machine that retracts fence posts
just in case youre being chased down by a warden 
i like mumbos concept of a basic loop and a jumbled loop however instead of jumbled loop i think it should be called a jumbo loop
if it is soo simple get grian and scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
it is kinda funny to see how closely mumbos three design rules parallel the design principles im learning as an engineering undergrad
ive never really gotten that into redstone so im genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along flying machines always mystified me but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes so much sense kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it
i love when we get mumbo videos like these  feels like the balance between theory and tutorial that makes it really easy for me personally to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards it doesnt ruin the magic of how you make them far from it it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand how cool your stuff is
yknow for tight timing things like this i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod  or recording in the 120 snapshots
that way youd have access to tick freeze and tick step which would make these explanations even better imo
this was actually really informative ive built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots thank you mumbo 
ps cool armadillo i love the eyebrows
you should use the new 1203 tick rate  tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video would probably help alot
what you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together when you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique a person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning and cool looking final product
the fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
reminds me of clockwork certainly gears are simple at their core but when combining them in large geartrains the complexity increases a lot of it is down to timing speed and torque 

fascinating
from now on every time mumbo states that something is simple we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement
ive only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle and ive already learned so much about these flying machines thank you so much mumbo
great video as always not sure if youve had a look at all the new snapshot features yet besides the crafting bench but the variable tick speed is really useful for showingseeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly
the carpet mod or even in vanilla since 1203 adds the tick command
this is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game and then go one tick at a time and see exactly whats happening and when
incredibly informative grian and scar can now fix docs giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 
i think this makes the whole process so much cooler even if in total its fairly simple
really cool to see the inner workings of how these seemingly complicated machines actually work",20,Gaming,9260000,PT17M52S,"['another comment pointed out you now need have scar and grian try watch this and build their own giant walking machine', 'mumbo you should make machine that retracts fence post', 'just case you are being chased down warden', 'like mumbos concept basic loop and jumbled loop however instead jumbled loop think should called jumbo loop', 'soo simple get grian and scar watch this video and watch them making flying machine', 'kind funny see how closely mumbos three design rule parallel the design principle learning engineering undergrad', 'have never really gotten that into redstone genuinely amazed that you explained such way that easy follow along flying machine always mystified but them being loop push and pull make much sense kind like caterpillar when you think about', 'love when get mumbo video like these feel like the balance between theory and tutorial that make really easy for personally synthesize understanding how the circuitry work while still having grand reference work towards doe not_ ruin the magic how you make them far from brings that magic within range knowledge that can actually understand how cool your stuff', 'yknow for tight timing thing like this would actually recommend getting either carpet mod recording the 120 snapshot', 'that way you would have access tick freeze and tick step which would make these explanation even better going', 'this actually really informative have built flying machine before and understood the basic idea but seeing broken down and explained like this really helped connect all the dot thank you mumbo', 'cool armadillo love the eyebrow', 'you should use the new 1203 tick rate tick step command decrease the tick and show slowmotion the flying machine the video would probably help alot', 'what you said the end about flying machine being smaller principle all put together applies many thing that you learn programming for example just bunch different component put together when you look from the top view you see all the smaller component but where becomes tricky putting them together make something cool and unique person could make those smaller component them self but would take lot more work and creativity make functioning and cool looking final product', 'the fact you can take something this crazy and simplify down succinct video honestly impressive more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build', 'reminds clockwork certainly gear are simple their core but when combining them large geartrain the complexity increase lot down timing speed and torque', '', 'fascinating', 'from now every time mumbo state that something simple need grian attempt and replicate verify that statement', 'have only watched far the fourth green rectangle and have already learned much about these flying machine thank you much mumbo', 'great video always not_ sure you have had look all the new snapshot feature yet besides the crafting bench but the variable tick speed really useful for showingseeing block movement sequence and other tricky redstone stuff which can hard figure out when happens quickly', 'the carpet mod even vanilla since 1203 add the tick command', 'this extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game and then one tick time and see exactly what happening and when', 'incredibly informative grian and scar can now fix doc giant tunnelbore just time for the end the season', 'think this make the whole process much cooler even total fairly simple', 'really cool see the inner working how these seemingly complicated machine actually work']",1072

i havent listened to her in years but shes grown so much were almost 2 years apart but i still feel like a proud mother gonna stream her albums
shes so good at it and the candle lighting portion with the words of reassurance the smirk and eye roll saying relax i am now convinced shes watched some asmr before
this is such a good asmr video she seems so natural at it got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough 
she needs to make her own asmr broo the crispiness of her whispers and binaural technique is so good
i am begging for whoever edits these videos to make the part where they do asmr with the w magazine longer it is so satisfying and one of my fav parts but always gets cut short

jacob is a phenomenal actor
lou vic and jake on one episode of game changer thats 100 going to be a banger
i love getting all worked up for a new dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
the way my heart caught in my throat when jacob started yelling at sam
love that bdg is doing a lot of stuff with dropout nowadays
i cant tell you how excited i am to see nathan on dropout again please please please more collabs with the drawfee hosts their gremlin energy is just what i need 
seeing nathan actually makes me a little emotional drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropoutch but im glad to see some drawfeedropout mixing is still possible
i saw jacob storm out and then the tv says do something great for the trailer i mean i had to pause the trailer because i started dying of laughter
well jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 
the fact that i was not scared at all jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of dropout
more vic more brennan meltdowns and more grant skin yes please also i love how upset a producer was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos 
bdg sungwon and nathan the already incredible cast is only getter better 
im so excited
im stoked as always and i just wanted to say that the that should cut good shows such respect for your audience and we hardly ever see that in reality tv nicely done yall
bdg and sungwon graduating from make some noise to game changer proper plus caldwell and nathan making their game changer debuts oh yeah this is gonna be a good season
love how the marketingthroughline of this series keeps getting slightly more horrorthriller with each season
jesus jacobs acting legitimately got me there for a second
im so relieved jacob wasnt actually upset i teared up a bit lol
im so excited for nathan drawfee hopefully this will lead to more drawfeedropout crossovers in the future i need some more snilk and drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
im so excited to see nathan as a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan im happy to see you folks doing stuff together even after drawfee went independent i hoped thered be some crossovers still and im not disappointed i see why you didnt have karina shes too powerful although shed rock in a yugioh episode of um actually

what is really sad is how freaking nonchalant they are about breaking into so many cars and they have routes
i absolutely love how thorough and all out this guy goes  he seems like he could have been a handful as a teenager
i like how mark is focused on expressing how the spray is harmless even though i dont think anyone would complain even if he put some mustard gas or cs in there
you have to keep doing this series the instant karma is awesome and youre helping to deter people hopefully from taking stuff that isnt theirs
mark is a master storyteller the series must go on

honestly bethesda owes modders millions for fixing their games all these years
quick update had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the house building song from rdr2 all i basically say is that the bounty system in starfield is even worse than rdr2 and being a pirate is so discouraged its borderline impossible anyways thanks so much for watching this video  i was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it  big ups to the whole island

an amazing and high quality video as always jakey i seriously appreciate you mentioning how good skyrims ost is since thats like the king of music for me fyi the audio cuts out at 2948  3005 and 3015  3023
really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing the flow the script the scene choices the cutaway timing all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same new but nostalgic this is a huge development in the nakeyjakey career path maybe getting a bit wiser  cant wait to see a new video in like 3 years
1655 as a parent of a toddler seeing this ms rachel spoof sent me it was really well done and to be clear we absolutely adore ms rachel in my house
for a year before starfields launch my manager couldnt stop talking about it he would go on and on about how it was everything hes ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched

last week he came poked his head out from the other room and asked what was the name of that space game we used to play dude couldnt even remember the name of it anymore now granted my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid his favorite movie of all time is battlefield earth i know but i still feel like this means something
that clip of todd howard saying how he told everyone hed make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
dear jacob

another fantastic video as always i really liked the style of cinematography in this one it was obviously different than your usual style but thats not a bad thing by any means it felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend 

ive been following your content since 2017  went all the way through high school and am starting college now always looking forward to the next jarby video thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us and enjoy the holidays
an entire town wanting you dead in skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly but the idea that starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what youve done is the funniest thing ive heard all week
i think the signs were there a long time agoi played es4 oblivion extensivelywasnt perfect but i still had a lot of fun with itwhen skyrim came out i was hyped but i never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after i got it it was exceptionally underwhelming i still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line eg i always preferred dark brotherhood and thieves guild storyline over fighting dragons then something has gone terribly wrong
something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every unexplored frontier planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it im not exploring and finding something new im just playing tourist it would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot 35
thank you for finally putting into words why i just could not get into starfield i am a huge bethesda fan  i have been playing skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes along with the fallout games i wanted to love starfield so much but after a few hours i just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there i also think youre one of the few people who shares my opinion on fallout 3s atmosphere vs new vegas so i appreciate the nod to that as well
starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isnt fun and theres like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn
3333 funny thing about the item vacuum in jail the items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower early game its actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared lock pick your stuff back then be on your way

US,sevVQaD_e0I,this minecraft base is not good actually,kenadian the catboy,2023-12-11T13:00:46Z,,424559,29368,"why are we still making most secure minecraft base videos in 2023
checks view count
oh



huge credit to avatardotpng for making 90 of this base with help from maximumg9 chessjames dwinkley calamitas wato and me

music
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi3as7woijds
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6652bghhh78",1710,"this is like watching a kids sandcastle being obliterated by 3kg of high explosive while the detonator is roasting the kid lmao
there is one thing all these youtubers should know

the only safe house in minecraft is a hidden one
mumbo jumbo
oh boy this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these 
yeah these safest bases are usually pathetically easy to enter their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create easy defenses that are redundant and pointless serving to introduce more vulnerability
i thought this base was really secure but then i had a very good idea i used f5 see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and i was able to see that this base was insecure
i knew he would debunk it eventually while watching i was like bro kenadian is going to destroy this lol
lesson learned next time you want to build a base watch out for kenadians in the wild
yer the base is kinda dumb it only works if you obey very specific rules and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare

all these safest bases just dont work without other mods commands datapacks etc to add additional mechanics

still thanks for showing just how easy it is
when kenadian is bored he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things
1 im glad carvs was a good sport about this its always nice to see someone who can take a joke
2 i was thinking the exact same things when i was watching his video i was like couldnt someone just fly or build through this whole thing this design seems super exploitable
someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools damn this is a safe base
kenadian beating it without taking damage hold my beer
231 322 i love the little detail of while hes explaining why this base is actually secure hes just chilling in the middle of the danger zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
this safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremodenew to minecraft
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
i looked at this base and thought it was very secure but then i had a very good idea  i used blocks see using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armorpotions simple
the fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point mad respect
is easier to destroy than to create no base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base
i was already impressed but the half a heart challenge was the cherry on top for me well done

as an avid thomas fan i cannot appreciate enough the immense amount of work your team did to bring us back the old thomas style i remember watching as a kid bravo and well done
the sheer amount of work that went into doing that last animation makes me once again feel amazed at the commitment of the team to produce highquality work week after week i love this
as a railway worker in the us thank you for this absolutely well done story and bringing more attention to how far our industry is falling
thank you john for bringing this horrible deregulation to light we are a corporatocracy and its got to stop
freight conductor here thank you for highlighting corporate greeds utter destruction of this once great jobindustry the railroads do everything they can to keep things in house and out of the public eye please people with all the support for striking unions remember to support rail workers should we decide to walk out
i am a railroad worker and this episode is spot on great episode thanks for getting the word out
matt berry provided some absolutely killer narration for the beautiful end animation well done lazlo cravensworth
my dad was a conductor for decades he nearly had a his body ripped apart from a derailment thank you for your coverage on this
as a former railroad worker thank you so much for shedding light on this topic genuinely
i worked for the forest service for a summer and regularly had to drive over railroad tracks that had no lights or stop signs or gates the rule for those of us who had to cross them was to stop and make sure it was clear before crossing a big wig had called about the lack of safety measures at that spot  and was told that no improvements would be made until a certain number of accidents cars vs trains happened  
i was hoping youd also talk about how freight trains have made it impossible to have reliable passenger rail service in the us because they own all the track
that henry skit at the end was a beautiful piece of art and i am so damn glad they got matt berry for it
also 1m for anyone that manages to put that into childrens programming
spot on  seriously spot on  my husband worked for bnsf for 41 years and is still so terrified they will remove his retirement he would flip out if he knew i made a comment  i have been saying the safety thing was bullshit for decades but i had no idea it had become policy  what a crock  what wasnt mentioned in your piece though is that one of the other ways they really save money is to ignore the track itself and miles and miles of it is in such a state of disrepair it is becoming increasingly worrisome  couple that with the extreme weather conditions and we will see lots more derailments happening  also at one point there was a rule that the train could not block a highway for too long so they would have to split the train apart and open up the crossing while they wait  this only happened if it was a state highway or major thoroughfare though so trains in small towns that have an overpass now will sit for hours  thanks for tackling this issue
this show should get an award for that animation sequence at the end the story telling was 
the crew on this show deserves their flowers  the bit at the end was brilliant  much like the others that are done on here  i really appreciate watching this show
john and his team never disappoint thank you
loved henry at the end too
the end bit on this was phenomenal hats off to the builders for really putting in the effort it shows
i lived in a small town in florida crescent city the local poor people thought that the nice gravel under the tracks would make nice driveways so they took buckets of it each night until the rails were undermined to the point where a train derailed fortunately there was no dangerous cargo just cars full of people no one died but there were many injuries

richeisenshow nfl kansascitychiefs",4098,"maybe the officiating has been awful this year but this isnt an example of bad officiating  the referee did his job correctly
throwing the penalty flag without knowing what happens next is the most fair thing the ref can do in that situation and mahomes berating a ref because his team is struggling instead of holding his teammate accountable for the lack of discipline is crazy
the fact that he was clearly offsides but yet the media wants to have the convo should it have been called  especially rich being an nfl network employee  is mind boggling to me  because what this does is opens pandoras box of the league being rigged and choosing who they want to win by calling or not calling penalties
the game didnt end with a bad call it ended with three incomplete passes
kadarius actually looked at where the ball was and still lined up offsides he deserves it
i dont remember patrick mahomes complaining about all the defensive penalties called against kc opponents late in games during the playoffs past couple years  diva
the chiefs benefit from so many calls its nice to finally see  it balancing out a bit
mahomes had absolutely no problem with the bad unnecessary roughness late hit on the sideline last week
whether the penalty impacted the play is irrelevant a couple weeks ago the broncos missed field goal got called back because of 12 men on the field no shot that extra man impacted the field goal but you didnt see allen and mcdermott crying to the refs about making that call in such a critical moment its an objective call the chiefs need to take some accountability
rich just like the other mahomes lovers colin nick and the whole cast good morning football are like its mahomes dont throw penalties against them inside the 2 min warning  
offsides is like the most objective penalty in football you can go on about controversial pass interference calls because thats a bit more subjective of a call but offsides is about as clear as you can get
all that frustration from mahomes and reid needs to directed at tony not the officials  it was a helluva play but the guy that scored also committed an obvious foul
the most damning thing is that the penalty didnt end the game mahomes had multiple downs left to do something and he didnt thats what ended the game
i think rich misunderstood the refs answer to the pool reporter he said if the wr asked for advice hed give it insinuating toney didnt check first if he was barely offside they may choose to just warn them after the play but it was so egregious and there was no check so there was no way they could look the other way
didnt the chiefs win a couple of games earlier this year due to last minute officiating calls that were phantom calls im pretty sure one was with the jets
to make sure that there arent any misunderstandings the officials should stop letting the receivers know if they are lined up offsides or not
last week chiefs got a bad call on pi  they also benefitted from a bogus calls  roughing on qb no 10 second runoff on the reversal and another clock stoppage when receiver was going backwards and did not go out of bounds
rich brings back all the good espn memories    way to stay the same as you used to be
we had a kid a friend of mine in high school during a scrimmage game forget to put his mouth piece in before the snap  the ball is snapped a great play gaining many yards takes place all to be called back because my friend inadvertently didnt put in his mouth piece  have you ever seen a play in the pro game called back because of an equipment malfunction  game winning touchdown called back because tom brady threw a touchdown pass with his shirt tail hanging out  i havent  but until the chiefs game i had never seen an offside on the offense  then i saw it again sunday night when the cowboys did it against the eagles  it was mentioned that like a few hours before that this penalty has all the commonality of two men wearing the same jersey number at the same time on the field as was the case in a boise state game a couple years ago  but its a written rule  jay walking is a written traffic offense that not many if any policeman has ever enforced  but its a written rule  its in the script  it isnt the referees job to police the formations  one article i read asked the question was a warning in order  a warning  hey kadarius youre offside get you butt back over on your side  ok  hey bob hey pete you two are moving at the same time you cant do that  hey bill quit wiggling ill have to call you for a false start  its the players job to police themselves on the field and their coaches jobs to make sure they are lined up where they should be  not the ref side judge back judge or judge judy  when you look at the still photo kadarius is practically shaking hands with the defensive player in front of him  the flag was thrown the moment the ball was snapped not after the touchdown ceremony had been completed  patrick and andy had every right to be upset  the same way a person caught red handed breaking into a house has the right to complain while hes being cuffed

vgg cadillac",9285,"i worked for cadillac as a district service manager when that car was introduced in prerelease service meetings it was wellknown from the very beginning that the 864 was planned to be a oneyearonly engine the big problem was the early delco electronics the map sensor was calibrated with tooclose tolerances if the engine hicupped backfired it would shut down there was no repair except to replace the map sensor the bigger problem was replacement stock was the exact same part and it took gm a while before an updated unit could be supplied dealers would disconnect the 864 feature running it as an 8cyl only the press had a field day i inspected a limo in west palm beach florida that the owner wanted all the interior chrome replaced someone had discharged a tear gas device inside the car that caused the damage  the interior chrome pieces came from different suppliers so it was impossible for all of it to be defective and i denied the claim it turned out the limo was owned by the owner of the newspaper the national inquirer famous for stories like i got pregnant by an alien etc they went on a huge hate campaign smearing the vehicle which only threw fuel on the fire those were tough times to be a cadillac district service manager
as a 35 year mechanic i want to say that i admire derek for messing with that aggravating thing respect
the brake drum has traveled farther than the vehicle itself man that was classic
god i love me an old school caddy
the cadillac of despair what a test of wits and perseverance i felt for you through all of it while still bursting into laughter a number of times what an extraordinary episode thanks derek for actually putting this one out 
oh man that brake drum divorcing itself from the vehicle was epic it totally went with the whole project my experience with tbi dumping fuel was the coolant temp sensor 2 wire funny enough the computer relied on coolant temp for fuel mapping could be bad injectors maybe great video laughed a lot
this revival will be a top favorite now just for the amount of genuine laughs as things kept progressively happening the brake drum and the flame out of the  tbi  youre the best man thank you for what you do
what a fight i think this is a great candidate for a junkyard ls or a good old 350
way to keep on fighting through i wouldve thrown in the towel way earlier
i dont think gm tbi fuel injection from the 80s worked like a modern ecu it was a while ago but i think they start in open loop mode with a fixed map on temperature manifold pressure and throttle position once it warms up it switches to closed loop mode where it mostly uses the o2 sensor i bet when it was running good it was because it was in closed loop mode getting it to run long enough to switch to closed loop looked difficult though
id love to see round 2 there are several struggles you had that ive learned from
appreciate the perseverance i would really like to see this thing run and drive even if it means a carb swap or something else along those lines i just dont think this should be how it ends with this rig
man you really worked for every bit of that one

thanks for everything you do
awesome as usual very interesting how the critters migrated the under hood insulation to the exhaust system
even though she didnt drive home this was still a fantastic episode the patience perseverance and diagnostic progression you show is truly impressive shout out to oreilly for the support absolutely loved the brake drums desire to get back on the road
we loved this episode my wife cracked up when the brake drum shot across the shop you cant let this thing beat you toss a modern efi system on it and make it a super nice take momma out to dinner rig
i definitely want to see a carburetor swap and a general engine bay cleanup where you get rid of as many hoses and wires as possible
this has to be one of my favorite episodesthe runaway brake drum fleeing the scene and then the fire in the holeabsolutely hilarious  i laughed so hard my dogs starting barking at me
hell of an effort i dont think ive seen you slither the floor that much ever the launch of the drum was classic my brotherinlaw and some other students at an agriculture engineering school in mo began the design on this engine in the 70s for an ag engine not a passenger car the story goes that the college sold the idea to gm and they took it and proceeded to wreck it 
great effort
im only about half way through the video so far but man does it make me feel good watching you go through many of the struggles i go through on my cadillac  it makes me feel so much more normal lol
derek what a great episode i was really hoping you would get this thing going but props to you for showing that everything does not always go as planned and showing that sometimes even when we do our best we still fail but it is best to learn from this experience so what would i like to see done with his vehicle well i would like to see it moving down to the road the 368 cadillac is a great engine and very durable and reliable as long as it doesnt have this particular fuel delivery system also it is the last of the cadillac v8 so first thing and youve already done this disconnect the cylinder deactivation as most cadillac dealers did and let it run as a v8 secondly remove all of the fuel injection paraphernalia from 1981 and replace it with some type of holley fuel injection system and then make sure its ship shape and maybe give it away i mean i would would like to own of these if it had a reliable fuel delivery system just my two cents thanks again for another great video",2,Autos

if you want to keep the eggs and want to move them out of the freezer you can also encase them in resin as a memento of her laying eggs without running the risk of accidentally breaking them in the freezer or having them explode cause normal eggs can explode in the freezer and idk if it would be harder or easier to explode tiny eggs like that
if you go back and watch aris first birthday theres a great segment that goes along the lines of  i dont know aris gender the only way to really know is a dna test unless its too late and you already have eggs everywhere
for anyone wondering there are two types of birds nesting and nonnesting a nesting birds babies are called nestlings and when first hatched are super fragile needs constant food cannot walk or fly is completely featherless and takes longer to mature a nonnesting birds babies are just called chicks and when first hatched can walk dont need constant food cannot fly and has a fuzzy coat that keeps them warm independantly of their mother

chickens turkeys quail pheasants ducks geese etc all give birth to chicks which is why you may be thinking that baby birds are easy to care for they kinda just figure out life on their own nestling birds need special equipment foods and sometimes medicines to be raised by humans you need to feed them every 46 hours with a syringe keep them warm and keep them hydrated which is harder to do when they are kept warm for the duration of their infancy you basically have to nap instead of sleep or have a second person assist you as you both plan your sleep schedules to do a 1212 shift you need to take care of them for something or rather every 3 hours on the hour raising a bird seems really cool but dont raise a nestling unless you know everything about the species you are trying to raise
tip if you want to know if the eggs are fertilized or not just put a flashlight over them and look if there is any red spots over the yellow gold
jaiden i hope they get along
the birds bubble gum electric
as a female cockatiel owner egg binding is a scary concept ive been told calcium supplements and a vet visit to remove any stuck eggs is fine but still so sols cage has no possible nesting spots and when shes out of it shes always with me so its all good  

sol is such a personable sweetheart i adore her she demands head scritches from everyone including the vet lol and hates hates hates raisins like will literally throw them out of her feed hates them learned that the first time when i was hand feeding her bits of her feed and she bounced it off my knee xd

as for the sawdust comment i can 100 believe that sol had a toy meant for the parakeets my twin and i used to have before they passed but never ended up giving it to and she adored it she cronched that thing like cookie wafer  sounded like it too anyway the moment it stopped being an out of cage toy and i hung it up inside said cage it got absolutely demolished very quickly and there was just woodchips everywhere so many woodchips i swear the thing should not have produced that many but it did

i adore birds theyre my favorite kind of pet but i am very consciously aware that a cockatiel is my best match and not say a conure or heaven forbid an actual parrot and thats okay also jaiden is 110 correct raising baby birds is a nightmare i wouldve done the same thing as would many other bird owners google it if you dont believe us back on topic though while in my opinion birds make for the best kind of pet you need to take into account whether or not you are able to give them the time and attention they need know what you can and cannot do and if you cant thats okay know your limits but dont get a bird if you cant take care of it properly itll just end in tears 

so to sum it up egg binding is scary sol is the best sorry not sorry ari and tofu bird sawdust is real raising baby birds is a nightmare and birds make for the best pets if and only if youre able to meet their needs and theres nothing wrong with you if you cant just dont get a bird if so
pray for jaden that she doesnt lose her mind from taking care of lots of birds
as an er vet who sees birds i agree with 100 of your sentiments about bird ownership at the end loved the video very humorous but also spreading the truth about bird ownership
my friend had three parakeets in the past the mother died naturally and then the daughter unalived her father glad to see tofu and ari are well 
i love jaidens pet videos about her feathered babies hopefully she makes one for tostada the kitty cat one day too
015 i just wanna mention how nice this depiction of this fanbase is all just calmly cheering for ari i love this depiction because fans of any media these days sometimes are portrayed as rabidly obsessed creatures with no sense of reason and it hurts when youre part of that fanbase it really shows the maturity of her team and of jaidens fans i commend you all this really is such a lovely mature and respectful community
as a long time fan this is crazy to watch never would i have thought ari would become a dad or a mom
as a cat owner of the most gremlin crazy cats i laughed so hard at this video pet owners of the pets who destroy things but who you love dearly truly understand where youre coming from 
as a green cheek conure owner piccolo and bansuri are some of the best things that ever happened to me i regret nothing and simultaneously theyre the bane of my existence

redfalcon gaming mario",474,"wubbas fate is still tragic but congrats to the winner what a welldeserved victory
that was a masterpiece a total rollercoaster of emotions even the man with no tear ducts that cant cry shed tears for our fallen warriors we love you hoppy and rip metal mario the original under dog
this one is special to us i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible 
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops that was a wild vid
even though hoppy cat won congrats to medal mario for being the underdog
this video is the true definition of tragic i rooted for metal mario the whole way through but he came just short but congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory
why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream cant wait for the faster mario kart to become a vid 
but how far can the hoppycat go
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did he deserved first he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection even if metal mario only got second he had to work for it im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it werent for that level and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
mods are already so crazy im so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds
the fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasnt possible is impressive itself
this is crazy i havent seen the end yet but this is gonna be interesting every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting
as a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win
you should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go and i already know hell be going to world 4 at least since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels i was rooting for them and am so happy they won
id love to see hoppycat beat the game always love the little enemies
great video so many twists and turns as a long time red falcon fan i must say im loving these new videos and editing style
wonder how far the wubba wouldve made it if water levels werent required i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game
fantastic video love the concept execution and editing

man seeing these talented individuals make such wonderful art out of the craziest things makes me wish i could do the same thing xd

davids piece was just so beautiful for being made out of melted chocolate like dayum i honestly loved mackenzies piece as well it was just so detailed and amazing looking and i feel like if she wasnt punished so much she wouldve definitely had enough time to make a full body to attach to the head to make it look even more epic than it already did and it seriously wouldve been a hard decision and a super close win i honestly really loved michelles piece it was just super adorable and honestly deserved top 3 3
davids painting is amazing  love his style  michelles squid and mackenzies dino skeleton was really good and realistic

as a madrid fan im not surprised at all they have played and given all their might to that red and white shirt and it would be a literal honor to the league if they pull a leicester city type of thing at the end of the season remarkable from girona 
girona and their coach michael sanchez wasnt just there to beat barcelona its as if he was also making an audition to be barcelonas coach in the future

he outcoached xavi and all his substitutes made impacts to put the game away 

girona have scored the most goals in la liga while being top of the league
girona ability to hold and retain possession was well executed rarely are teams able to keep possession against barcelona but they were playing and passing through the barca press almost with ease i saw they also changed their system a bit from their usual one so they clearly trained and practiced for this occasion all week and it paid dividends
wow girona is for real what a statement they seem to have a well balanced team i hope for them continued success
as a real madrid fan i would not be mad if girona won the league
barca defense is all over the placeshocking performance
i think a new style of football is on the rise to counter the high press possession hungry teams teams like barcelona overcommit their midfielders and fullbacks managers used to set up low block and counter basically allowing barcelona to toss the ball around in the middle third ive seen some progressions that started with taking away pivots then passing lanes to the pivots that kept teams like barcelona at their own side of the middle third more than close to the final third i feel like teams are now exposing the middle third by dropping back enough win the ball then quickly move the ball in the open spaces in the middle third then on to the final third they constantly put pressure the cbs since teams like barcelona will have every midfielders pushed up the field teams like girona are taking advantage of the empty middle third and stressing tf out of the cb by using their high backline against them
its time we fans and the board start questioning xavi this isnt the first time he fails with this team when it really matters
girona are really impressive michael sanchez made very good subs and their style of play is impressive i really hope they can last the full season for an exciting title race
well done to girona as a barca fan i knew this wasnt easy their attacking efficiency is absolutely amazing and i think they scored in every single game since october i have complete faith we will improve and come back much stronger in the meantime welcome to the top of the table
hopefully girona actually tend to play like this for a while la liga could really use exciting teams like them
pure unbelievable performance by girona
girona not only beat barca they looked so comfortable doing it
barca fan its been tough lately but im loyal and i gotta say i hope girona take the championship this season not only is it good for the league but they deserve to win it for the game theyre playing and heart theyre showing lets just focus on the championship league for now
this is the greatest moment in la liga in the last 10 years many young football viewers have no idea the consequence of this and how important this is for spanish football
even if girona had only won 10 the way they dominated barcelona was impressive
girona showing proper teamwork hardwork and running your socks off is what it takes brilliant display and deserve to be top of the league reminds me of leicester city when they won a few years back
the way girona is passing the ball around barcelona especially inside the box is class
i said this when the season began xavi needs to go also credit where credit is due girona looking mighty impressive city group has done wonders for that club lets see if this performance is there to stay or if its just a wonder season kinda run",17,Sports,3450000,PT14M26S,"['man maybe xavi not_ the right man for the job barca not_ have bad player but consistently fails motivate the team into important game with the right attitude', 'madrid fan not_ surprised all they have played and given all their might that red and white shirt and would literal honor the league they pull leicester city type thing the end the season remarkable from girona', 'girona and their coach michael sanchez not_ just there beat barcelona also making audition barcelona coach the future', '', 'outcoached xavi and all his substitute made impact put the game away', '', 'girona have scored the most goal liga while being top the league', 'girona ability hold and retain possession well executed rarely are team able keep possession against barcelona but they were playing and passing through the barca press almost with ease saw they also changed their system bit from their usual one they clearly trained and practiced for this occasion all week and paid dividend', 'wow girona for real what statement they seem have well balanced team hope for them continued success', 'real madrid fan would not_ mad girona won the league', 'barca defense all over the placeshocking performance', 'think new style football the rise counter the high press possession hungry team team like barcelona overcommit their midfielders and fullback manager used set low block and counter basically allowing barcelona toss the ball around the middle third have seen some progression that started with taking away pivot then passing lane the pivot that kept team like barcelona their own side the middle third more than close the final third feel like team are now exposing the middle third dropping back enough win the ball then quickly move the ball the open space the middle third then the final third they constantly put pressure the cbs since team like barcelona will have every midfielders pushed the field team like girona are taking advantage the empty middle third and stressing out the using their high backline against them', 'time fan and the board start questioning xavi this not_ the first time fails with this team when really matter', 'girona are really impressive michael sanchez made very good sub and their style play impressive really hope they can last the full season for exciting title race', 'well done girona barca fan knew this not_ easy their attacking efficiency absolutely amazing and think they scored every single game since october have complete faith will improve and come back much stronger the meantime welcome the top the table', 'hopefully girona actually tend play like this for while liga could really use exciting team like them', 'pure unbelievable performance girona', 'girona not_ only beat barca they looked comfortable doing', 'barca fan been tough lately but loyal and got say hope girona take the championship this season not_ only good for the league but they deserve win for the game they are playing and heart they are showing let just focus the championship league for now', 'this the greatest moment liga the last year many young football viewer have idea the consequence this and how important this for spanish football', 'even girona had only won the way they dominated barcelona impressive', 'girona showing proper teamwork hardwork and running your sock off what take brilliant display and deserve top the league reminds leicester city when they won few year back', 'the way girona passing the ball around barcelona especially inside the box class', 'said this when the season began xavi need also credit where credit due girona looking mighty impressive city group done wonder for that club let see this performance there stay just wonder season kind run']",866

surprised by the 20 point win and aubrey making 4 45 yard field goals giving dan bailey a run for his money as my favorite cowboys kicker
that long dallas field goal had the poweraccuracy to travel  70 yards wow
aubrey is amazing solved the cowboys kicking game completely
love how aubrey comes off the soccer pitch onto the football field and just cant seem to miss even his 59 60 yard field goals look like a walk in the park to him
as an eagles fan ggs to dallas they played extremely well and deserved the win i think the eagles need to change their strategy a bit but yeah eaglescowboys games are always fun to watch regardless the results
on top of everything else im really happy with the running game i saw too pollard and dowdle deserve a lot of credit
my first cowboy game ever was a win ill never forget this game everyone in the stands including myself yelling here we go was awesome
stephon gilmore is him what an absolute gem of a game from him
one of the most complete cowboys teams ever
between this game and the 49ers its safe to say that the eagles head coach has been considerably humbled the cowboys are looking like a real sb contender this year well see
its a good time to be a cowboys fan i think theyve really improved this season especially their wrs and defense carrying the game
went to this game energy was insane stadium was unreal and came out with a dub 
that tackle by gilmore at 1000 mark was beautiful to watch  also aubrey is a freak of nature
love seeing these power plays by tes even when theyre not going for a big gain still seeing some of the best blocks off the edge for ferguson ive ever seen in nfl history dude is a young jason witten
man i cried watching this game my son went to the christmas eve game last year  it was his very first nfl game and unfortunately his last he passed away christmas morning and ive been devastated ever since i am grateful that his last day on this planet was filled with excitement and joy thank you to dak and the cowboys for giving him that i will root for them for my son michael forever18
my favorite part is when tirico said with the game changing play didnt change a thing gooooo cowboys
this was more than a win for dallas this was to show the fans we still got it
this game is exactly what i was hoping to see the cowboys pound the eagles into the turf with overwhelming and devastating force

i honestly didnt realize just how dumb water witches looked until this video i didnt realize it was so blatantly made up
great video  the hotel is  looking really good  the water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist
its crazy to watch how much progress youve made since 2020 the town looks great
we love your videos brent they dont all have to be well planned like they all are you could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same thanks for being a content creator
im not an expert hiker or trail blazer but i think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail  it would be safer for anyone that wants to see that beautiful view of the valley  keep up the fantastic work brent  im hoping to be able to get to cerro gordo within the next couple of years  till then i look forward to more and more video updates
brent you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees leaving stone cairns on a route for others to follow looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in oz happy festive season mate
theres nothing i want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
theres something magical about the sierras i was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at lake sabrina you can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning the calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless
yes dan is awesome love his channel so glad hes made an appearance
bravo brent  im so proud to have watched your first episodes of ghost town living way back in 2020  i never stopped  best channel on you tube  it never gets old  thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride  i will get to cerro gordo one day and visit  congratulations on a great month and merry christmas
hey brent what you are doing at cerro gordo is just simply amazing i am  a retired water treatment production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and i am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history  thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos i am envious of your accomplishments
cerro gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately but id love to visit if i had the chance your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from its amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on
ive been watching since before the hotel burnt down and im so glad that its being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
brent your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch i never miss an episode i would love to visit one day i am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun  maybe one day i could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully i can visit in the near future cheers
brett you are truly an inspiration to me and im sure many others i admire your commitment to youre amazing project that you have taken upon yourself with the help of others you have outstanding perseverance
it pleases me to preorder your book i now feel like i am just a small part of your world i hope to visit and meet you someday
   it is amazing that you have found your place in this world and even more amazing that you are preserving history
blessings to you and your passions
i think hiking trails are a great idea that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too especially once you get a good supply of water on tap then the town could serve as a base camp so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies
wow what an incredible journey exploring an abandoned ghost town your determination and enthusiasm for discovering hidden treasures like gold and water are truly inspiring the way you uncover the history and explore the nooks and crannies of these forgotten places is both fascinating and captivating keep up the amazing work and looking forward to more thrilling adventures like this one and

fnaf fnafmovie chuckecheese fivenightsatfreddys fnaflore chuckecheeseplaytime chuckecheeses chuckycheese pizza theory foodtheory matpat filmtheory gametheory",2554,"i worked at chuck e cheese as a manager for 2 years and it was a daily question where is the animatronics is it true kids got stuffed in them do you know fnaf
for those wondering scott said he wouldnt make fnaf a real thing as a park restaurant or anything like that because hes scared someone would make the games real to become famous or something
you know fnaf has messed you up when matpat tells the story of a real guy and you treat it like a lore theory
i think the main mistake a lot of family friendly companies are making is that they put way too much focus on being unoffensive to the parents theyre so careful not to give the parents any reason to not bring their kids to their restaurants that they completely neglect to give the kids any reason to want to go in the first place would a fnaf event at chuck e cheese upset some parents sure but kids would be begging to go check it out and that would drum up so much more business than theyd potentially lose
remember that chuck e cheese was the actual main reason why fnaf happened in the first place so i think the best thing charles entertainment could do is not only collaborate chuck e cheese with fnaf but also possibly make a trip down memory lane to fnafs history and most chuck e cheeses history as well
as a kid in the 90s the chuck e cheese animatronics were barely working and they were scary to me timeskip to now and as someone who loves fnaf i would love to see a collab between fnaf and chuck e cheese heck im sure the kids going to chuck e cheese love fnaf
as someone who works at a main event as a technician i can attest to the fact that maintanence and repair of attractions takes a lot of money especially depending on what broke if its a lane generally the parts are gonna be expensive due to the wear and tear they need to endure and how big they are and with how pricey bowling is they get paid for on that alone as bowling next to dining and scheduled events are the big money makers games on the other hand have to pay for themselves due to their high initial cost and make their revenue based on who plays them throughout the day via game cards or tokens if a part on a game breaks down the cost of the part comes from how much it makes so if a coin pusher breaks a motor and the motor is 130 and the game makes 1000 a week than its an easy buy if a shooter game has its gun break down and the gun is 900 but the game makes 500 a week its a lot harder to justify keeping the game especially if its an old one another example would be if te game promotes a gimmick that contributes nothing to gameplay and is purely funcosmetic if thst breaks down and te revenue the game brings in isnt enough to justify fixing the gimmick but the game works regardless than it can be left operable just without that flashing light more so if the gimmick continuously breaks i imagine with big animatronic characters this kind of logistics is applied even more so as they are an attraction but dont necessarily bring in their own revenue theyre just for show like a tv and rely on what the resturant earns to keep their upkeep in check
the fact matpat still remembers fnacfive nights at candy and mentions it is amazing
its actually interesting that chuck e cheese was starting to file for bankruptcy similar to how fnaf kind of did it mostly in the first game this possibly states that chuck e cheese is now officially fnaf but in real time
i think the problem they want to avoid is if they lean too heavily into the fnaf side then some psycho might attempt to recreate the games irl thats exactly why scott has said he doesnt want really pizzerias
i think instead of a partnership with fnaf cc should invent their own game with their own lore and a fresh backstory
no matter the reason i think its really sad that theyre retiring the animatronics chuck e cheese was such a big part of my childhood and it wont be the same without them even though i thought the animatronics were creepy back then
lets be honest fnaf didnt make animatronics creepy it just brought that sentiment to the forefront
as a chuck e cheese fan this episode title sure did make me curious on how this topic would be covered lol
tbh i think a large portion of factors can be mentioned in regards to the animatronic band removal but its still pretty tragic 
they used to have a slogan that said make magic without it were just another pizza place and now that feels bitter because of them removing the one thing that really set them apart from anything else 
its honestly quite a shame and as nice as it is that theyre keeping the band at northridge that band has several issues that i doubt theyll fix anytime soon
i hope more stores keep their band or more reopen with the band as a retro store gimmick however its all unpredictable at this point tbh wouldnt surprise me if the brand itself dies within the next decade
some chuck e cheese locations used to have interactive consoles where kids could look at different camera feeds placed around the restaurant they should have kept those around to appeal to fnaf fans
i would definitely prefer that we keep some tactile stuff like these animatronics around theres just simply no comparing a screen and a physical robot the latter is way more fun but uh i dont think fully going in on horror is the move here
im amazed at how much business sense matpat shows on food theory
i remember going to chuck e cheese with my uncle as a kid he worked with all sorts of technology so we always stayed after the place closed while he talked to the staff about the robots lights and sound system i remember being right there on the stage and looking at the animatronics up close and even being able to look at the ways they hid some of the animatronics that werent working without removing them from the stage altogether 

it is one of my favorite memories and i am truly saddened by the fact that they are getting rid of the animatronics
imo if they did make a fnafstyle eatertainment experience id imagine itd be a lot like the movie the animatronics are actually guys in muppet suits and during peak dining hours they close up the stage for supposed maintenance only for the stage to open up a few minutes later and reveal that one of the actors is just inexplicably gone
me being an employee at the billings cec i completely agree with this our characters here in billings are 1 of the last 5 original 3 stage sets and no one i work with including the managers want the characters gone so im all for this we as the fan base just need to step up and save the animatronics we all know and love",26,Howto & Style,5010000,PT16M12S,"['worked chuck cheese manager for year and

i watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
love how olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance  that applause was richly deserved
guts was such a masterpiece i cant wait for next album she literally never misses
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances 
this video demonstrates her creative ability so well and how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass 
being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire olivia never ceases to amaze me 
her breaking the glass part before the chorus is fabulous 
also the scream part is wow  her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
this is exactly what i would imagine an official mv for this song would be like and the fact that she performed it live just perfecf 
ok this performance was a moment also love how she didnt break character once the song was over and was getting applause she stood in that attitude  tongue out cake on the face those eyes glaring at you the intensity so perfect
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 
i love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile were happy and cheerful on the outside and i love the scream so much  thanks olivia 
this performance is insane olivia is such a hard worker her voice her emotions the way she looks is perfect im so grateful i am a teenage girl because of olivia
shes not just another pop queen  besides pop her music has some angst and an edge to it which is awesome  this performance was fantastic
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances
olivia entregando talento como sempre
being a fan since sourthis album blown away my expectations and the performance are just brilliant im a metal and rock listener and olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music hope to see a show of her someday great work
meu deus que performance ela quebrando a taa na virada da msica ficou incrvel
im so proud of her and her improvement in performance watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too 

im glad im going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music she saved me when the sour album dropped it meant a lot to me at that time im in my lowest point sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand i was 16 in my room all day and night because of tracks on sour i can accept my jealousy towards other girls i can relieve my anger towards my exboyfriend some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations like his new girlfriends name sounds so much like mine just slightly different

im 18 now i was so much happier than that time i moved on i forgive and forget i have a lot of new friends and good memories i got into a university and my studying great just like she said shes so much happier than the time when she wrote sour im so happy for her and myself 

hope she can do tour in my country
please come to asia thank u

onepiece wano crunchyroll",1233,"im glad they showed off the seraphims introduction as a threat because it really set the tone of how strong they truly are
i like that blackbeard is a villain who shows concerns and vulnerabilities
he makes him more human and believable than the typical untouchable villains who seem to have everything under control like a god
i like how this shows an emperor can even have a hard time dealing with the new pacifista
after years of being told you arent ready for whats about to come i can confidently say yes i am indeed not ready
blackbeard is so unlikeable but thats also what makes him such a good villain i cant wait to see his rematch with luffy in the future 
i am a blackbeard stan the dude is hilarious powerful opportunistic and cowardly did you all get beaten by just one brat  pure comedy clearly the kid aint normal boss 
if this is what shawk can do imagine what mihawk can actually do
dude i still remember these chapters as if it was yesterday oda was straight cooking with hot grease
if the seraphims are modelled after the warlords it would be interesting to see teach fight a younger version of himself
you know its an abomination against nature because it has mihawks face but made an expression that wasnt a perma scowl or a delighted smirk
blackbeard is shown to be a bumbling drunk at times but that man knows his lore and history in the one piece verse unlike most characters he immediately picked up on the lunarian traits
i cannot stress enough how refreshing blackbeard is as a villain knowing that hes still exploring growing and making moves rather than just being a stagnant force like a lot of other op villains have been
considering that these new seraphimpacifistas have biological qualities to them it is likely that they are capable of getting stronger and learning from their previous fights as they age so if shawk was to fight blackbeard again it would be better equipped and adapted to deal with him  much like mahoraga from jjk
watch episode 1087 here httpsgotcrccop1087
reminder that blackbeards darkdark fruit makes all incoming attacks that hit him hurt more than it would any normal guy pretimeskip he wouldve been crying out in pain and reeling on the floor just goes to show that even against a seraphim blackbeard wasnt doing nothing for two years hes even more of a tank than ever
i really like how they made the seraphim completely silent really makes them feel otherworldly
blackbeard has levelled up dramatically he took on a slice that cut a mountain like butter then blocked the next attack with his haki all this in spite of his df amplifying the pain he feels
interesting enough to see blackbeard dodging and moving swiftly pre time skip he would usually be a sitting duck to most attacks
blackbeard calling him big is right on point if he is that size as a child and still developing imagine how enormous and deadly they would be as adults these pacifista are a potential threat for everyone not controlling them

heres the thing the new wall levels take 9m for a single piece but there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls 4 which can shoot over walls there is a jump and an earthquake spell 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
i actually like this change because for me the archer queens spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible
im a little concerned about the epic equipment especially if its tied to events it kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available
im suspicious of the epic equipment if they are only available from special events and much better than regular equipment theres potential balance issues
243 those ore numbers are spectacular
clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes thank you judo for always keeping us updated with juicy coc contents 
i think this is really cool but i am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level i really hope that levelling up your gear doesnt take ages and ages 

additionally i am very afraid of having epic gear thats limited i really hope that isnt something thats done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get anything limited atm is purely aesthetic and doesnt impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else i hope they keep that in mind
i hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking so you could startegize even further
for me this is just an amazing feature and something i would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops by that knowledge i think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that
the vampire mustache rage crystal and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if dps gets too high cant wait to try it out
great stuff as ever will you be doing an upgrade priority guide i know with most new th levels its the usual routine of th lab cc storages army camps etc but this feels very different and exciting eg with the blacksmith would love some guidance
i really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately for instance using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
its nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th1615 changes
thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation thanks
with the epic equipment for events as long as it doesnt require money to get i think will be such a good idea make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
this is so awesome its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new contentthese are gonna change the game a lot and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears

kier keeps playing with fire at this point dev might make another torture manhunt
the amount of dedication they put in this is more i could put in anything
why does dev always get the most infuriating challenges 
you know its gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
dev started as a hunter and when he got detached he still decided to be speed runner xd
i would love to try some of these challenges myself they seem fun but my computer can barely handle running minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting never mind multiplayer high paced pvp related stuff also i cant speedrun so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this
i love how intense this video was and then the end was the most anticlimactic thing ever
it was supposed to be fun like friends work together actually kinda hit me in the feels feels bad man
kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isnt a bad twist imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
you know id love to see a manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking ie trading doesnt give pearls enderman only spawn in the overworld waterlava source gives cobble and have dev be the speedrunner maybe then hed be kiers speed 3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions in a good way of course

about dougdoug
doug is a sentient bell pepper who was hired by the fbi to crack gaming challenges and also talk about things with food

dougdoug skyrim mod",15153,"we all know the reason chat makes dougs heart rate increase is because doug loves us
dougs heart rate being 20bpm lower than mine shows that a well oiled heart is important
chatdoug do a small dance doug proceeds to dance violently knocking down his green screen
there is never a moment where you feel disconnected from doug his viewer interaction is completely unmatched
the way chat just said let him cook well they were playing rock paper scissors was hilarious
im amazed he kept his heart rate down when cheesewheel gaming was on screen what a trooper
dont you just love dougs cheesewheel gaming moments fucking incredible
i sure do love it when dough pours his cheesewheel gaming all over his viewers
the voice for the spawning bot is perfect
i love the part where doug said cheesewheel gaming and he cheesewheeled all over us
my favorite part of the video is when doug said its cheesewheel gaming time and cheesewheel gaminging on all the bad guys
i love how much effort doug puts into his
cheesewheel gaming videos
the harmonious ending supporting dougs venture was truly cheesewheel gaming so inspirational
as always doug never fails to deliver content to us big cheesewheel gaming content there
i love that chat decided to play along and spawn an army in that rush to dragons bridge
i was at the edge of my seat when that cheesewheel gaming moment happened good thing doug stayed so calm
all of dougs cheesewheel gaming videos are truly an artistic masterpiece
love how dougs cheesewheel gaming moments are always amazing to watch even while having so much cheese

other streamers crying when friends blow up their house 

lazar builds his own house just to blow it up
the fact that the lego mode came out 2 days ago proves that lazar can make videos in that time frame

weve caught him
the fact that lannan is happy and healthy enough to do uploads so quickly really brings me joy really gives early lazar vibes
i find it hilarous that lazar can screw around with literally anything his heart desires
hands down one of the best gamemodes weve gotten
always gonna be a good day when lazar uploads 
lazar never fails to break any game within 12 hours of its release
poor ceeday getting roasted 
lazar being this consistent feels unreal
its truly legendary that lazar is still using the gingerbread skin despite there being a literal skin of him
your creativity in this lego fortnite video is off the charts just like the designs in ytgw0010 truly inspiring work
so cool thing about these golems is that theyre not actually desertspecific either that or they change colour according to whichever biome theyre in
lazar complaning about ceeday not uploading with his upload schedule is criminal
the difference in the amount of time that lazarbeam streamed and the and the amount of time this video is just proves how much he cares about us to be entertained
lazar always finds a way to break every game in existence
i have to say this but this felt like an old lazarbeam video i love just the goofy ideas and music it makes me happy to see this kind of content again thanks lannan
lazar will never fail to attempt to break everything he finds even mullys collarbone

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg im sure they were so happy that he joined them soooo adorable
ryan risked losing his apple watch just to test a review mad respect
the fact that ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane
i was cracking up from start to finish thanks man i needed that 
i always worry about content creators ettiquette when theyre recording in public it fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers 
i went on the harry potter ride many times but this one time i did actually get stuck for a few minutes the people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so i could go on again without waiting i have to say it was worth it 
watching ryan and his dad have fun at the place theyve talked about going together for so long is really heartwarming 3
as someone whos been to universal studios once and loved every second of it i was shocked to learn it had such a low review score i guess the waiting just doesnt bother me that much since im already used to disneyland waiting time
i dont know why but asking the kid if she knew janelle made me laugh so hard and then you saying she is upset and the kid going oh comedy gold
ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist 
i love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh 
universal studios is very popular so there is a reason why its so packed and that the lines are so long there really isnt anything the workers can do to change that the main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line some lines are kinda crazy of course there are a few rides in the harry potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties the ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride whenever ive gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
ryan trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content he took this to an absolute infinity win
i agree with mark we got stuck on the harry potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out i was scared and didnt know anybody else on the same coaster so i just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere
i watch your videos on regular days but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better thank you ryan
ryan never fails to make me smile

were jason and nikki wynn  a couple of modernday documentarians perpetual travelers and seekers of tall tales  

weve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011 why  because curiosity is the key to unlocking life  it pushes us outside our comfort zone softens our assumptions and helps us embrace the great unknown  the more we let our curiosity lead the way the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us

our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land  selfreliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must  its all about managing our resources and were always looking for new and better ways to do so  

weve lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a van to rv to a sailboat and over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy creating safe drinking water and managing our waste

our journey is everevolving but the mission remains the same cultivatecuriosity

tool time with tim was everything sorry for the delay i cant wait to be virtually sailing with you guys
love yallhome improvement was one of my favorite programs cant wait to see yalls first sailing video on the open water
its a process you wouldnt want any other way but to be right  enjoy the journey  hugs for overcoming the challenges 
this is fantastic its about time  good people deserve good things
dear jason and nikki congrats on this most crucial of all milestones perfect flotation she looks stunning i hear your frustration and sense your months of inner exhaustion from anticipating her birth and yet despite your readiness shes gonna be born when she is ready not when anyone else is ready but thats the beauty of it it will all cone true and all be worth it meanwhile luckily you two are incredibly practiced at unpredictable waiting its one of your superpowers youre just stuck in the worlds most unpredictable weather window right now waiting to depart but the weather keeps changing and its all out of your control may you draw on your inner strength its expectation  the set up and the disappointment  that makes it so emotionally exhausting to you for us were just here for the ride and were not going anywhere so please dont worry about pleasing anyone other than yourselves may you just do what you need to do to take care of you sending support and all the positive energy from across the world lee
we started with travel trailers and are now building a boat pretty much because of you guys we took your advice to heart and have learned to sail and are building up our miles and skills before we pick up our own boat great to see how this whole process is unfolding took last weeks break as an opportunity to go back and watch your first couple of months of sailing videos how far you have come
limbo living is always such a challenge  ive experienced it a few times in my 77 years and i now know it was a teachinglearning time for me i admire the way you two are handling it all with such grace and putting it to good use so very eager to see the next step ive been following you since your very early rv days and its always been a joy peace to you both 
i noticed no props or bottom paint so then realized the process is ongoing i was able to watch the commissioning of our new monohull sailboat back in the day a very interesting and exciting process indeed congratulations and glad to see they are making sure everything is done correctly
love all your videos this build has been an adventure to watch can just imagine what your adventure feels like as to ebikes im a private pilot and have a few pilot friends that have ebikes they ftake on their aircraft so lightweight foldable relatively small package when folded durable etc theyve recommended stark drive montague me1 and brompton ebikes not sure if any fit your specsneeds but may be worth at least a look
your episodes never fail to leave us with anticipation of the next one fascinating process i was intrigued by the stepp ed process of checking systems and installing panels in a particular and necessary order thanks for the invitation looking forward to the next video be well niki and jason real close to sailing this jewel on your owncant wait for those episodes
im sure i can speak for many of your fans in saying we love you i understand it can be hard large life events going not quite so perfectly ive gone through some similar things building a barn but i know the wait is going to be worth it youll be so happy were all here to support the both of you as you follow your dreams through the good the bad and the delayed i know it can be hard but keep keeping your heads up you should be proud
im so excited for you and can also feel and see your disappointment on yet more delays thank you for showing us the reality and some of the emotion behind all of this im eagerly awaiting next weeks episode thank you for taking us on this journey with you
it is all just a part of the journey of building our own boat the more you are there the more you learn and the better you will know your own boat thanks for letting us be a part of your lives
congratulations on getting the boat in the water for the first time that was so exciting
you two are so down to earth in contrast with your shiny new yacht its a beautiful thing we need more stories about reasonable people making it 
you guys are awesome  its amazing the time and thought you put in to making great videos  keep up the great work
sorry that youve had so many things to challenge your happiness but great job of presenting the realities of this process  looking forward to seeing yall on board and testing everything out ahead of your future great adventures
i have been watching your videos for several years and find them so very interesting watching how much you have learned and accomplished is highly entertaining thank you

her vocals have improved so much better since drivers licence
her voice her passion her act  her melody her story  her visual everything about her is just perfect
imagine singing this live without backing tracks and just with your raw voice this was absolutely hard hats off to olivia
her vocals her high notes literally everything about her is amazing
her vocals is so amazing both live and in the studio
olivias vocals live or studio never fail to amaze me this quiet but powerful version is amazing
this song is really hard to sing and i applaud her courage to sing this live
was her singing perfect here no 
did her singing move me yes
her delivery the lyrics the piano it moved me and i love her live versions of vampire
i was so surprised to see she had no earpiece she did so well  what i really dont understand though is people saying her vocals have improved so much like huh she has always been this good live maybe her confidence grew and her vocal techniques got better but shes always been an incredible live performer
love this her talent has bloomed so dramatically in the past 10 years videos like this prove this to be true
her voice is so perfect and angelic love you olivia xoxo cant wait to see you in concert
her vocals really improved so much from the past years great job mother liv
ik she has some voice cracks in this but the fact that she still sounds amazing live says something she sounds just like how she does in studio recordings and nobody should hating on her for having voice cracks in her live performances every singer has them sometimes so dont hate on our amazing liv 
olivia conveys so much emotion in every song i love seeing artists perform with no gimmicks just a beautiful girl and her piano well done
the amount of talent she has at 20 i cant wait to see what she does in the upcoming years
what a trip the comment section is totally astroturfed by bots she was a little off key a few times and the shshsh style of vocals is unnecessary but it was a great performance no auto tune is a good thing hearing mistakes makes it better because its genuine
this performance feel so real like her vocals expressions and just genuine felling in this performances is by far the best shes ever done

alan deserves an oscar award
the cowboy hat was clever at first i thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until i realized it also was there to contextualize tscs rotational position in 3d space since otherwise we wouldnt be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape which most of them were
if you could turn this format into a video game youd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics
please never stop doing these biology chemistry logic history anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation thank you
for a spiritual seeker physics student this is emotional
as a physics student i can say that this is amazing i see were going for an interstellar interpretation of singularities which is cool to see as well
alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
this was absolutely stunning to watch i cant wait to see what comes next

maybe an animation vs chemistry 

chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts
genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts its like a whole season of bill nye compressed to the size of a single episode you would make an excellent teacher
as a guy who loves physics i absolutely love this from classical mechanics to general relativity then quantum mechanics alan and his team are do amazing job at this
one of the most relaxing videos i have ever seen proud to say i learned something from this and glad to know i get to exist at the same time as this all the work youve done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given
absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation i absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works keep up it up you and your team are absolutely amazing
woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown just like in math physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity acceleration friction gravity and many more i honestly love how you visualize every details that some people dont know which is crazy i remember learning physics during my high school years until college i know that it sounds really difficult to understand but im sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics thank you so much alan becker and the whole team for making this animation i hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals 
im loving these new new animations  there is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time

amazing job and i cant wait to see whats next
as a civil engineering major junior this and animation vs math have brought me to tears both of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why im still passionate about what im studying thank you 3
this is one of the most impressive things ive seen on youtube in a while respect to the team behind it
this is by far my favorite animation on this channel its so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully you deserve a damn oscar for this
spectacular animation as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that ive learned and for the ones that i have yet to learn it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is and why it is being used in the manner that it is one particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions
this video was a masterpiece from start to finish it has wonderful animation a mere loud story the way you played with lighting and music was genius and it shows the way physics work in a marvellous and fun way both what we know and what we dont 1010",1,Film & Animation,25500000,PT16M8S,"['anything not_ accurate blame lead animator the physic nerd behind this watch the reactioncommentary here', 'alan deserves oscar award', 'the cowboy hat clever first thought just random aesthetic choice until realized also there contextualize tscs rotational position space since otherwise would not_ able tell what direction his body facing unless the surrounding object and environment were not_ symmetrical shape which most them were', 'you could turn this format into video game you would have incredibly powerful tool teach kid physic', 'please never stop doing these biology chemistry logic history anything you think you can display the concept with your team incredible animation thank you', 'for spiritual seeker physic student this emotional', 'physic student can say that this amazing see were going for interstellar interpretation singularity which cool see well', 'alan successfully escalated from classical mechanic string theory', 'this absolutely stunning watch cannot wait see what come next', '', 'maybe animation chemistry', '', 'chemistry much more complex than most people realise and the kind thing you can with are nut', 'genuinely brilliant demonstration these concept like whole season bill nye compressed the size single episode you would make excellent teacher', 'guy who love physic absolutely love this from classical mechanic general relativity then quantum mechanic alan and his team are amazing job this', 'one the most relaxing video have ever seen proud say learned something from this and glad know get exist the same time this all the work you have done incredible and deserves all the praise ever given', 'absolutely beautiful portrayal such complex topic simplified and fun animation absolutely adore your passion and commitment these amazing work keep you and your team are absolutely amazing', 'woah this animation super amazing and mind blown just like math physic lot broad and interesting topic like velocity acceleration friction gravity and many more honestly love how you visualize every detail that some people not_ know which crazy remember learning physic during high school year until college know that sound really difficult understand but sure that this animation will help lot student motivates them study more about physic thank you much alan becker and the whole team for making this animation hope that you guy continue make more this with new learning and creative visuals', 'loving these new new animation there much information packed into every frame and equation with storyline the same time', '', 'amazing job and cannot wait see what next', 'civil engineering major junior this and animation math have brought tear both them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why still passionate about what studying thank you', 'this one the most impressive thing have seen youtube while respect the team behind', 'this far favorite animation this channel complex yet simple the same time and executed beautifully you deserve damn oscar for this', 'spectacular animation physic student clearly and intuitively presented many the concept that have learned and for the one that have yet learn described such way that even without the practice instruction the simplicity and action allows for good understanding what each variable and why being used the manner that one particular example would your demonstration gravity assist for even without ever having been involved equation the sort the explanation through animation able clearly demonstrate why the input variable were there and generate broad stroke understanding how the equation function', 'this video masterpiece from start finish wonderful animation mere loud story the way you played with lighting and music genius and show the way physic work marvellous and fun way both what know and what not_ 1010']",968

bloxfruits  roblox gamerrobot gaming",38802,"kitsune beautiful 
the sounds effects are so satisfying
theres something ive dreamed of seeing in blox since i started playing collision between attacks being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible using the ice x to stop attacks for example this would definitely change the blox combat style as well as making it more complex and in my opinion interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful
i personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island i think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled tree top
the z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender x move is lookin like the best combo starter fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer f is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage base

mode
riding is ultimate furry half joking lol
z move looks alot better fits the transformation
x move is honestly worse than non mode x range is way to short and can only be used as an extender but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
c move is practically the same just more aoe and probably damage
f move is just a slightly better version of itself not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

opinion is leopard better yes and no leopard is more spammy than kitsune but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

bonus fox lamp
z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it 
x tap good extender with seemingly good damage
xhold imo worse than tap x but better for aoe

is it better than the best sword aka cdk no it has potential but cdk has more combo potential and most likely more damage

i wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol

the devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
most visually pleasing fruit imo hope for more much better updates to come been playing this quite a while and although i hate grind games this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games ive ever played
i wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless i do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations i am looking forward to using this fruit in the future
this seems to be a good antiteamer fruit flashy incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others plus i see amazing combo potential with kitsune and fox lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
i started playing blox fruits a while back and blox fruits has really stepped up their game they have recently come out with update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new max level this new max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play they also definetly know what they are doing they always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often this update 20 came out somewhat around the time of one piece live action which means that when players watch one piece live action they might understand more about blox fruits and want to play well done blox fruits 
i think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon i hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion
i love this fruit and all the mechanics the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers cant wait for the dragon and control rework

it would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragons moves just to see if they are worth buying
055
lets just appreciate how much a lot of time gamer robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day huge respect  
when transforming like a fox maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler
maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work
i think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run  skycamp with tbh

hopescope on tiktok for some laughs",3064,"does this mean were getting an i bought every american girl doll video because i would definitely watch that
i find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because i still see them every year
we loved having you and your team out to the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with us hope
as an american girl doll collector you did amazing at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls im so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again
as a professional baker ive made a barbie cake like that before a few tips for the next time wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in less mess that way also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 
love how you called the newer polly pockets clothes chewy 
i could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game i would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood
hey hope that polly was original but the castle is actually a star castle i had that exact one equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely its own vibe 
as a kid i had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what i was working toward after months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house she was finally mine 
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday so i was surprised to see them in here lol
i had the tiny polly pockets and rollerblading kira she was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything the essence of 1991 i had no idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like a lighter lol 
i wanted a samantha doll more than anything as a kid her books were the reason i started to love to read 
i love seeing how far hope has come i remember watching yall her videos in order and i would get sooo excited when i got a notification saying she posted and i still get as excitedi wish you good luck on reaching 4m
i was 30 in 2004 but the mary kate  ashley game still got me the graphics were crazy lol i remember my children wanting some of these items lol thanks hope
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
actually loving all the background changes in this video  it made it much more animated and fun
i legit had that rollerblade barbie she was my favorite i also think ag dolls were better overall quality when pleasant company was still in control the most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing everything was so true to life with little clasps and now its all cheap velcro but for the same price  also the dolls were made in germany back then  not china
i wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious  i love seeing childhood products i never got to have if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
for the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones you can find them at target it made me so happy to see 
my daughter actually loves polly pockets they make them in different varieties now there are ones with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge bodies and others with plasticsilicone forms called micro polly thats the small compact versions ",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S,"['doe this mean were getting bought every american girl doll video because would definitely watch that', 'find strange that the monster cereal were apparently discontinued because still see them every year', 'loved having you and your team out the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with hope', 'american girl doll collector you did amazing pointing out the difference between the era doll happy see many people finding their love for these doll again', 'professional baker have made barbie cake like that before few tip for the next time wrap the lower half your doll plastic wrap before you stick her mess that way also stick her before you decorate the cake that way the bodice the dress match the skirt', 'love how you called the newer polly pocket clothes chewy', 'could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game would definitely watch live you playing relive childhood', 'hey hope that polly original but the castle actually star castle had that exact one equally cute and nostalgic but definitely own vibe', 'kid had chore chart with picture that 2000s samantha doll taped reminder what working toward after month and month getting few buck week for doing job around the house she finally mine', 'the monster cereal were fully stocked target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday surprised see them here lol', 'had the tiny polly pocket and rollerblading kira she hip and the little fanny pack everything the essence 1991 had idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like lighter lol', 'wanted samantha doll more than anything kid her book were the reason started love read', 'love seeing how far hope come remember watching you all her video order and would get sooo excited when got notification saying she posted and still get excitedi wish you good luck reaching', '2004 but the mary kate ashley game still got the graphic were crazy lol remember child wanting some these item lol thanks hope', 'hope amazing she put much time work and money into these video just grateful for her', 'actually loving all the background change this video made much more animated and fun', 'legit had that rollerblade barbie she favorite also think doll were better overall quality when pleasant company still control the most noticeable detail were the doll clothing everything true life with little clasp and now all cheap velcro but for the same price also the doll were made germany back then not_ china', 'wish there hour this content scrumptious love seeing childhood product never got have you ever want make this video longer wed watch queen', 'for the polly pocket they brought back the 2000s one you can find them target made happy see', 'daughter actually love polly pocket they make them different variety now there are one with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge body and others with plasticsilicone form called micro polly that the small compact version']",1182

brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
is it just me or is barleys animation different looks crazy cool ngl 328
finalmente uma skin em homenagem a ns brasileiros
i think it would be cool if you made a brawler where you transform into a second character with the ultimate this means that at the beginning you are for example a melee fighter and then with the ultimate you are a thrower
the star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past the fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all

they should do this w male best friends a brooff i feel like it could actually get quite interesting to see the dynamics of male friendships
its awesome that cody is hiring from his fan base there are so many talented people out there who just havent been given the chance to show off their work on a larger scale 
seeing ppl fight over who is smarter never fails to be insanely cringe and dumb
thats literally so likable of that girl to admit that she was a bit spoiled
i love women but eve seems so boy crazy thats shes willing to throw her friends under the bus for male validation
eve saying that she felt like sadie wasnt over it is strange since eve seemed like the one who was still upset
its interesting eve and sadie said theres no jealously but eve seems like she has repressed envy of sadie and serious selfesteem issues any woman who goes out of their way to be sexual with a man they know their friend has been or is interested in is not your real friend
i dont see how sadie can still blame her ex about this situation your friend is in the wrong not because of his manipulation or whatever but because shes a bad friend eve can try to sugar coat it as much as she wants but its a two way street
the nerve of eve to look so irritated at the other girl telling the story but what she did was 10x worse
eves was toxic because it was entitlement behavior she may or may not be a completely entitled princess or she may be a sporadic one but that was unmistakably entitled behavior
i just know eve is the type of friend whos secretly always wishing for sadies downfalls i think this is a lot more common than people realize or are willing to admit about female friendshipssociety pits women against each other and all that jazzbut most of us grow out of that mentality by likehigh school at the latest i hope this is a wake up call for eve and motivates her to do some self reflection and work on her insecurities
its the way eve seemed still angry about what happened with sadie and her ex when she was fully lying about her and sadies ex hooking up only once
i dont get how she can put all the blame on her ex for cheating on her because shes not surprised he acted that way after learning how he was but completely doesnt even blame her best friend for purposefully sleeping with him multiple times as if it wasnt a betrayal on both of their parts

comment omg get over it already ur reading this

kurtisconner",7115,"when i see a new kurtis upload i jump up and down and squeal like a little pig
thinking wed actually get a barbie analysis from kurtis was too good to be true
i understand the trilogy has come to an end but a bonus round comparing barbie video games to bratz video games is kind of warranted
thank you so much to the pokmon company international for sponsoring todays video click the link here to download pokmon unite

httpsbitlyholidaykurtisconner
i loved that kurtis reverted back to poc women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt poc women an ally through and through
how dare thee call me a wizard has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
i dont think im ready for the barbie vs bratz series to end
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i havent skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a barbie girl from childhood to now i am praying for a new andor remake of the bratz liveaction barbie was phenomenal for what it was imagine what we could have with bratz and to add we need a better monster high liveaction i said what i said
so glad the microchips line thats been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved lifesized as much as many of us did
congratulations on being sponsored by pokmon so proud and happy for you
as a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with bratz
glad the you dont have a daddy or a bankaccount line got the recognition it deserves been on my mind for years 
as a hispanic person yasmins part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
you should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more please and thanks target audience reached
idc how bad the bratz live action is it will always be part of my core memories

danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
for me barbie in the nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation
i would just like to point out that dannys little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker its a toy soldier
did you drink enough water today shoutout to air up for sponsoring this video try scentbased taste right now you cant miss all these holiday deals httpsairuplink3mmlipo
i could not take it with the dads reaction to the pebble i was laughing so hard the blank stare the trembling hands the concerned look from his wife like what could this rock have possibly done to you why do they never talk about it again
i love how what started as a quirky and unconventional nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left danny with more questions than answers about the original tale
fun fact this movie was funded by literal russian state and was the most expensive russian movie to date
ill be honest as a ballerina just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was hysterical
i would gladly watch you review ballets swan lake has like 4 different endings i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives
as a ballerina watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious especially when you referred to fritz as this little freak
that end bit scared me so bad i actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat seeing danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing ive witnessed in a while
its nice to see danny hasnt lost his christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen
can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with dannys toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass
i laughed so hard i fell off my bed when he said he misses his pebble
im honestly surprised that danny didnt make the connection that love on a leash also had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form now i just wanna know if theres any more movies with characters like that
what a stunning cast baby elle fanning snowbell from stuart little and moaning myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of the nutcracker the worlds ever seen
hiring albert einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex ive ever seen
thank you for watching the ballet danny sincerely every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the nutcracker
my little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago i rented this for her hoping shed love it i feel so bad

the masked enemy is going to be absolute chaos with the larger lobby mod with giant groups of them on the map
the horrorcomedy combo of the masked in the ship repeatedly walking over the whoopie cushion 
no intro straight to business perfection
masked a creepy figure which takes over the body of the individual it possesses like a parasite forcing them to turn against their teammates to spread the mask

nutcracker lmao shotgun
it would be fun if the mask gives you some incredible power temporarily see monsters through walls temporarily see loot through walls etc but with an increasing chance of becoming possessed with each use
the masked is actually a great way to implement the mimic idea they didnt lean too much into the horror and too much into the comedy and fits the game perfectly
hey wurps i know you probably wont see this but i really wanna state how helpful each video of yours has been all are very informative and ive learned more tricks than i can count with your help keep making more
the spray can is very useful i remember an old indie game called erie had it as a mechanic to remind yourself where the exit at
i love the asthmatic of comedytragedy masks so when i saw that they added them i was ecstatic

i check the shop hoping to see the mask as a cosmetic for that day instead i leave with the pajama man i now worship the pajama man but thats besides the point

as i enter titan i stumble across a storage type room about 3 rooms from the door on one of the shelves i find a fancy mask darn its a scrap not a cosmetic i wonder if i can wear it 

to my glee you can left click to hold the mask to your face i should scare someone when they enter i though

twice more i put on the mask but right before someone enters i suddenly cannot remove the mask and everything turns red all they hear is my anguished cries before i go silent i proceeded to kill my entire team resulting in us losing the quota worth of scrap and one day to make it up

this game is awful 1010 would do again
one big thing to note about the masked enemies is that they will follow you outside the facility
someone should make a decoy that looks like a playerscarecrow that can be places to hold the coil head in space by looking at it
my friends and i discovered the masks organically we brought a mask back to the ship as well as a crewmates body when the mask makes contact with a corpse it automatically takes it over we were very confused as to why our friends body just got up and started walking
702 max speed is slightly less  you get the fear effect whenever it spots you
i love that players that have been bodyjacked by a shyguy still keep their friendly marker on the ship radar so unaware cams players can try to rescue them with the teleporter
my god i was just thinking that i wanted an enemy that hijacks your body this dev knows whats fun 
i hope that masked teamates still appear friendly on the radar i want mind games
important thing about the mask it can possess corpses always be wary of abandoning a corpse in rend you might see it walk out of the front door
i find it funny how the aracnophobia mode was added because just yesterday i was teaching a young cousin about the game and he was handling the game pretty well very scared all this considered but when it got to the spiders he got absolutely terrified when he was walking back trying to find the way out and found spider webs and i told him that was the bunker spider and he asked me to pick the keyboard and play just for that bit so he could go back to the ship and continue playing after id say the aracnophobia option will help him greatly lmao
i absolutely love love love that the power of the signal transmitter to keep the run alive is matched by it also just being another source of dread and terror
 imagine you are in the facility alone in the dark surrounded by monsters and you just see r u n or g o o d b y e fill your entire vision
 that is such a disheartening way to send bad news its perfect

ojgaming supercellpartner",847,"supercell has officially lost it
i cant wait for the day you can turn your king tower into an eagle artillery
i cant wait to spend all of my familys savings on maxing out tower troops
to be honest the new cannon troop looks powerful against tanks but its going to get annihilated by cycle swarm bait gy decks if it really has a 22 second attack speed those are some free goblin barrels its probably gonna be costly to level up but it doesnt seem advantageous to me just feels more rockpaperscissors if anything
cant wait to start hoarding troop cards to level up my princess towers one level in every three years i wonder what else fun they are going to do in future years maybe make the king a card and make us pay even more
tower troops seem like a really bad idea since this would counter win conditions at random and make matchmaking even more luck based for example if they add a splash damage tower troop skeleton barrel perishes on the spot
the warmth challenge is one of the most interesting challenge ive seen
every card feels balanced around how much damage spells the princess towers and defensive buildings do to them the moment any one of those aspects are changed heavily the meta will definitely be torn from the ground up into something new
supershell never fails to disappoint 
i cant believe we gotta now pay to upgrade our towers 
what is supercell thinking
i like how oj deeply analyzes the troop tower video when he can justo wait for the oficial video in a few weeks algo great description of the warmth spell 
the warmth cardsnowstorm is a brilliant idea ive always felt like there should be something in each arena to make each of them unique rain doesnt count
i just noticed that the warmth spell is able to heal crown towers
cant wait to use this to chesse close match overtime 
honestly oj analysing the frames is actually really helpful
warmth spells heal princess towers and probably king towers aswell i also cant wait for evolved firecracker on the princess tower
actually magic archer is quite op in this challenge because if your opponent keep stacking things you can use the 

power of geometry
introducing the warmth spell really makes me think that you can possible make a puzzle level with it having already frozen troops on your and the opponents side this would honestly only be possible if there were like an evolved mirror where i used the card on both sides

i think the attack speed getting reduced on charlie was the icing on the cake because in reality none of the other nerfs mattered if she can still spam her main attack
the amount of effort you put in behind the scenes to get us the data is awesome and underrated
honestly we really need an olympics again it would be cool to just see where every brawler is with all of the olympics kairos has made
the amount of joy i felt while hearing all the nerf to charlie was like waking up to gifts under the christmas tree  
subscribe for mico kit  larry sneak peeks
5v5 looks insanely fun its the mode ive been looking forward to the most
i noticed that when you were testing lous super charge rate on the before side lou had his epic supercharge gear equipped i think this could have affected the outcome but idk
lets all thank kairos for putting so much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peaks
0002 update includes progression buffs for freetoplay players and new balance changes
0153 edgars hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed
0519 several brawlers are receiving significant buffs to their attack damage and health

1605 new system brings significant buffs for freetoplay players
1734 freetoplay players getting a 132 buff to coins
2044 the new brawl pass offers more gems free credits and extra perks
2222 brawl pass plus offers 96 more coins 79 more power points and exclusive perks
2535 chroma credits will be converted to regular credits affecting the cost of buying chromatic brawlers
2719 new skins showcase and details
3056 new skins and animations for different brawlers
3244 new skins and upgrades coming in the update
every time this man uploads i think of how much work he actually puts into this the math and everything
3254 it really looks like hes firing power points with his main attack and i also love the fact that cil turned into a starr drop
i love the direction this game has been going as a whole but as a long term player i hope down the road they make a prestige progression system with exclusive rewards down the road i hope this game never dies i always look forward to the brawl talks and podcasts im so happy there only monthly seasons now
i feel like charlie  will never be under b or c tier even after the nerfs her super is still pretty easy to charge and the fact its a 5 second stun since ppl rarely seem to help get their teammates out of the cocoon anyway is still very good her dps on long range will probably be almost the same her attack is still pretty fast and easy to hit but i do like the fact shes not a must pick anymore
love to see my favourite ever mobile game get such a good update and such regular updates they are always trying new things and adding stuff
thanks for always making excellent and informative content 
i think the most oppressive part about charlie was honestly her projectile speed it is incredibly easy to land shots and hard to dodge and since she doesnt have normal ammo this means she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge i do think her super should be straight up reworked but thats a different topic nerfing the spiders and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though
kudos to kairos for making this video
what a huge amount of content you have to cover
im super excited for that mortis buff mortis has been and is still my favorite character in the game and this simply means that hes going to be able to get that extra healing off 50 quicker which if hes in a big bundle of enemies then hes just gonna be able to heal that much quicker
i do really appreciate how kairos does these videos and how he makes calculations for everyone so they can see how the value of their money translates but when he talks on buying every brawl pass in the old system i feel we should consider even most paying players but every other pass with gems so his stats for that seem a little off to me personally",20,Gaming,1050000,PT34M22S,"['crow going take out the bos fast with the new hypercharge', 'think the attack speed getting reduced charlie the icing the cake because reality none the other nerfs mattered she can still spam her main attack', 'the amount effort you put behind the scene get the data awesome and underrated', 'honestly really need olympics again would cool just see where every brawler with all the olympics kairos made', 'the amount joy felt while hearing all the nerf charlie like waking gift under the christmas tree', 'subscribe for mico kit larry sneak peek', '5v5 look insanely fun the mode have been looking forward the most', 'noticed that when you were testing lous super charge rate the before side lou had his epic supercharge gear equipped think this could have affected the outcome but not_ know', 'let all thank kairos for putting much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peak', '0002 update includes progression buff for freetoplay player and new balance change', '0153 edgar hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed', '0519 several brawler are receiving significant buff their attack damage and health', '0712 buff and nerfs various brawler', '1043 brawl star update brings change game mode and introduces optional ingame', '1232 brawl pas system change and update', '1605 new system brings significant buff for freetoplay player', '1734 freetoplay player getting 132 buff coin', '2044 the new brawl pas offer more gem free credit and extra perk', '2222 brawl pas plus offer more coin more power point and exclusive perk', '2535 chroma credit will converted regular credit affecting the cost buying chromatic brawler', '2719 new skin showcase and detail', '3056 new skin and animation for different brawler', '3244 new skin and upgrade coming the update', 'every time this man uploads think how much work actually put into this the math and everything', '3254 really look like firing power point with his main attack and also love the fact that cil turned into starr drop', 'love the direction this game been going whole but long term player hope down the road they make prestige progression system with exclusive reward down the road hope this game never always look forward the brawl talk and podcasts happy there only monthly season now', 'feel like charlie will never under tier even after the nerfs her super still pretty easy charge and the fact second stun since people rarely seem help get their teammate out the cocoon anyway still very good her long range will probably almost the same her attack still pretty fast and easy hit but like the fact she not_ must pick anymore', 'love see favourite ever mobile game get such good update and such regular update they are always trying new thing and adding stuff', 'thanks for always making excellent and informative content', 'think the most oppressive part about charlie honestly her projectile speed incredibly easy land shot and hard dodge and since she doe not_ have normal ammo this mean she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge think her super should straight reworked but that different topic nerfing the spider and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though', 'kudos kairos for making this video', 'what huge amount content you have cover', 'super excited for that mortis buff mortis been and still favorite character the game and this simply mean that going able get that extra healing off quicker which big bundle enemy then just going able heal that much quicker', 'really appreciate how kairos doe these video and how make calculation for everyone they can see how the value their money translates but when talk buying every brawl pas the old system feel should consider even most paying player but every other pas with gem his stats for that seem little off personally']",2062

fortnite fortnitetips lego legofortnite fortnitelego guide gaming gameplay minecraft survivalgame  fortnitebattleroyale tipsandtricks legofortnitetips",247,"when the npcs are glitching out like that then try talking to them first  if that doesnt work then continue doing what youre doing
one thing i like about the prefab builds is theyre modular you can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with shack doors to create passible outbuildings
biggest building issue ive had is there doesnt seem to be a way to change the elevation of your nonprefab foundations making it hard to keep things at the same level
destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
you can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches  yes it costs more wood however itll light up the cave for you so its easier to find whatever your looking for
before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating not a tip
dont just throw away tools that you dont use use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it they can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation
really fantastic synopsis and tips you nailed it i would add 
build your first village at the edge of a desert border and near a knotwood cave not where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient
build a bed at the mouth of a cave as a save point if you die you respawn in your bed you wont have to travel back to your quest point
empty almost all of your backpack before beginning a quest youll need the inventory slots
pack for a trip max wood planks to build repair chests cooked food snowberry shakes or cheesy burgers
its good to stack lumber mills it makes crafting so much quicker
something i always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever i need to collect granite i take that villager and start going at some rocks unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
if you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and itll destroy everything for you
go on top of moutains that have large trees cut them down roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
i love to make a village stylish and neat it is the most important thing 
man this was one of the coolest surprises of the year  ive always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome  whod have thought it would be fortnite to do it
youre lucky  the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and thats with infinite stamina  however the cold biome is 2 steps away
make glider  build staircases 11 high make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as i land i build another one so i can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol i even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so i know the direction they follow back to back  helps tons on the map
stamina bar is important when youre flying with a glider it consumes your stamina while up in the air by the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die
i personally think temp dont matter as muchbut stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didnt go down so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills lumber mills work benches etc then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
the way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me that way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells and the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S,"['when the npc are glitching out like that then try talking them first that doe not_ work then continue doing what you are doing', 'one thing like about the prefab build they are modular you can knock out the wall double shack and replace them with shack door create passible outbuilding', 'biggest building issue have had there doe not_ seem way change the elevation your nonprefab foundation making hard keep thing the same level', 'destroying bush actually easier with sword', 'for right now traveling the main issue cannot that you have walk min just get cave once you mined the cave kind nearby your village walk min the next dessert just you can die bcs you did not_ know that the mob there are way stronger', 'you can also build campfire inside cave instead using torch yes cost more wood however will light the cave for you easier find whatever your looking for', 'before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting cheating not_ tip', 'not_ just throw away tool that you not_ use use villager follower and you can give them those tool and they will use they can hold multiple tool and just swap the best one depending the situation', 'really fantastic synopsis and tip you nailed would add', 'build your first village the edge desert border and near knotwood cave not_ where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient', 'build bed the mouth cave save point you die you respawn your bed you will not_ have travel back your quest point', 'empty almost all your backpack before beginning quest you will need the inventory slot', 'pack for trip max wood plank build repair chest cooked food snowberry shake cheesy burger', 'good stack lumber mill make crafting much quicker', 'something always with the spare pickax give one designated adventuring villager and whenever need collect granite take that villager and start going some rock unfortunately they still use the pickax for fighting even over even though the brown pickaxe doe damage per second compared just punching keep that mind you are messing about the dark with them', 'you find boulder hill and you need mat just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and will destroy everything for you', 'top moutains that have large tree cut them down roll the log down farm granite and wood super easy', 'love make village stylish and neat the most important thing', 'man this one the coolest surprise the year have always thought minecraft style game the lego world would awesome who would have thought would fortnite', 'you are lucky the desert minute run away from spawn point and that with infinite stamen however the cold biome step away', 'make glider build staircase high make platform and you now got jump pad that will take you way further then the geyser and soon land build another one can basically the whole map under min instead hour lol even put marker every staircase jump pad know the direction they follow back back help ton the map', 'stamen bar important when you are flying with glider consumes your stamen while the air the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die', 'personally think temp not_ matter muchbut stam will literally make you the beginning because you can just outrun most early thing like wolf', 'noticed when you broke your grill the village point did not_ down technically you could just place down crap ton grill lumber mill work bench etc then destroy them get the material back and again and again', 'the way get the sand shell using shield and getting one villager follow that way follower can get the attention and can ham for the shell and the shield help the randomly start going for you']",668

unlike most of your covered incidents this seemed much less a swiss cheese model and much more a tragic plethora of challenges and confusion happening all at once so sad since the crew had been so professional and cautious
ive been an airline captain for 37 consecutive years have in excess of 27000 hrs pic on 777 767 737 a320 727 and atr 
im still learning been lucky on my career so far without any serious trouble to date
i must say this channels content is the most precious ever its a valuable learning tool 
my sincere compliments to mentour pilot
i live in rostovondon and this tragedy really shocked all of us and unfortunately someone i know were affected and lost the members of their families ive read a lot of investigations and different articles about this catastrophe but only here and now i really understood what happened thank you for this video and explanation and may all the crash victims rest in peace 
im an air traffic controller and we use your videos extensively during ect not only to provide better assistance during time of need but also to learn valuable lessons that could potentially help us in the future never too old or experienced to learn and your videos serve as excellent library of information thank you for the amazing content
the copilot was a friend of my brother and i from years before the tragedy we knew him quite well from those years he was smart and thorough i investigated all that i could of how and what happened and i saw he tried to save this situation as much as possible but the captain was tremendously confused and deep in tunnel vision to back off his decisions and start trusting instruments in time very very sad rip alex
ive been a pilot for 17 years here in germany not only is this channel informative it also serves as a valuable learning tool for pilots all across the globe the simulator is a fantastic learning device but most accidents i feel can be attributed to overload stress and crew resource management basic communication between crew members is absolutely essential if something is wrong mention it and a good captain uses his resources and listens inexperience does not always equal a wrong answer 

thank you for your videos they are second to none and a vital resource for any current or future pilot you may be saving future lives with your informative videos
i remember watching your videos when you were on the sofa with the notes and the dogs there was nothing wrong with that and i still love your old video but its so amazing to see how youve grown the channel into making tv quality documentaries at this point youre an inspiration petter
i can only imagine how fast the final 59 seconds must have occurred in that cockpit also to be in the back of the plane at that time of morning after waiting and waiting and waiting the horror that some of the alert passengers must have realized was about to happen i can only pray that the impact was so sudden so severe and so instant that nobody had any chance to feel that for even a second wonderful job here as always describing the events as true to life as possibly thank you

i was not really prepared for this to end in such a tragic crash it seemed like such a simple issue but unfortunately that wasnt the case this is one of the accidents that are so sad because it seemed so preventable my condolences to all who lost their loved ones
as a frequent flyer i treasure these insights into how safe aviation travel is  flying is complicated and yet flying is still the safest mode of transportation  channels like yours showcase what can go wrong but highlight what prevents these accidents from happening in the first place
great job petter describing a sad accident that simply should not have happened
im a retired 30k hour captain with lots of time on both the 737800 with its fabulous hud and other boeings up to and including the 747400
it was a really sad very disturbing story showing how absolutely critical it is to stay ahead of the aeroplane 
i wonder why he was so loathe to use autopilot in such conditions
the quality of the explanation at 3316 behindahead of the aircraft is just insane thank you mentour for letting us enjoy your lectures
my friend live in a building bordering the airport 
when plane smashed into the ground the whole building was shaken and few windows got broken 
some small fragments of the aircraft were scattered across his and some nearby buildings roofs 

that should give you a rough idea of the forces involved
as a young engineer that only just started her career in aviation i must thank you and your team for your hard work explaining each and every incident you cannot imagine how your content not only helps pilots but also other people who work in aviation
thanks to your content ive understood things more in depth and it brought a new meaning to my job as an aeronautics engineer and how much every detail can make a change

keep up the good work 
the fltcrew were well trained and performed well until the 2nd approach this terrible accident brings many things into question including if were reaching the limits of the manmachine interface as it currently exist 
pieter your content and presentation is absolutely amazing 
i felt this one in my bones
rip to all aboard
these episodes now blow any sort of nat geo type air incident documentaries with all their overly dramatic entertainment elements out of the water
massive thanks to you petter and all of your superb team  so well explained presented and executed

i like the new fortnite lego game mode its something new and fresh
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest its way better than we all expected
one can only imagine how theyre going to continue developing the mode it has so much potential i cant wait to see where we go from here personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
also i found out if youre behind a bush while killing the boss dude he wont attack you he gets confused also another glitch if you put down a new chest and put your swords farming tools etc in it and punch it to break it it heals your weapons and farming tools note this will be patched asap im sure but it works for now
i hope you enjoyed the new mode its been a ton of fun for me and the boys 
i think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby as a person who experienced that myself today was my first time playing chapter 5 i absolutely loved battle royale but i clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in lego
i had some experience with motion capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall kudos to the devs its a funny detail you wouldnt neccessary expect in a game like this one ps you almost saw me as leon in these new resident evil games 
so far this mode is pretty similar to minecraft if they update regularly this can become an original masterpiece
keep it up creamy the new mode is really fun tho
you know its a good day when mccreamy uploads
ive been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative im so excited for this game mode theres so many possibilities
mccreamy is a legend bro makes a boring day into a good one love this guy 
i think that this is the best day that theyve had in a while amazing job fortnite 
mccreamy never fails to make good content  
can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 
i love how he steps out of his way just to entertain us
you can tell this mode is gonna be succesfull and i trust epic games in keeping it updated and interesting

liverpool lfc",2893,"endo couldnt have been more clinical the way he places that shot is just beautiful trent was outstanding once again
endo has been contributing with every match he plays hope he continues to make his presence felt in that liverpool midfield
i think wataru endos goal boosted the teams motivation and brought the last goal to win
all long distance goals from liverpool what a team
aside from the phenomenal strikes this game was amazing because our midfield showed they can get the goals even when the forwards arent scoring adds a dynamic weve lacked for years
unforgettable match
really missed allison 
which goal was best comment below
many liverpool fans didnt expect endo to score but if you knew him in stuttgart you knew it was a situation where he excelled
cant remember the last liverpool game with 4 goals and not one attacker on the score sheet   mind blowing those goals were all just simply amazing
cant get to choose my favourite that stunning freekick full of confidence to open the game the world class strike from macca to put us ahead once again that clinical finish from endo to get us back in the game just 4mins after he came in from the bench or the glorious finisherwinner from trent 90secs later what a game blessed to be a liverpool fan
what the goal from endo as a japanese im glad that he is getting used to his new task here and contributing to the team with this amazing goal
trentmac allisterendo unbelievable goals 
gakpo and endo change the game really change the game 
what a goal by alexis mac alistair
endo actually turned the game around at the last few minutes 
endos goal was the much needed strike to turn things around for us this team is just incredible
goal of the season by alexis mac allister

thank you so much for being here and watching
i really hope you enjoyed 

miamaples dior expensive",4430,"the fact that the dior advent calendar is more expensive than buying everything individually at retail price
petition for mia to turn the dior box into a doll house
i love that dior is so aware that their 5400 is ridiculous that they actually pay someone to call you up and ask are you sure 
the disney swarovski set was underwhelming given how many characters disney owns
charlotte tillbury one was the only one thats worth it it provided all the basics that you need for makeupbesides foundation and concealer and stuff that you need to pick individually for your skin complexion so if someone wants to get into charlotte tillbury or just high end makeup this will be a perfect thing to buy props to them
only mama maples can make the best out of the worst situation of being scammed but a luxury company
in my limited experience the more expensive the calendar the higher the disappointment cant go wrong with a cheap one its only up from there 
i got progressively angrier at dior the farther we went even if they did retail that much theyre a scam and they dont even retail its disgusting
im a retired nurse  and in my life would never be able to afford  to indulge in even one of these products  saying that  i really enjoyed seeing you and your mom unbox these calendars  thank you for the opportunity to experience this with you this is the first video ive watched of yours and subscribed immediately  merry christmas and happy new year
has mama maples ever not been a ray of absolute sunshine   i cannot imagine her mad
i dont know maybe the cost was making you guys giddy but i cackled so hard during the dior unboxing thanks for the laugh 
am i the only one hearing that they are saying swarvoski and she also spelled it that way on the screen where she announces the different advent calendars i think thats so funny  love the energy
also the fact that mama maples tries to educate mia on all the disney characters is sooo funny 
watching mias advent calendar videos is now one of my christmas traditions lol i get stunned by the prices every year
mia im sorry that dior is so extra however these are the most fun videos i look forward to them every year i love momma maples reactions shes so priceless thank you
1913 the moment mia goes to stop mama maples from trying the lipstick  she is so cute
both of those went totally in a different direction than i expected i thought disney would be a new character every box and i have no idea why dior i assumed makeup this was a wild ride 
i love when your mom gets excited about opening the boxes the wows all made me laugh
i love how her mom is excited for everything 
i feel like these videos are 100 times funnier because of mama maples haha ill strive to be a mom like her some day

httpshareepidemicsoundcomphdft",5831,"ive never seen someone buy so many items at a japanese electronic store you must have broken a record 
thanks for having me along for the day man was a lot of fun
hope youve got some snacks ready  this is the longest video weve ever made  which countrys tech do you want us to test next
looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in japan next time round how about scoping out some everyday gizmos would love to see how japans hometech game stacks up against ours
your one of my favorite youtubers arun you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
fun fact there was actually another company in japan called logitec its spelled the same as logitech in japanese and they were in japan before logitech was able to open up anything in japan so they had to change their name to logicool in japan only to avoid a name conflict
this is so surreal ive been letting the abroad in japan channel build up videos to binge and after the frozen frontier series i went back to another video from arun to finish it and i was like oh yeah theres a new video i wanna watch that and now seeing chris walk in was like

the only way i can express the feeling was imagine you watch a tv show and then switch to another tv show only to see the character from the other tv show nonchalantly walk in like what
that trackball mouse is something i used at my job back in the late 80s early 90s youve never seen one before 
this was a great collab  love to watch both yours and chriss channels 
that store completely blows my mind i could be in there for days
love the longer video btw this was enjoyable to watch
i might be one of the few japanese subscribers of your channel your videos are awesome and i genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho hope youll come back soon
i think i can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food genuinely amazing
the timing of those memes is just chefs kiss
i love how excited arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol
the ball mouse is called a trackball pretty useful especially helping reduce rsi its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it also for fine control you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate
3920 first time in japan over twenty years ago taught me that rice is not a bulk up  filler  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion  its a hard sell to a lot of westerners   
but  its my occasional once or twice a year life mission
im a japanese in the uk and i really enjoyed this  shame the kids watch wont work in the uk with child safety more of an issue here than in japan it would probably do relatively well here  i love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years  yum asia do good ones in the uk and not as expensive as the japanese leader but similar technology i didnt see it in the video and i know its not a cooking channel but i hope you washed the rice first 
its my dream to go to japan definitely visiting this tech place when i eventually go 
touch ball mice are used a lot in north america canada more then usa they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as autocad maya blender and image creation such as krita photoshop etc they work very well for a lot of things even gaming i loved mine but the ball has a small accident exactly like the one you had when you picked it up my sister and i nicked named the ball  booots its a joke from baldurs gate 2 with the gigantic minatare space hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling no boots as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over its done and now you are sad i would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion when it fits right you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life so you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how boots died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident after that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality 
final thing there are some that use 24 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3d environment such as 123d autocad and others but it also makes games such as mmorpgs fps and rts a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots especially the multiple sensor ones

so find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the dpi you want and never look back that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments
i love coverage like this id love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device for example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s a portable record player was one of my first repairs id be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then i suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts or vinyl enthusiasts but instead retirees whose entire music collection is in vinyl and are just happy to still be able to play what they have

i felt this way about a few of the items in this video and some recent videos i think its especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices

other than that youve done an amazing job as always and i cant wait to see the next one
thank you so much for giving us so much quality content and being so interesting you look like you had a fun time
this is a dream collab for a long time i watched you guys channels and appreciated you in every video but seeing you conquer the biggest electronic store together is such a nice surprise japan lifestyle carries both futuristic prospects and the relics of the past so any kind of video from there is bound to be the most interesting tech and lifestyle content
arun consistently amazes me with the incredible dedication and effort he puts into his videos his passion for technology shines through in every frame and its truly commendable the buying and reviewing tech series is without a doubt the best out there  his thorough insights engaging delivery and genuine excitement for the latest gadgets make each video an absolute delight to watch keep up

sorry for the confusion i made the list for myselfadded the games i interested with btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event you can look for them
the orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of oscars the flute guy especially man he absolutely nailed it
i loved hearing the alan wake director speak on both occassions he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching
12915 loved geoff keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the hello kitty game best moment for me
lets all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there what a legend
congratulations larian you absolutely deserve all these awards and more
congratulations to every other winnernominee as well

in all honesty bg3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo but im happy totk ff16 alan wake 2 and hifi rush won some awards as well would have been perfect if lies of p won best art direction
sami jrvi aka sam lake just is remedy entertainment
this guy is living his job 
performing the choriography with poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make
remedy pretty much never dissappoints
cheers
flute guy is the pillar of the game awards that absolutely everyone can get behind we may all like different games but our celebration of flute guy is unanimous
huge congratulations to neil newbon and all the other baldurs gate 3 makers you have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves
a game dev that is so committed to his game that he goes to an awards show in a suit of freaking armour kinda deserves the win huh keep making games larian

animation",1546,"something the character and the actor have in common we both suck at basic math hahaha loved these bits hope everyone else enjoys and will enjoy the last of what we made of sheriff hayseed
this style of todd is pretty neat
i love that clever detail where shawn has to lick his hoof in order to grab the card and pick it up 
todd popping his brain out over figuring out the basic math on the playing cards is absolutely mindblowing
its a shame this could never be completed but regardless this was wonderful
very cool animation as always hope that arm is feeling better
i dunno why but todd tapping the table 035 while trying to understand the game is weirdly adorable
piemations needs his own movie
hope you will recover from your wrist pain amazing animation as always
this wouldve looked like such an amazing show if it came to be
gee im gonna miss this show but putting your health first is something that we should all value the sake of entertainment isnt cheap thank you for creating such an awesome piece of animation
so this is the canonical ending todd tries to do basic maths and dies

i salute you sheriff hayseed you were fun whilst you lasted
super unique and stylized shame hayseed isnt gonna be finished 
for one side i get why it got canceled the artstyle is amazing and way too high effort for a small team to pull it out with out massive crutch but in the other side i would love seeing this getting a full budget and becoming yet another great youtube indie animated series
ill miss this guy hope your arm gets better eventually
love it pie i really dig the new style i know its been hard to animate with the pain in your wrists lately but you still did an awesome job with this kudos and looking forward to any new material you may put out going forward 
its really unfortunate that this got cancelled i love the animation and the style change looks really nice
its a shame the show is going on indeterminate hiatus i really like these twos chemistry

353 shaynes impressions
742 courtney freakin miller
1011 being cast in smosh
1646 when anthony came back
1752 sponsor
1932 the end of smosh
2504 imposter syndrome
2825 keeping smosh alive
3004 blooper",1935,"anthony telling shayne how important he is to smosh  how much he respects him is a major highlight shayne deserves his flowers
cant wait to see 20mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh
really happy to see where smosh is currently
i almost teared up when anthony at the end says that shayne has kept the true meaning of smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera its so true and thats what makes smosh so special especially the cast now you can see how close everyone is with each other and from ian and anthony to chance and angela the newest cast members everyone just puts a big smile on my face
come back next week for a new assumptions episode with openly gay pastors
members watch uncensored  ad free httpsyoutubecomanthonypadillajoin
man at the beginning when anthony started listing all the eras shayne went through i got so sad these people carried smosh through its darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old smosh shayne courtney damien etc truly are the unsung heroes of smosh
ill basically watch shayne do anything for any amount of time
i love this era of smosh smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter were now honoring smosh for everything theyve done and seeing how theyve become a giant family warms my heart what a time to be alive
shaynes depth as a human is what made me enjoy smosh more i remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is as someone else who loves reading and thinks it more than anything else can develop a person that was nice to see  hes genuine intelligent and over the top absurd love him
dearest shayne i cant tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on smosh this entire time we dont know what we would ever do without you you are not only hilarious but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member i see how invested you are in other people we all love you and please keep doing what youre doing
ian and anthony are the parents of main but pit and games are shaynes babies he really carried those channels for so long my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic woo shayne shayne it up
i actually really like the idea of interviewing smosh cast members
shayne is just such a pleasant person he seems so fun and nice to be around love seeing anthony and shayne together again the we bought smosh arc really is the best timeline
the way shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how i know he has the brain of an artist
him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome  deserves the world honestly
im glad that shayne is getting some flowers hes clearly a comedy powerhouse and very hardworking and loyal but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person im sure success will find him whatever he gets up to but im glad its smosh right now 
i respect everything that shane has done as he is my favorite cast member he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to smosh  has helped kept it alive alongside courtney  ian
not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but i feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way
im gonna be honest the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of shayne i find him the most funny comforting relatable and inspiring personality on the internet love you shayne
i dont know if shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry like i remember that scene of the office when jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives and we can see all that with shayne anthony and the rest of the smosh crew theyre all incredible people and its awesome to see how far they have all grown
the chosen and courtney freaking miller are two absolutely amazing characters and i get so excited every time i see them on screen ",27,Education,7580000,PT31M26S,"['anthony telling shayne how important smosh how much respect him major highlight shayne deserves his flower', 'cannot wait see 20mins shayne not_ being able take compliment', 'shayne such talent and been such great addition smosh', 'really happy see where smosh currently', 'almost teared when anthony the end say that shayne kept the true meaning smosh there all along just having fun with friend camera true and that what make smosh special especially the cast now you can see how close everyone with each other and from ian and anthony chance and angela the newest cast member everyone just put big smile face', 'come back next week for new assumption episode with openly gay pastor', 'member watch uncensored free', 'man the beginning when anthony started listing all the era shayne went through got sad these people carried smosh through darkest time but they were underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia old smosh shayne courtney damien etc truly are the unsung hero smosh', 'ill basically watch shayne anything for any amount time', 'love this era smosh smosh been pretty transparent and communicative towards fan and seeing all the ups and down the company make this moment much more sweeter were now honoring smosh for everything they have done and seeing how they have become giant family warms heart what time alive', 'shaynes depth human what made enjoy smosh more remember them showing his apartment one time and seeing how well read someone else who love reading and think more than anything else can develop person that nice see genuine intelligent and over the top absurd love him', 'dearest shayne cannot tell you how much mean everyone that you have stayed smosh this entire time not_ know what would ever without you you are not_ only hilarious but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting know each cast and crew member see how invested you are other people all love you and please keep doing what you are doing', 'ian and anthony are the parent main but pit and game are shaynes baby really carried those channel for long respect for him grew much during the pandemic woo shayne shayne', 'actually really like the idea interviewing smosh cast member', 'shayne just such pleasant person seems fun and nice around love seeing anthony and shayne together again the bought smosh arc really the best timeline', 'the way shayne describes the pride feel creating beloved character how know the brain artist', 'him being kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having imposter syndrome deserves the world honestly', 'glad that shayne getting some flower clearly comedy powerhouse and very hardworking and loyal but also just seems like genuinely kind person sure success will find him whatever get but glad smosh right now', 'respect everything that shane done favorite cast member multi talented individual that brought much smosh helped kept alive alongside courtney ian', 'not_ trying discredit the other team member who have helped with keeping the channel alive course but feel like having those people the forefront and all the sacrifice they made have paid off big way', 'going honest the only reason started watching smosh and still watch smosh because shayne find him the most funny comforting relatable and inspiring personality the internet love you shayne', 'not_ know shayne holding back tear but when speaking really made cry like remember that scene the office when jim say that the documentary people gave them the blessing being able actually look back into their life and can see all that with shayne anthony and the rest the smosh crew they are all incredible people and awesome see how far they have all grown', 'the chosen and courtney freaking miller are two absolutely amazing character and get excited every time see them screen']",1886

thanks to all of our gold level patrons marisa alfonso wendy tran traci lew matthew tadros",2594,"marissa and zach have the energy of two siblings determined to ruin each others days
the guys have come so far since the very first war episodes

proud to say i have survived another season

still one of my all time favorite shows to film 
you should have a flipped season where all the experts have to try to remake all the dumb shit the guys have invented but actually good
i still want a reverse war where they challenge 4 experts to make something without a recipe and the try guys judge them
one of the things that i think is really impressive about keith is that hes able to see when hes messed something up really badly toss it out and then make something to fill the gap that isnt perfect but works he might not be the best cook but hes got some genuine skill that just needs a recipe
i love the judges reactions when keith brought out his smores noelle was concerned but hopeful whilst jonny  rosanna were like oh god not again 
this is the first war where i vehemently disagree with the judges zach should not have come in 4th place over marissa whose marshmallow literally almost made a judge vomit out of all of the smores i wanted to try zachs the most i am happy that eugene won tho those tartlets looked so pretty 
johnny was fighting for all of the creations to be considered smores  that keith mouth comparison had me dying 
im absolutely living for eugenes fancy mellows
we clearly forget the rubric we have a rubric and we just say fck the rubric that line took me out  i love zach lol
i dont know why but when johnny said mama this is a smore made me smile because it reminds me of all the failed and ugly attempts ive had at making something and my aunts or older cousins would be like mama this is good you did good
keith and eugene bring fun and wholesome energy marissa and zach bring low key competitive siblings who are grasping at straws to finish the assignment
something about her sweet tone of voice gives rosanna the same energy as a kindergarten teacher trying to use gentle parenting techniques on a student who just brought a dead squirrel off the road for show and tell
only 10 seconds in and eugene willingly going in for a hug from keith  initiating it  has sent me to another plane of existence  so happy
eugene just happily and casually hugging keith and keith being surprised is just so wholesome considering eugene doesnt like being hugged 
eugene the one who made ro throw up comforting melissa the one who almost made ro throw up is so funny 
eugene helping keith this time how the tables have turned

the hugs and kisses from eugene at the beginning were so cute too

if blade turns out to be as good as dishonored 2 it will be a memorable experience being 100 singleplayer is a great start
i couldve shed a tear when they said itll be a thirdperson single player game

thank you arkane lyon
getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most blade thing ever
so glad that a gameplayfocused studio like arkane is doing blade some of the most fluid gunsword gameplay in the biz
perfect mix of character studio and platform
cant wait to see more of this
finally one of my favorite characters gets his own game i love the dark ominous feel that this has 3rd person single player too yes please
ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it i just get excited that someone is making blade
loving the art style already this is definitely going to be visually stunning
love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop it gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires
esto ser un gran juego gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
this a blade game is a fantastic idea this has so much potential the artstyle colour and lighting is astonishing the character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and blade looks like he came straight off the pages 

and the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed the elements of dishonoured and deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit blades combat and abilities out of the upcoming marvel games this is my favourite
glad to see blade gets a new game hopefully they will do the character justice fingers crossed
the fact that were getting the game before the movie is bizarre but im so excited i cant wait for it this looks so dope
esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos
vou voltar aqui todos os dias para apreciar essa obra de arte
muito interessanteaparentemente sera uma animao linda

shaking the spot like a ass or some

the simple fact jay even watched the flash is astonishing
jay is jealous of how many cats mike flanigan is able to kill compared to him
i believe wes anderson could make a very very unsettling surreal horror movie
i just wanted to see babies falling out of skyscrapers  jay bauman 2023
timestamps
000 beginning
3921 end
jays genuine no when asked if hed want a fake dead cat was so adorable 3508 esp since he had two alive cats
jay is steadily draining the life of mike and rich in his quest for everlasting youth
even when jay doesnt remember a thing about a movie he still remembers more than mike
the killer is actually based on an indie comic by luc jacamon from the mid 00s  i realized as jay was walking through that narrative description and its crazy to think that comic actually got an adaptation so many years later i remember stumbling across an animated version of the first issue years ago on a site called flashtv and grabbing the first collected book of it a year or two later  if indie comics from that era are finally getting their turn for filmseries adaptations then hopefully some of my favorites will get some attention like the warren ellis series global frequency
yes jay they did get michael shannon for the flash and he publicly admitted it was a bullshit role in the nicest way possible by saying it wasnt very satisfying and likening it to being an action figure as opposed to a character
we need another show where jay talks to his cat about the latest sexpervert films
i love judy greer being in everything  her face and voice are instantly recognizable so regardless of the character she plays she feels like a reoccurring character that travels from movie to movie 
mike asking jay if he wants one of the dead prop cats was actually just him trying to fish for christmas gift ideas
people talk about paul rudd looking good for his age but hes got nothing on barbara crampton 64 years young and still an absolute knockout
but then do they fight zod in the middle of the desert for 45 minutes should be a standard question when reviewing great movies
im happy to see jay liked the killer some viewers complained about the movie feeling like an empty technical exercise but the sly sense of humor where its constantly poking fun at the assassin and poking holes in his neurotic precision and need for control was the extra layer that made the movie work for me
this has to be the most positive half in the bag episode ever
i like that george lucas in the phantom menace pioneered the technology to be able to split actors from different takes and composite them together so that decades later mike could wag his finger at a zombified jay

my first time seeing two meteorologists giving the weather report at the same time  lots of storms coming in be safe everybody
im shocked winter weather during winter 
i live in the snow belt of western new york state and it is in the 50s good luck snow is something that happens every winter have fun freezing if your furnace runs on electricity  i have wood and natural gas
praying for everyones safety
stay safe and warm 
i dont like it when gets  to hot or to darn cold
its winter we have bad weather sometimes we used to have it without fearmongering i miss those days
i am convinced theres gonna be weather its coming whatever it is and theres gonna be a lot of it until it stops
there is always so much drama with weather forecast over the last few years i live in an area they are showing violent weather threats which is surprising the local weather and noaa seem to know nothing about it maybe the ne is going to experience a winter nor easter but there isnt anything threatening in the south
im in an rv in east texas with solar panels so hail and wind  are bad 
i like fox but the freaking out over winter weather like its the first time theres ever been bad weather in the winter is silly
potentially enormous cyclone set to hit australia next week too
how does it feel giving a weather report when you know they are manipulating the weather does it throw a kink in everything you learned
i live in the eastern mountain range this weather has been very antisnow this year every time it cools it is dry and every time it warms up it rains 1 day of snow so far which melted in less than 3 hrs pre2010 having 4 months of periodic snow was common post2020 we barely have any snow ive seen global warming in my lifetime by simply looking out my window
is the mountains of north carolina going to be impacted with the raincold and possible chance of snow
texas its almost clear sky and sunny with only few clouds very spaced 
ive always found the weather reporting  meteorologist to be comical
oh how coincidental right on time for the anniversary of the december 10 2021 tornado that hit dawson springs ky and took the life of my father the longest track tornado in kentucky history

which characters are you hoping to see on the roster
who else is ready for one of the biggest and best fighting experiences to date rip all controllers
its like the fusion of dbz kakarot and dbfz in terms of animation  this is gonna be 
please i hope we get a huge roster like the old games and they dont lock a bunch of them behind paywalls
its absolutely crucial to feature local multiplayer for a fighting game not having this is a deal breaker for many people myself included i have so many great couch memories with the old tenkaichi 2 and 3 split screen battles  please make it happen
ive played budokai tenkaichi literally most of my life and now were finally getting another one we are so back
dont lock characters behind dlc and pay wallslet us unlock the roster
im hoping theyll have a lot of og db characters on the roster would love to play as piccolo jr or kid goku from the path to power movie
i find myself constantly rewatching this trailer in disbelief that a new budokai tenakichi is being made its crazy i still have play bt3 and rb2 to this day and a another is actually being made its soo surreal man thank god i lived to see this
no wonder why they took so long they wanted to make sure they did it right  incredible
no words can express
how much i been waiting for a entry in the budokai series in a very long time without this series i wouldnt have been a fan of dragon ball z or anime in general
ive genuinely done nothing but cry this past 2 days

i just cant stop thinking about this being alive to experience tenkaichis return and it being so glorious
ive been watching this trailer at least twice a day since it was announced its amazing and i hope its well worth the wait
this trailer showed me almost everything i need to know about the game play to be excited but please dont forget one of the things that made tenkaichi special was the uniquely cinematic character intros and the roster that included faces even harcore fans occasionally forget 

seeing bergamo helped but i would love to see this roster include more dragon ball and dragon ball gt characters like jackie chun king chappa ledgic and goku jr
i really hope they go all out on this for roster tenkaichi 3 was so crazy i want everyone from the pilaf gang and grandpa gohan to meta rildo and orange piccolo if the character has thrown a punch i want them in
better have a hercule with infinite combo like in budokai tenkaichi 2
also 12 arcade mode like in 2 or 3 would be awesome

wwwjurassicparksurvivalcom",6126,"holy cow not only is it a jurassic park game instead of jurassic world to change it up but its a an official survival horror game weve been wanting for years 
if this is anything like alien isolation then were in for the biggest treat ever man i love that theyre going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place
its incredible how jurassic park has a different sense of tension than jurassic world
yes finally ive been waiting for something like this for years 
to me the ford explorer and jeep wrangler will forever be the real heroes of jurassic park takes me right back to my childhood
i cant believe theyre making an actual jurassic park survival horror game this looks incredible the attention to level of detail eg the ford explorer the jeep wrangler the dinosaurs i like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of jurassic park

hopefully this game doesnt disappoint
ive always wanted a jurassic park game like this
as a huge dino fan this is something im eyeing the most to come out i dont care how short or long i can tell im going to throughly enjoy this
the original islandthe original park this feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90s i dont even play new games anymore but im really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan  
it seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now  it looks promising 
ive been imagining a game like this for about 20 years they finally made one
ive never wanted anything more in my life i knew they were gonna do something like this at some point so happy to finally see it
this is what ive been wanting from jurassic park
the makers of jurassic world must take note from this game this is what a true jurassic movie should look and feel like we need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies
what i would really like in the game jurassic park survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993 it would be completely crazy for example we have the proceratosaurus the metriacanthosaurus the segisaurus herrerasaurus and the baryonyx this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of jurassic park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film it allows us to fill a void 
im going to need more gameplay footage  looks suspiciously like a jumpscare funhouse walk and look adventure
this looks incredible already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay thanks for sharing this trailer
the musicthe scenesthe dinossame place everything is on point i bet playing this will feel like a jurassic park sequel but you are in it
look at how much love went into making this trailer i havent felt the magic this strongly since the first movie

que viva sin poder sentir tu calor

recib la noticia que vienes
estoy muy ansiosa por verte
en mi mente te veo y te siento
ya quiero en mis brazos tenerte 
t tienes todo lo que quiero y yo
muero porque me cambies el mood
si yo pudiera te dara tototodoo 

quiz tuviste un problemn al momento de llegar
no s quin cometi el error pero se pudo superar
quiz tuviste un problemn al momento de llegar
no s quin cometi el error pero

gingerbread dollhouse upcycling",1392,"when you said what would christine mcconnell do i thought shed probably bake individual shingles out of gingerbread each with a unique design copied directly from historicallyaccurate examples of victorian wallpaper but with her own spooky spin of including a bat or a mouse in the corner of each only visible with a magnifying glass that shecast out of poured sugar and then i got tired just from thinking about the work that goes into her and your projects and got a snack
if you put the piping tip inside the snipped bag before you fill it with icing and then it stays in place while you pipe 3
welcome to a rachel maksy video where we all ask ourselves what will she turn brown today with the occasional green thing    it turned out great  also try putting the icing tip inside the baggie
my 2 year old just said that is a cute house 

you have the toddler seal of approval 
i feel like this is the home of the queen to whom your lil mouse knight pledges allegiance 
you could display your gingerbread house on your porch for the season i think it would be cute it turned out great by the way the appropriate amount of whimsy
tip if you ever find yourself doing icing like this again cut a hole in the pastry bagsandwich bag and put the tip inside the bag so the tip of it comes out the hole then twist the bag above the icingcaulk and squeeze with your hand on top of the bulb of icingcaulk youll get more control this way and wont have to hold the tip in place this is how i was taught to ice cakecookies when i worked in a bakery 
you made a sweet gingerbread hostel for all of your felt creatures to slumber for winter  love it so much
the idea of rachel being like ah yes i will do a small project a little gingerbread house and then receiving a huge castle is so funny

rachaels reaction to the size of the dollhouse was my reaction to every project i undertake super simple no problems at oh my gosh so relatable and delightful
next step make each room victorian themed and make miniatures 
i just started watching and i am so filled with affection for rachel looking completely overwhelmed by the size of this monstrosity and yet also giddy with the prospect of gingerbreadifying it rachel maksy patron saint of chaotic crafters 3
you took a dna test and bob is in fact your uncle  the gingerbread house turned out so cute
tip for the windows
a lot of people will use sheets of gelatin as the glass in real gingerbread houses 
the peppermint pattyo was a stroke of genius  love it
as someone who is a baker but also does decoden heres some tips  the icing tip goes inside of the bag lol you cut the tip of the bag off put the icing tip inside and then put your silicone in the bag you can twist the top of the bag rubber band it zip tie it etc to keep the silicone from oozing out the top and it also gives you more control of the bag with applying pressure  if you ever want to add color to your silicone you can use mica or oil based paint no waterbased colors because it will cause the silicone to seize up and then you cant pipe it
if rachel and nick ever chose to have kids they are gonna have the most whimsical childhoods
this is becoming such a cool trend i drove to another province to pick up one of these houses with my friend back in october so she could make an awesome haunted house for halloween it turned out amazing i love how this is catching on 
rachaels response to the dollhouses size mirrored my own feelings toward each project i work on extremely easy no issues at all oh my god so enjoyable and relatable",24,Entertainment,1200000,PT18M57S,"['when you said what would christine mcconnell thought she would probably bake individual shingle out gingerbread each with unique design copied directly from historicallyaccurate example victorian wallpaper but with her own spooky spin including bat mouse the corner each only visible with magnifying glass that shecast out poured sugar and then got tired just from thinking about the work that into her and your project and got snack', 'you put the piping tip inside the snipped bag before you fill with icing and then stay place while you pipe', 'welcome rachel maksy video where all ask ourselves what will she turn brown today with the occasional green thing turned out great also try putting the icing tip inside the baggie', 'year old just said that cute house', '', 'you have the toddler seal approval', 'feel like this the home the queen whom your lil mouse knight pledge allegiance', 'you could display your gingerbread house your porch for the season think would cute turned out great the way the appropriate amount whimsy', 'tip you ever find yourself doing icing like this again cut hole the pastry bagsandwich bag and put the tip inside the bag the tip come out the hole then twist the bag above the icingcaulk and squeeze with your hand top the bulb icingcaulk you will get more control this way and will not_ have hold the tip place this how taught ice cakecookies when worked bakery', 'you made sweet gingerbread hostel for all your felt creature slumber for winter love much', 'the idea rachel being like yes will small project little gingerbread house and then receiving huge castle funny', 'friend here all the info for june journey once more', 'download june journey for free now using link', 'and purchase the june journey interactive diary here', 'giveaway form will closed after hour', '', 'rachaels reaction the size the dollhouse reaction every project undertake super simple problem gosh relatable and delightful', 'next step make each room victorian themed and make miniature', 'just started watching and filled with affection for rachel looking completely overwhelmed the size this monstrosity and yet also giddy with the prospect gingerbreadifying rachel maksy patron saint chaotic crafter', 'you took dna test and bob fact your uncle the gingerbread house turned out cute', 'tip for the window', 'lot people will use sheet gelatin the glass real gingerbread house', 'the peppermint pattyo stroke genius love', 'someone who baker but also doe decoden here some tip the icing tip inside the bag lol you cut the tip the bag off put the icing tip inside and then put your silicone the bag you can twist the top the bag rubber band zip tie etc keep the silicone from oozing out the top and also give you more control the bag with applying pressure you ever want add color your silicone you can use mica oil based paint waterbased color because will cause the silicone seize and then you cannot pipe', 'rachel and nick ever chose have kid they are going have the most whimsical childhood', 'this becoming such cool trend drove another province pick one these house with friend back october she could make awesome haunted house for halloween turned out amazing love how this catching', 'rachaels response the dollhouse size mirrored own feeling toward each project work extremely easy issue all god enjoyable and relatable']",1137

 jump over walls
dig  pass under walls
crush walls in seconds
fly over walls

and supercell be likethe new level wall costs 9 million coins per wall

isnt it funny how the cost of leveling up walls increases and the amount of troops with special abilities to go through walls also increases 
as a th11 i can confidently say that ill be excited for this update in around a decade
its amazing how far coc has come even after 10 years i still have so much fun playing this game
they really made attacking at th15 more userfriendly by introducing an op new troop dang

super wall breaker would be vanished from th 16 in some extent  
but loved to see new troop at new townhall
i expect a nerf coming soon even though its not yet officially released this new troop is definitely overpowered 
i feel like a lot of older troops are left out valkyrie is an apparent one but pekka is also significantly downgraded once electro titan is announced they should make a buff to the unusable troops
this new troop is truly amazing i cant wait to try it i see it as a little slow but they have unstoppable power
the troop is pretty interesting it seems kind of op at this moment it adds so much value to a hero dive without taking much space also seems superior to a lot of popular troops like electro titans and hogs interesting to see how it works out seems like it could break th 15 a bit
i cant wait to see the root rider dominate in pro games
i think that the apprentice warden is going to pair really well with it it boosts its health so much and if im not wrong it can jump over walls if not root riders will break them anyways 
the extra hp will be of great value especially if u use a qc root rider attack
for the ones who noticed two icons above the king 

new blacksmith building is coming to have different abilities for heroes
upcoming sneak peak i think it will be on our heroes ability charging option or somethingmore cooler
 i am so much excited before seeing it 
i liked the troop but i think they could have game her a better ability with the root manipulation concept like using the roots to force stop defenses for limited amount of time
i think they are kinda bad due to their low dps they are more like pseudo tank that crushes walls along the way and isnt prone to spring traps so i can see them being used instead of ice golems sometimes i think their best use case would be with super bowler smash since you would be able to use it without jump due to how good they are at breaking walls
always my first stop for all the new update information thanks judo all of the videos as always are well designed and very informative you and the other content creators are as much a part of the game as the game itself keep it up my friend
honestly i feel like ive really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through an attack strategy with basic commentary keep it up judo
to add to what judo said about using super wall breakers for king pathing the root riders are just a normal troop whereas the super wall breaker is a super troop so you dont have use your dark elixir or super potion im definitely looking forward to this troop ",20,Gaming,2730000,PT9M1S,"['troop can', 'jump over wall', 'dig pas under wall', 'crush wall second', 'fly over wall', '', 'and supercell likethe new level wall cost million coin per wall', '', 'not_ funny how the cost leveling wall increase and the amount troop with special ability through wall also increase', 'th11 can confidently say that ill excited for this update around decade', 'amazing how far coc come even after year still have much fun playing this game', 'they really made attacking th15 more userfriendly introducing new troop dang', 'subscribe for all the update sneak peek which root rider strategy will you use', '', 'town hall playlist', 'super wall breaker would vanished from some extent', 'but loved see new troop new townhall', 'expect nerf coming soon even though not_ yet officially released this new troop definitely overpowered', 'feel like lot older troop are left out valkyrie apparent one but pekka also significantly downgraded once electro titan announced they should make buff the unusable troop', 'this new troop truly amazing cannot wait try see little slow but they have unstoppable power', 'the troop pretty interesting seems kind this moment add much value hero dive without taking much space also seems superior lot popular troop like electro titan and hog interesting see how work out seems like could break bit', 'cannot wait see the root rider dominate pro game', 'think that the apprentice warden going pair really well with boost health much and not_ wrong can jump over wall not_ root rider will break them anyways', 'the extra will great value especially you use root rider attack', 'for the one who noticed two icon above the king', '', 'new blacksmith building coming have different ability for hero', 'upcoming sneak peak think will our hero ability charging option somethingmore cooler', 'much excited before seeing', 'liked the troop but think they could have game her better ability with the root manipulation concept like using the root force stop defense for limited amount time', 'think they are kind bad due their low they are more like pseudo tank that crush wall along the way and not_ prone spring trap can see them being used instead ice golem sometimes think their best use case would with super bowler smash since you would able use without jump due how good they are breaking wall', 'always first stop for all the new update information thanks judo all the video always are well designed and very informative you and the other content creator are much part the game the game itself keep friend', 'honestly feel like have really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through attack strategy with basic commentary keep judo', 'add what judo said about using super wall breaker for king pathing the root rider are just normal troop whereas the super wall breaker super troop you not_ have use your dark elixir super potion definitely looking forward this troop']",541

jack harlow was smooth and held his own and dave gotta be one of the most sickest rappers to walk the earth
dave has literally mastered rapping at whatever pace he chooses so relaxed and smooth man
dave is properly a master at the verses that go on for ages this is probably the best song ive heard from jack too
shout out to all the loan survivors 
uk rappers are finally getting love in the us it took way too long but anyone who hasnt been following uk grime and drill is going to be surprised at the talent thats been overlooked
harlow went fucking crazy one of his top tracks for sure 
dave is genuinely an expert at the lengthy verses i think this is jacks best song yet as well
jacks really following his mentors footsteps with this level of consistency he is really going places
man jacks progression is crazy
jackdave never disappoints
they both slid this beat is absolutely perfect on the ears i wouldnt mind a collaboration album from these two dave is that guy 
both artists ending the year with an absolute banger
the collab we didnt know we needed blown away both went crazy
dope bars from both artists the end of year collabo we didnt expect
cant get over how well this video is shot videography  editing on another level huge props to cole and the crew
this is so fire artists need to make more songs like this
jacks best verse by far well done dave snapped as usual

i lost my wife earlier this year she would have loved this song i shed tears of somberness and loneliness this christmas thank you for releasing this song simon
xg is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained  honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly
what an instant bop for this season
xg brings soul back in music they sing with their heart every word they say every note they sing every choreo there are soulful sincere message in it i hope they keep on doing what they doing they are making the right choice there are a lot of us who understand real music talented artists weve been waiting for a group like you our whole life the fanbase keeps getting bigger i saw new reactors everyday they been saying you are their favorite group so keep going xg hesono ooooo
they really need to play this on radio in all over the us
my great grandpa passed away in october its been really hard for me and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this christmas thanks xg for your amazing new song 
i wish xg would release a full length album with 1314 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts
the gals need some radio play for this song its such a good song and deserves more people to know before christmas
toda vez que escuto novamente meu corao vibra de uma maneira diferente obrigada xg 
i lost my mom this year this song made me think of her since she loved christmas 
the more i listened to the song the more it hit harder also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated christmas for so long because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that this song was so meaningful thank you xg xgalx the creators behind it so much for making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young  and yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 



its sad how underrated this group is
they slayed every genre
not only noisy music and dances
cocos voice so warm and smooth  i can listen to her forever 
jurias make me emotional
mayas and hinatas voices are so pretty im happy they did a lot of singing here
chisa always killing it
jurins and harveys parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time

love them sooo sooo much
i really want to meet the person who produceswrites their stuff it is so authentically american 90s to early 2000s rb its crazy kpop often chases black culture awkwardly but these girls truly pay so much hommage to it in such an authentic way its so amazingly beautiful also harveythat outfit at 333  i cant girl stopplease my heart 
the beauty of the song the amazing vocals the rap production the beautiful harmonies everything is perfect
this song deserves more attention xg is such a talented group theyre better than the most of popular groups

manchesterunited mufc",1289,"scary thing is this wasnt even the worst performance of the season they have played worse against teams and won
onanas shot stopping comparison is a trex   literally no arms
mark last week ten hag masterclass
mark this week we are a disgrace

chelsea had an awful game last game it wasnt that man utd were amazing it was the fact that chelsea had the worst performance of their season
we lost fair and square to a better team
its very simple chelsea didnt play as well as this team did today so manchester looked good
thought chelsea and today were similar performances conceded a load of chances in both and looked on front foot chelsea couldnt finish but bournemouth could long way to go for this team manager still makes same mistakes picking certain players every game
congrats goldbridge on predicting 30 scoreline
mark has lost ittalking about inconsistency we have been good in one game this season at home to chelsea its factual defending this manager is incomprehensible
threw the game they dont want ten hag and they showed it and your captain doesnt want to play liverpool imagine robson doing that
what have you actually seen from ten hag to suggest hes the right man like hes not won multiple champions leagues and dominated a top league before like a klopp or guardiola i agree half the team needs clearing out but its also entirely possible he isnt up to the job either im genuinely shocked at how tactically naive he is and how unable he is able to actually address glaring issues in the set up
well probably beat bayern 

never learn goldbridge never learn 
its baffling how you draw conclusions based on only looking at the performance of one team bournemouth outplayed villa last week and palace in the week this result was no surprise to a lot of bournemouth fans and it makes it more funny when you predicted an easy 30 win without doing the simplest most cursory homework on your opposition up the cherries 
our captains accidental yellow card
its almost ridiculous to say we played brilliantly against chelsea if we had played against city or liverpool instead of chelsea that day we would have conceded at least 5 goals still eth out
i dont understand how you can believe this team can beat bayern on tuesday and at the same time not recognise that the manager is likely to be the most culpable  he chose the captain and he carries responsibility for motivating the team  if you think the players are good enough to beat bayern then it seems to me that we must have the quality but not the leadership  personally i think we lack passion and aggression too many prima donnas on the pitch and no roy keane to remind them what the job is during the game
onana is the biggest problem hes simply 5 inches shorter than he should be the other problem is the utter failure to find a manu standard number 9 van persie was probably the last one
ive come to realise that shaw cant play lcb without varane there to guide him

whoever plays with varane looks good because hes such a good organiser and reader of the game
eth has made a lot of mistakes not handling players like he should overpaying and bringing in mediocre footballers overtraining players hence our long injury list no clear tactics its like weve got an identity crisis he was never the right manager to begin with give klopp or pep 400 million and theyll buy league winning players eth has no pulling power its just the brand doing everything were done this guy needs to go

lyrics
she wanna ride with the star
ended up dropping my top ok
my ex told me she needed space
i guess we both going to mars ok
i cannot forget the base
im taking my mop on my dates ok
just look at the look on they faces
they wanna jump in my place ok
told shorty she was the one
but im taking her friends out to tan ok
i told em to load up the dock
but they wanna ride in my benz ok
one of one this a new cullinan
no telling when im a stand ok
aint counting no more dubs again
only fucking with the benjamins ok

straight off of plane to these racks
we gon stunt to the vibes
and we gon keep it going lets go
i through a fit in rick owens ok
momma the shit and she know how she be
aint just talking i got it for sure i dont play
send a boarding pass when she get bored come play
come hop in the urus we touring you
keep it low they know that its roaring
went ceramic the audemar blue 6v
they aint brought em out yet these the new ones
having motion dont ask what im doing
tryna see if she pretty she going
haters hate thats their job they gonna do it
i wear white air force ones the louie
tell a bitch she fumble she blew it
bro aint do it if the lawyer dont prove it
she delusional making up shit in her head and believing it

she wanna ride with the star
ended up dropping my top ok
my ex told me she needed space
i guess we both going to mars ok
i cannot forget the base
im taking my mop on my dates ok
just look at the look on they faces
they wanna jump in my place ok
told shorty she was the one
but im taking her friends out to tan ok
i told em to load up the dock
but they wanna ride in my benz ok
one of one this a new cullinan
no telling when im a stand ok
aint counting no more dubs again
only fucking with the benjamins ok

made 100 mill and took over the street
with no sponsor man
coming through customs
flying through cali
they checking the jet for the contraband
brought out the coupe
shorty got grouped out
told lil bitch to stay off the gram
dont be the first to get hit with that drako
soulja boy or that aubrey graham dont be playing
she holla at the moon i be barking
i am a goon she a goblin
coke boy like loon up in harlem
ramadan but we aint starving
came out the mud on my own
thats word to rick i dont owe em
shoot your shooter out his zone
so rich they think i got clone

she wanna ride with the star
ended up dropping my top ok
my ex told me she needed space
i guess we both going to mars ok
i cannot forget the base
im taking my mop on my dates ok

minecraft secretlife",874,"the fact that i watched cleos pov first and nothing  grian did struck out of the ordinary other than when grian asked etho what he ate for breakfast i thought that was weird but nothing else until i saw this
jimmy somehow manages to weasel his way back in 
out of everyone to be paired together jimmy with grian is the best because now jimmy can torment grian freely
jimmy and grian are such brothers i swear i love seeing them interact and seeing jimmy get so excited to mess with grian is always so funny
ethos task must have been jimmy is telling grian what to do act as if everything is completely normal
this is honestly such a good representation of jimmys quick wit every sort of situation grian was in he managed to find something hilarious for him to do
grian sounded really panicked  as soon as he found out lol 
 the ghosts all stay above the clouds and watch 
whoa jimmy you just created lore
this is the furthest that jimmy has ever made it in a life series he may not be there in physical form but hes there in spirit
i like how timmy tries to embarrass grian but it backfires
the absolute sheer joy jimmy had doing this is absolutely making my day
forcing someone to be weird on this server literally has no effect  people have been weird since day one  ethos first episode here was titled server full of weirdos
i would love to see a future installment of the life series use a gimmick where dead players can stick around as guardian angels for the living players
when the world needed him the most he came back
funny how the secret keeper allowed jimmy back as a ghost instead of letting rejoin in a different name with a mustache just like in the hardcore series grian did with scar and joel 
seeing an episode from spectator mode is actually really fun not to mention this particular task was fantastic
knowing ethos strategy has been to do weird things so people couldnt guess his task he probably just assumed grian was doing the same thing on top off etho just being a chill person in general and not minding other peoples business too much
the leaves are all pointing upward
etho and cleo appear out of nowhere
kinda cute that jimmy used grian to woof at martyn from beyond the grave
observation jimmy spent most of the time just kinda playing around with grian but the instant genuine danger gets presented to him he drops the light tone and warns him

its actually nice to see vivek and ron treat each other well on the debate stage
this has to be the best debate compared to the other 3 they actually debated and spoke on important policiesissues
its wild that if you google vivek right now you see every media outlet slamming his performance and even one site stating a pole that he was voted the worst performer at this debate yet you come to the comments and get the complete opposite lol they are going to do everything to keep him out because they are scared its hilarious yet also terrifying and sad to see vivek 2024
vivek had me literally dying of laughter making fun of haleys blank stare when asked about which 3 provinces in ukraine we should be protecting
vivek is just too good thats how a world leaders should be  america is lucky to have such a brilliant candidate big w for him
vivek is savage and i absolutely love it hes the only one on that stage who is not robotic
vivek knows all the subject matter that president should know and no one can get past him
vivek won  hands down  hes crystal clear with his ideas
vivek crushed it i like desantis a lot too the moderators are obviously bias and against vivek
vivek is actually super impressive he must have read a large library of information you can hear it when he speaks
vivek makes more sense than others
vivek is spot on  tells it like it is and sometimes truth hurts no more american tax payer dollars for foreign wars
desantis and vivek teaming up on haley has to be one of my favorite things ive seen all week
good lord christy is acting like a moderator and time keeper
vivek is too much he is exactly what america needs and everyone on that stage should be supporting him and his wisdom instead of fighting him or being against him i believe desantis now gets that i see the two being the only ones remaining on the last stage and vivek will win congratulations vivek a voice and a true leader for the young generation of america 
thank you newsnation for making this available to everyone great job on questions and monitoring the debate
vivek dominated again congrats vivek

new ecosystems new creatures a mount that lets you glide from high falls everything from this trailer brought me joy and i absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar
so excited  
this is what i always wanted to see in monster hunter large flocks of animals more ambiant megafauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs

it will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem cant wait to see what they cook up for us
as a fiver it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of monster hunter i am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
ill let it speak for itself is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement you know that monster hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds
the amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster and rath ofc is actually stunning to me didnt think they had it in them
seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment as well as one another has got me feeling the same giddiness i had seeing the monster hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time this franchise is in my blood man
one of my friends got me into mh back when world was announced i played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hours combined later this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time heres to hunting with everyone in 2025 lets go
heres the most anticipated game for me until it comes out very hard to top it from my list 
mhw have such a special place in my gamer heart
this looks amazing it gives me very open worldish vibes i would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting exploring and researching kinda vibe
the little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic
from that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in the synth stuff being used is really new to mh or at least it hasnt had a very large presence they mainly kept to orchestration

but all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme

truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack
mhw was my first introductory into the franchise it became and still remains my favorite game ever and i started at the base nintendo system this game just brought joy to my heart
love the little bit they showed here the movement feels like a mix of worlds more methodical speed and rises more open verticallity
i absolutely loved worlds ecosystem simulation and i absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game
i thought you couldnt get better than the palamutes i was so wrong though the mounts different movement types kinda make me think of koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mounts from scarlet and violet its a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great i love this creature and i want twelve of them
bro when i was going into the game awards i had the lowest of low expectationsbut then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interestedand then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me i am hyped beyond belief even if 2025 is quite a long wait i am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon
i want them to bring back 16 person hubs so much more lively for my 712 person groups it felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world
one of my friends got me into monster hunter my first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cant wait to see what the new game brings 
im reaching that phase in my life where i really dont feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited ",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S,"['hunter take care yourselves all make 2025 and play this amazing game together', 'new ecosystem new creature mount that let you glide from high fall everything from this trailer brought joy and absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this stellar', 'excited', 'this what always wanted see monster hunter large flock animal more ambiant megafauna and large monster type being able encountered hunting pack', '', 'will feel lot more like massive ecosystem cannot wait see what they cook for', 'fiver really surreal experience here for the next generation monster hunter absolutely stoked see what store for', 'ill let speak for itself one the best thing you could say game announcement you know that monster hunter iconic that player could immediately recognize second', 'the amount restraint they had only showing one new large monster and rath course actually stunning did not_ think they had them', 'seeing the way the small monster interact with the environment well one another got feeling the same giddiness had seeing the monster hunter test footage mounting and climbing wall for the first time this franchise blood man', 'one friend got into back when world announced played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hour combined later this the most exciting announcement for such long time here hunting with everyone 2025 let', 'here the most anticipated game for until come out very hard top from list', 'mhw have such special place gamer heart', 'this look amazing give very open worldish vibe would love see monster hunter move more towards this style that really push the boundary true hunting exploring and researching kind vibe', 'the little bit soundtrack get this trailer just legitimately fantastic', 'from that deep synth bass the start which then punctuated some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral part kicking the synth stuff being used really new least not_ had very large presence they mainly kept orchestration', '', 'but all that leading into what very quickly becoming favorite rendition the proof heroesque leit motif that each game get main theme', '', 'truly excited for this game and hear more soundtrack', 'mhw first introductory into the franchise became and still remains favorite game ever and started the base nintendo system this game just brought joy heart', 'love the little bit they showed here the movement feel like mix world more methodical speed and rise more open verticallity', 'absolutely loved world ecosystem simulation and absolutely cannot wait see what they with this game', 'thought you could not_ get better than the palamutes wrong though the mount different movement type kind make think koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mount from scarlet and violet great concept already and seeing put use beautifully here great love this creature and want twelve them', 'bro when going into the game award had the lowest low expectationsbut then few game trailer came out actually got quite interestedand then this came the very last moment and stole the show for hyped beyond belief even 2025 quite long wait more than willing wait for this masterpiece come soon', 'want them bring back person hub much more lively for 712 person group felt more dynamic and lot fun when had that freedom monster hunter world', 'one friend got into monster hunter first game world and have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cannot wait see what the new game brings', 'reaching that phase life where really not_ feel like investing much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited']",91

a tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
this is an awesome turn for the channel and they dont even always have to be death matches they could be races to loot or securing an area team death matches would be a treat too
the animation team did a fantastic job and congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
as an animator myself ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew  theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics ive seen hollywood do far worse

props allround  super keen to see more of these styles of videos
as someone who loved watching the most extreme as a kid on animal planet i appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly the only thing missing was the music used in the show
dang the fight choreography was so good all the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging the cat noticing the raptor the bluffing the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points

such good work
i didnt realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content incredible work
the animation on this episode is exceptional kudos to kuzim and wobblyworks
ive always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a cg character believable and id say this is proof of that
i love this so much as a big fan of the iconic animal face off series back in the day its nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback awesome stuff as always
the animations here are crazy cool  hoping to see more in the future
this channel has been great the whole time its existed and the skill going into production has been increasing thanks for existing
im a longtime fan of kuzims art and its so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel
wow such a good pilot this gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on tv but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe congratulations to the whole team

i just missed your gaming guide style of writing this one was professional succinct and great but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction
sadly i dont think these videos will hit your normal view count but please dont stop making them the series from this would be amazing and will blow up great job on the animation from your team
at first i was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality fearing they finally dropped the ball on outsides legendary graphics but then i realized this is a user made mod made from scratch not bad at all and a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing would love to see more content in this mod
2 years well spent this is amazing truly top tier content every single time tierzoo just doesnt disappoint
the step up in animation is phenomenal cant wait to see what you do with it next

no way new hellogames game

i love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that nms trailers usually are
cant wait for this looks beautiful
the fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very very good thing thats a sign that theyre aiming for density on a much smaller scale despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
i genuinely cannot wait  you guys are some of the hardest working devs around and i really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making nms an incredible game im more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything i love in one game so excited
seeing how far theyve come with nms compared to its initial release makes this game very promising even if its not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning we no theyre 100 capable of making it better over time
as a nms player since day one im all in for light no fire
after the eventual epic success of nms hello games is now one of the few game developers i trust to deliver i cant wait to explore this world
having witnessed the commitment they have shown to no mans sky im all in on this also no mans sky on psvr2 is insane
i like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year i am genuinely excited for this i can see this being a huge improvement from nms for the simple reason its just one world which they can build on density
love the artstyle looks really interesting and after delivering nms you really deserve that this will be a success
what im hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards and some kind of engaging story if they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
everything about this is pure vibes the atmosphere the track selection for the video the editing very well done cannot wait to play this
i dont even know how i feel no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre and you guys delivered that  cant wait
i just want to say im a huge fan of your guys work you guys put passion first and money second unlike the vast majority of companies today

were all sad that you left the private lifesteal smp but we are all happy to see you still thrive in other sectors and most importantly in the public lifesteal server ive always loved your videos and their unique styleofc with a bit of rekrap charm and  ill keep watching them no matter what

im rewatching echocraft and it seems rek has always been this good
rek is really the most passiveaggresive minecrafter ever

rekrap immediately attempts to block glitch
mannn that was so fun your base looks so cool i really hope no one finds it from this video thatd be unfortunate xd
very cool video fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one
rekrap2 just wanted to let you know since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the target block and target fluid on the bottom right since they show exact coords
rekrap2 just letting you know if you want to properly blur your coordinates you also need to blur the chunk coordinates which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks edit after trying to figure out if you gave info away i have found that you did block it sorry
seeing rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
hey rek its amazing to see how much youve grown over the past couple of years form ecocraft to lifesteal then the race to 1m with parrot then to commentary speed runs hoplite and so much other amazing content thank you so much for entertaining me over the years
im so happy that you made this video i enjoy watching these types of  thanks rek keep up the good work 
watching secret life has made me extra anxious watching anyone playing on a server i especially skipped a beat when the meteor dropped on your head lol
edit this was a really fun video
you have to make this a series its soo good
i cant wait to see more of this looks super cool would like to play but starting late is rough
this was really fun to watch those poi and the unique mechanics were great

garnachos goal is absolutely momentous honouring the clubs icons fr well done
garnacho scoring like rooney celebrating like ronaldo and being from messis country is pure football magic
i bet garnacho is watching the clip back  a million times and continuously smiling at himself  what a goal 
got garnachos goal on replay kid has all the potential in the world 
bruno giving rashy the pk was class 
great finish from martial very composed 
having shaw and mainoo back is a breath of fresh air
we have to keep this kid at all costs not every player can score a bicycle kick but to score it in the 2nd minute like its nothing is quite something
mainoo was unbelievable he made a huge contribution kudos to garnacho 
what a goal garnacho wow he is a true fan of cristiano
this goal is remarkable for more than 100 years pure talent garnacho
thats the greatest goal ive ever seen live from garnacho he runs about 5 steps away from the goal and still managed to get the power and the height he needed
what a historical moment for him this one just went up there with the one of rooney vs man city he even sealed it off with a cr7 celebration well done man
im a liverpool fan and even i have to admit this is probably one of the best goals ive ever seen you guys have a gem in garnacho please keep him
as a liverpool fan garnachos goal deserves to be the best goal in the premier league this season and is nominated for puskas 2024 what a goal 
garnachos goal was unstoppable 
you cant get over that garnacho goal
i love gernachos goal celebration right on point
aint no way garnacho  now that was siuuuuper insane

ff7r ps5",3100,"this game is gonna make me shed so many tears and i am so here for it cant wait for february already who else preordered
god that last shot of aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds
cids voice sounds great cant wait to see more of him in this game
the thing im looking forward to the most is the dyne plot line it seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around and barret was already so good in remake
this game is literally the only reason im going to buy a ps5 in the original midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game i cant wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror
aeriths new white dress is so pretty did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral
so excited for this game
props to loren alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game truly magnificent 
so niceeeeee cid and vincent in the party cloud and aerith barrets storythe gold saucer and marlene there with cloud and zack so insane looking forward to playing the second part
im emotional already who knew the impact and trauma ffvii would cause a whole generation
cid was one of my favorite characters in the original ff7 cant wait to play as him again in this remake
i love aerith so much i teared up beautiful song 
i love dynes voice well everyone looks amazing
oh my gosh cloud and aerith just two inches away from each other 
i still have phantom pain from 26 years ago that last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th time
this is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers  and i dont think its going to end the way we suspect  it wont be smiles and rainbows but i dont think aerith is going to die either  if she did then it would beg the question of what this was all for  we know this isnt a true remake but a sequel to the original game  the true remake is ever crisis
quite possibly the greatest game ever made
i nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer im not ready for this i just want to see these characters i grew up with have a happy ending but i know the journey of rebirth wont be an easy one final fantasy for life
nobuo uematsu is truly a legend he just knows how to make music fit the themes of final fantasy games so well cant have final fantasy without nobuo you just cant this song may possibly be the signature theme of ffvii games from now on the ending for ff vii is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this im looking forward to when that day comes

just realized paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady  shes basically a drone
i just hope furina gets the well deserved hug that she didnt receive
would be so cool if navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  
furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished love that for her
rip meluse and silver went out as heroes even beyond the grave rest well 
teleporting right to the key in domains is going to be a massive time saver i cant even count how many hundreds of times i did the sprint along the entrance stairs
i love it when sarah hosts the special programs
fontaine enabling a nonhydro related reaction with chevreuse is really an unexpected move
you know historically both france and japan have had influence each other in some point in time especially artistically so seeing inazuma chars in fontaine doesnt surprise me in the least lol

i am absolutely certain that if 1 of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did regardless of what that may be to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place
thank you james for encouraging people through coffee to do more do better and question what they do
the reason youre not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process no idea the details of how the machine works but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains
its fascinating that the spritzing makes a measurable difference to the extraction of the espresso i could totally see well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality itll probably never mean anything but its amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful quantitative change
i love the citizen science your channel is promoting and that youre encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared there is a signal here we just cant see it yet keep sharing keep signal boosting and keep experimenting
if you close your eyes you can experience what its like to have jon hamm describe coffee physics to you
i think when collecting data from lots of people tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important i keep my house really dry 30 for 3d printing and i see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder which doesnt have any bottleneck so rh may be a significant source of noise

its always a pleasure to watch these videos and even more of a pleasure to watch james slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago  somehow forgot that id since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat  while i cant endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real proustian moment while i played what the hell is that weird perfume flavor
my suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed which usually i would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry the oils in the coffee also probably dont help with that if you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference so a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates this is not contrary to what the prof said it might be a combination of both
even though im not that into coffee and usually just guess each time i make it i absolutely love your videos its not just the information but the candor the dedication without obsession and the curiosity i wish there were clones of you making youtube videos on different topics  itd be a better world
this is fascinating  theres a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee  ive been freezing beans for freshness since i use coffee pretty slowly  an unintended result is that when i take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold  its like getting a mist and mix for no effort  hard to control the amount which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room but interesting nonetheless  ive also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my breville barista express or my fellow ode gen 1 and not surprisingly ive had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders
man this video is surreal i dont think i ever had a chance to meet him specifically but i was just at a small conference with chris hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research i dont think ive ever seen someone ive encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this i suspected that he or his work about coffee though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry would show up here eventually though super exciting stuff
i am super excited that you got a particle size analyzer and from a legit analytical science company like anton paar that is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders burrs grind rpm etc which so far has been limited to assumptions wow that instrument is a significant investment too and im thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune so to speak can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere

im assuming well be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument cant wait 
i used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published my grinder is the new fellow opus it was the first time i did it with the opus because i never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech and i was so surprised that when wet it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when its dry now that this paper has been published im going to try it again
james i would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind my theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators i think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders  the eureka mignon oro has a metal spout and cup
i just tried spritzing for pour over coffee there was less static cling which was nice i also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower i only did it once so it could be a fluke
well done chris and his fellow authors as well as you james what shocks me is that there isnt more science on how to improve the taste of coffee probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively but there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques

tyler and bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots they endured sitingstanding in a wall and floor for 3 hours
jt fan favourite the insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though especially when james said how disgusting that would be like whats coming next year hiding in the septic tank
jt hiding in plain sight was awesome
funniest has to be jt and andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while james goofed around with his card trick but tyler and bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure hard to pick between the 2 though
wow lots of good hiding spots this year

its be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in
honestly tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening but tylers had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile
im surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid i was most impressed with jt hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently
someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year
if the hacksmith industries ever move to another building the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property
the insulation hiding spot was 200iq when james pulled out the thermal camera i thought he is not going to find that person with the camera
i love how much team work they put in and i love how often james walked past some people in plain sight lol
jt hiding was the best ive ever seen dude was just sitting there like nobodys business while james was running around legendary
i really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building this is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever
jts hiding spot deserves commendation james was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
this looks like so much fun despite the highpressure work environment and the demands of producing youtube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech yall still manage to bring your a game to hideandseek great job
jt hiding right in front james at the desk was by far the best even though he got caught eventually
i feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings
if i had a nickel for every time i saw a youtube based company playing hide and seek with their employees i would have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened right

tcofs dbd",2926,"for people who are confused

this is a brand new single player game set in the dbd universe featuring as far as we know original characters who will likely come to dbd as skins or characters in the future this is made in collaboration with supermassive games who are known to be behind until dawn the quarry and the dark pictures anthology this game will likely be in a style where the player makes choices that will alter the story it will release sometime in 2024

by the way the song is daylight by david kushner
this game has gone so far its insane
it actually looks so good more dead by daylight lore i cant wait
this could be supermassives best game since until dawn well done to both companies im excited  
i love how his helmet is shaped like entitys jaws solid way to reveal more about the character through his design
something about seeing from the world of dead by daylight with solemn music in the background is emotional like for the past 7 years excitement around dead by daylight had always been about what outside thing they brought in like license chapters for the first time hype is generated by someone else announcing that they are collaborating with dead by daylight im also so excited to be able to see dead by daylight in a more cinematic lense finally being able to properly experience the horror of dbd
theres a lot of symbolism in the name the casting of frank stone frank stoke being some form of character casting either being casted by the entity for what we know as the trials or casting in terms of being shaped or molded by the entity as well as casting and stone in the title could imply the saying casting the first stone so this may very well be some form of beginning to the story we know this may have been where the first stone of our story is casted
i like how the killer already looks so unsure about what he wants to do and what hes becoming and when hes shown off in the mask it looks like hes just exhausted and so regretful of whatever deal he made with the entity
you guys have no idea how happy i am to see you two collab together cant wait for this game
if they really want this to feel special i hope we also get to make choices from the killer pov remember that most killers are as much victims of the entity as the survivors and want to escape this purgatory
some hunches i have about this game

1 this could possibly be the first killer that arrived in the entities realm and tells the story about how he got there before being tossed into the void
2 the screams in the background are most likely the four main characters being held captive by said killer who at some point during the game manage to escape and you have to help them make it out alive 
3 the entitys full physical form is seen for the first time that being a gigantic spider while it is said that the realm itself is the entity ex trees birds pallets etc on the official dbd wiki it states that the entities most preferred form is that of a spider resembling something from stephen kings it 
4 its my strong hunch that whoever it is that is supposed to canonically survive the game will most likely show up as a future survivor in the core game 

all in all im really excited for this game cant wait to get my hands on it

edit when i was looking at the steam page for the game i also noticed a pharmaceutical store that had afterpiece tonic on it so well probably get to meet a younger version of the clown at some point or maybe a close relative that refers to him

edit 2 did some thinking and i believe that we will experience the 4 main characters get taken by the entity which will result in them encountering frank stone and we will experience a full trial in a more cinematic perspective this would explain why his workbench is covered in nature by the time the others show up so before that happens its really more so getting to know the towns history and the scars frank left behind
this is an infinitely more interesting collaboration than i thought it was going to be would be super fun to get some outfits or even chapters related to their other games
felt a surprising amount of emotion from this trailer very well made
you can see the reference from the song itself frank doesnt really want to kill but hes being forced by the entity

hiding all of our sins from the daylight  his eyes speaks from the sins he committed such a powerful trailer indeed
im crying seeing how far and how much dead by daylight has grown and i get a shot of nostalgia whenever i play this game
finally expanding the dbd franchise in a way that makes the most sense not everyone likes 4v1s but a lot of people like horror based story games 

imagine new characters or existing characters story fleshed out in an interactive way 

this is a good sign
this has to be one of my favorite trailers you guys have made the music the animation its just great
for anyone wondering what the gameplay and chase sequences will be like

most of the game is cutscenes where you make choices that determine events that happen and who livesdies all action sequences during the game are also cutscenes with things like quick time events for example if you had to jump over a pallet to escape the killer in the game a buttom would appear on the screen if you press the button before it vanishes you jump over the pallet if you dont then the character is either permenantly dead or lives through luck somehow the rest of the gameplay while not being chased will basically be 3rd person and you will just walk around through areas finding clues and trying to escape

also if you want more games like this check out until dawn the quarry and the 4 games in the dark picture anthology
this trailer is a masterpiece this music and this camera optics

httpvevolyuiv44k",2846,"sabrina you have no idea how fortunate i am to encounter this on youtube the moment i opened it 
she can sing act danceshe really can do everything
shes feeding us with this holiday bop
shes a triple threat she can sing act and dance the production amazing and such a holiday bop 
im so serious this needs to become a christmas classic a beautiful sad christmas song about wanting someone to notice you in time for the holidays that happens to be so true for so many people
sabrina youre literally saving the music industry youre literally a princess i just dont know how to say it but thank you from the bottom of my heart
he wont bring you somebody who loves you more than me wrote the lyrics brilliantly and her voice 
she really deserve global artist of the year 2024 lets keep on loving her by her entire being and her charismatic voice too guys lets do love her
she needs to win a grammy asap 
im sure this will be a christmas classic song forever thank you so much sabrina
i could go on and on with my praises for the lyricism but as far as the music video is concerned its so simple in the best way and i love it its cute romantic and lighthearted with definitely some undertones of nostalgiaregret the video paired with the actual lyrics make you yearn for that special person like youre missing someone either firsthand or secondhand if youve never been in a relationshiponesided crushsituationship i love this thanks sabrina merry christmas 
i love that shes releasing christmas music so versatile its amazing and has so many og songs
a qumica que eles exalam a voz dela a atuao a vibe o carisma deles perfeito
is it just me or does she give that 90s vibe we all need  love everything about her
the fact that all her videos are like movies  the creativity is unmatched  her  her voice  perfect 
in my humble opinion sabrina is the hardest working and most underappreciated female artist out there today  awesome talent as everyone else on here has pointed out  and apparently has been more successful than some of the disney alumni at keeping her head on straight  im always anxious to see what she chooses to do next
this song is pure magic sabrinas vocals are on point and the music video is a visual treat its definitely going to be on my holiday playlist 
i swear this song is going to be a new christmas classic

its her and her mom having matching hairstyles for me
how did they skip over the pinkprint era so elegant and a turn for her
nicki is so iconic a popstar a rapper nicki has literally done it all in the last 15 years
she has had way more iconic looks than just these few that vogue picked out
remember thinking she always stayed in character for the cameras when she first came outshes really layered personality wise fascinating
idk why nickis recent videos make me so emotional shes truly come full circle in my lifetime and the first artist ive ever grown alongside
lets talk about how professional and gorgeous and still incorporating her personality into her vibe and mannerisms at the same time
these are all iconic but these werent what i was expecting all of her super iconic looks we know her for she was heavily judged for at the time but it was so impactful and inspiring for little me to see a woman like her in fashion where is harajuku barbie
she has so many looks i could watch her talk about them all day do this a 100 times more with her",24,Entertainment,13800000,PT9M25S,"['what icon people were really trying erase this woman impactful history and rewrite her legacy but failed miserably she highly blessed', 'why did skip 20132017 she had iconic look during those year', 'you all need bring her back and through her 20102017 look those are truly some the most iconic moment fashion period', 'this woman iconic one can brake her she the girl', 'okay but why are not_ talking about her look between 2014 2017 they are the most iconic feel like not_ ignore them', 'this could have easily been minute she many iconic look', 'she such natural beauty too like look 803 are you serious', 'feeling very elongated', 'nice see nicki overcame the hate sad watching her 20182020 interview and hearing the hurt her voice but here she sound calm healed and better than ever', 'nicki articulate wonder she great wordsmith her writing she calm more relaxed aura this era loving', 'love the way she speaking this intelligent touch with fashion and herself gagging over here not_ stan any artist besides nicki minaj she created this whole entire world brand and music that different than anything else she really leaf speechless', 'her and her mom having matching hairstyle for', 'how did they skip over the pinkprint era elegant and turn for her', 'nicki iconic popstar rapper nicki literally done all the last year', 'she had way more iconic look than just these few that vogue picked out', 'remember thinking she always stayed character for the camera when she first came outshes really layered personality wise fascinating', 'not_ know why nickis recent video make emotional she truly come full circle lifetime and the first artist have ever grown alongside', 'let talk about how professional and gorgeous and still incorporating her personality into her vibe and mannerism the same time', 'these are all iconic but these were not_ what expecting all her super iconic look know her for she heavily judged for the time but impactful and inspiring for little see woman like her fashion where harajuku barbie', 'she many look could watch her talk about them all day this 100 time more with her']",565

im glad ryan and tatum got to take that photo together after so many years everything came full circle after the drama in their lives rip ryan
condolences to ryans family especially tatum and redmond

 he was a very good actor and will be missed
done well to reach 82yrs rip we all have our struggles to deal with no one is perfect  papermoon is timeless classic
i always wished i could chat with tatum about her dad its tough to have a parent thats an alcoholic and is emotionally distant from you especially when he divorces your mother and you feel like youve been replaced despite all of that i hope in the end they were able to mend their relationshipnot just for his sake but for hers as well carrie fischer once quoted her famous mother saying resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die my wish for them both is that they forgave each other for whatever and were able to say i love you before it was too late
my sincerest condolences to ryans family and friends  i loved him in love story so sad to see our childhood icons move on to another plain rest in peace 
death comes at any time for anyone we have to be prepared for our final hour we are immortal only the body dies the soul lives forever i hope he finds peace
i feel so sad for his children  my condolences for all the grieving they have gone through 
i still remember sitting in the movie theater and sobbing    along with a lot of other teenage girls in the audience  love story   something about the music film locations and cast that  were timeless

condolences to ryans family especially tatum and redmond he was a very good actor and will be missed
i would like to give my condolences to the family of ryan oneal he was an outstanding actori did not see every movie that he made but i seen a number of themrip mr oneal
i actually feel sorry for tatum more than anything
i worked on a movie with him as a crew member he was nothing but professional wanting to do his best performancelike he wanted the glory of love story i felt sorry for him on many levels noticing how hard he was on himself after a take second guessing himself and genuinely trying to give his best performance rest in piece mr o niel
death is always sadsometimes a welcomed release but sad my love goes out to his family rest in peace ryan
my heart goes out to tatum its hard when a parent dies and leaves things unresolved with you much like tatum provably felt you wait a lifetime for that person to change because no matter what else they are they are still your latent sadly i know this too well
aside from him as a father and person i think he was a fabulous actor and he made wonderful movies my heart goes out to poor tatum i hope she found some kind of closure with her father
i always admired him as an actor its a shame he wasnt a very good father his children really suffered because of it i hope they can put it behind them and heal now
he was one of the greatest actors of our time rest in power 
mr onesl   and  thank you
ryan was an honorable actor his private life didnt fit the same category we are not perfect parents i am so happy the family was able to reunite and reconcile their past for the most part my thoughts and prayers go out to his sons and especially tatum i always worry about her i pray to god she is able to get some peace finally she definitely deserves it i also experienced a bad abusive childhood but when my dad closed his eyes he took all of that with him so i really hope that she can gain just a fraction of some hope here one thing for sure ryan fiercely fought the last 23 years of his life i gotta hand it to him hes really strong im praying and thinking of you tatum all of your fans are we hope youre recuperating well from your stroke too

US,C3iHAgwIYtI,starship  second flight test,spacex,2023-12-07T18:10:15Z,,1014547,50668,"on november 18 2023 starship successfully lifted off at 702 am ct from starbase on its second integrated flight test 

while it didnt happen in a lab or on a test stand it was absolutely a test what we did with this second flight will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing starship 

the test achieved a number of major milestones helping us improve starships reliability as spacex seeks to make life multiplanetary the team at starbase is already working final preparations on the vehicles slated for use in starships third flight test 

congratulations to the entire spacex team on an exciting second flight test of starship

follow us on xcomspacex for continued updates on starships progress",2431,"we need these streams back on youtube i need to see this on a large display
so great seeing all 33 raptor engines staying lit during the entire stage 1 ascent excellent work
i really hope you start showing the spacex launches on youtube again their are many many people who dont do social media and miss watching all the falcon launches and updates
great work to all at spacex as always
excited to see spacex making history in our lifetimes
im 67 and i remember the space program from mercury through apollo they used to wheel a tv into the classrooms so we could watchyou cant imagine how thrilled i am to see this happening spacex is just running away with the ball so happy for everyone on the project 
i love this
please bring back live launches to youtube or make a smart tv app for x so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone
this is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and cooperation long live the entire team at spacex 
the length of the flame plume is completely insane starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
it looks almost like an animation the performance of those 33 raptor engines was flawless 
it was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life thank you spacex team
106 the shutdown of the engines in a ring from the outside to the inside pure exhibitionism from spacex a true spectacle
inspiring mom always told me shoot for the stars because youll land on the moon i always think about it when i look up thank you guys for always pushing yourselves it reminds me to do the same
its amazing how close the shot at 053 looks to prior renders of starship both by spacex and by fans
the way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome well done spacex
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the spacex team 3
go for it
this gave me goosebumps i feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future thankyou spacex 
impressive epic view of liftoff the visuals from spacex have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech   looks like spacex is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles
compared to the first test flight this one was like night and day bravo spacex crew ift 3

kierans new character design mixed with the music was really well done
im excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around paldea hope theyre not shiny locked and you can finally get shiny sword  shield legendaries
152 i love how when the player character sends out ionos magnemite she sends the pokeball the way iono does thats a nice detail
everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary pokemon but im just glad we get to see more larry
honestly it feels like teal mask walked so that indigo disk could run looking forward to this one
350 not only am i glad darkrai is getting the attention he deserves but also challenging dialga and palkia with darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie
yes blastoise 3d model is finally fixed ive been wanting this for over 10 years his face is sculpted proper his cannons are the correct size and his shell white trim is now sculpted properly hoohs new model also looks nice
the fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries  not only does its lore look interesting but we are finally getting the majestic minogame pokemon that ive been wanting since squirtlewartortle didnt evolve into one
gen 9 isnt even over yet and im already nostalgic for it and ive been a pokemon fan since the beginning
im so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there the music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement
i love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders can we have the team star members back as well love those guys
this dlc has been amazing so far its been personally heartwarming to see familiar pokmon return and have new places to explore
im so freaking happy all the starters are coming back cant wait to find a popplio
i dont often comment on youtube videosbut im extremely excited for this one get to bring back some of my favourite pokmon i collected over the years to join me in this dlc im also excited for new pokmon to catch and explore this new area been playing since 2006 when i was 14 amazing that how pokmon games have come along the way
i hope that the catch rate for legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown paradox entei and paradox terrakion
theres so much about this trailer that im really happy about i am hyped cant wait for this to come out
one thing i seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing 

and oh man keiran looks like hes changed quite a lot i guess well have to see if theres a way to save him but it looks like hes gone villain mode or maybs just angsty rival mode

still its gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again and how the story is going to play out i mean getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too never even expected them to pull off a dialga and palkia tera raid much less give out a darkrai even though you can get one in legends arceus or bdsp if you managed to the members card last year

still all these new things are amazing 
i cant wait for the indigo disk everything ive seen  looks amazing especially the fact we can get old starters from previous games and the extra interactions with the gym leaders and old legendaries too ",20,Gaming,5550000,PT4M14S,"['man excited for the next pokemon adventure', 'kierans new character design mixed with the music really well done', 'excited see the legendary pokemon static encounter all around paldea hope they are not_ shiny locked and you can finally get shiny sword shield legendaries', '152 love how when the player character sends out ionos magnemite she sends the pokeball the way iono doe that nice detail', 'everyone excited see the return more starter and legendary pokemon but just glad get see more larry', 'honestly feel like teal mask walked that indigo disk could run looking forward this one', '350 not_ only glad darkrai getting the attention deserves but also challenging dialga and palkia with darkrai nice reference the 10th movie', 'yes blastoise model finally fixed have been wanting this for over year his face sculpted proper his cannon are the correct size and his she will white trim now sculpted properly hoohs new model also look nice', 'the fact that they focused the tao trio specifically make extremely hopeful for legend kyurem game soon', 'terapagos potential one favorite legendaries not_ only doe lore look interesting but are finally getting the majestic minogame pokemon that have been wanting since squirtlewartortle did not_ evolve into one', 'gen not_ even over yet and already nostalgic for and have been pokemon fan since the beginning', 'excited deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallway look really cool wonder there will hint civilization down there the music that accompanies the trailer fit well and add level excitement', 'love the return the teacher and the gym leader can have the team star member back well love those guy', 'this dlc been amazing far been personally heartwarming see familiar pokmon return and have new place explore', 'freaking happy all the starter are coming back cannot wait find popplio', 'not_ often comment youtube videosbut extremely excited for this one get bring back some favourite pokmon collected over the year join this dlc also excited for new pokmon catch and explore this new area been playing since 2006 when amazing that how pokmon game have come along the way', 'hope that the catch rate for legendaries been drastically increased surprised that they have not_ shown paradox entei and paradox terrakion', 'there much about this trailer that really happy about hyped cannot wait for this come out', 'one thing seriously hope about the legendaries that they can hunted because that would amazing', '', 'and man keiran look like changed quite lot guess well have see there way save him but look like gone villain mode maybs just angsty rival mode', '', 'still going exciting get see all the gym leader again and how the story going play out mean getting all these new mystery gift been pleasent surprise too never even expected them pull off dialga and palkia tera raid much give out darkrai even though you can get one legend arceus bdsp you managed the member card last year', '', 'still all these new thing are amazing', 'cannot wait for the indigo disk everything have seen look amazing especially the fact can get old starter from previous game and the extra interaction with the gym leader and old legendaries too']",254

the fact that this is a whole new experience and is free you really gotta give props to epic and lego for this its actually insane
i honestly thought this was going to be just a fun little gimmick for fortnite for a little while but no they clearly put a ton of love and effort into this and the song choice was perfect for the trailer  made me nostalgic for the days i used to play with legos as a kid
not a huge fortnite fan but the devs really put a lot of love and care into their updates wish other developers were the same
might be the best crossover so far
i love that this feels like a callback to the original design of fortnite being a horror survival by night and material base builder by day
i really hope that this is a permanent mode that gets more updates and love from the devs this looks amazing
this is legit what lego worlds should have been
this is pretty epic ngl the effort and care they put into this is really outstanding
this is what we needed we needed a free roam no story lego game im super hyped to play when i get on
i think everyone is truly underestimating the quality of this new game version all the custom skins and animations they had to remake and all the sounds and ideas truly we should thank the developers and not the ones telling them to make it thank you developers
i dont think people understand how much effort this took honestly looks amazing
as a massive lego and lego game fan as well as a fortnite enjoyer i gotta say you guys knocked it outta the park and i love you for it i have been asking for a lego survival for ages little did i know that lego would not deliver but epic would thank you for this
i love how in the end they put adventure is building is a great recall to the battle is building that appears during the first trailer of battle royale
how is there zero paid content for this mode its so insanely good and i was not expecting a completely new game this was awesome
the fact that this is such a new experience and its free that you actually have to give epic and lego props for this is actually crazy
the music alone had me beyond hyped 117

all the brawlers sound fun as hell though im surprised the 3rd brawler is for the rt trio and not the castle court yard
which brawler are you most excited for
subscribe for update sneak peeks
for larry and lawry i wish we could switch playing between them as long as both are alive also it wouldve been cool if we could choose with which one we start the match this will also be the one that respawns during the match
kairos turns a 10 minutes brawl talk into a 20 minutes analysis and i wouldnt want it any other way 30 minutes of my saturday well spent
watching kairos after brawl talk is compulsory 
333 its not that the healing is inconsistent kit heals a flat percentage of the brawlers max hp every second  the inconsistency is megs natural health regeneration
i feel like one of the l duos gadgets will let us change to the other l meaning we will be able to play as larry  the evilbad one
i think a better idea for larry and laury is that their super would make them switch out so you can have a different attack power
wasnt sandy once classified as support

update its true on the wiki it shows us that on 01232020 sandy was changed from a fighter to support he was later reclassified again to controller so kitt isnt the first legendary support just the only current one
just a quick fix there is a frame in the brawl talk where you can see mortiss gear speeds up bats by 50 great video kairos
it would be cool if for larry and lawrie you are able to change perspectives using maybe a gadget of some sorts
i like having some sort of stage hazards like the ice we havent had that since the minecarts and it adds some good variety
if they add hot zone 5v5 i hope they add a contested mechanic because having 10 people constantly coming to the zone will be more of a who reaches the zone first wins than capture and defend the zone

also the cartoon trio skins is a wierd trio
anime cat maid colette
cuphead rico
and power puff girls spike with mickey mouse pants
i think it would be fun if we had the choice to switch between laury and lawry just like how eve can switch her attack pattern by equiping star power so it would be cool if we had the sp
you can see how when edgar activates his hypercharge he doesnt get the reload buff only when he jumps with his super he starts having the red effect sign of a reload speed buff like bulls 1st star power and megs 2nd gadget
it would be fun if it would be chosen randomly if you play larry or lawrie after respawn or joining a match

lyrics 
welcome to my problems
its not an invitation
this is my dilemma
and its my obsession

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

welcome to my nightmare
where dreams go to disappear
sit around in rehab
feeling like a lab rat

strange days are here again
and its getting weirder
heres to all my problems
i just want to drink the poison

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

oh why
when i fall asleep tonight
on the wing
and prayer
oh why
for despair and obsession on you
you yeah

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

new album saviors out january 19th 2024 preorder it now httpsgreendaylnktosaviors
this album feels like you just found an old green day song you never listened to and youre listening to it for the first time
im proud of you man you were a father figure to me and did a lot for me when i was a kid even if you didnt know it your music saved my life im glad youre still breathing and were able to overcome the difficulties that you faced  much love billie
most authentic green day in a long while this is a fantastic return
this is by far my favorite single from this album so far feels like a return to form and im all here for it siked for the drop
welcome to my nightmare where dreams go to disappear 

green day still hits hard
how do i explain this this song feels like that one green day song ive been wanting so badly the preamerican idiot song that sounds like their old stuff but new american idiot is amazing and loved everything after that but ive been missing the old sound and this is mixed with new sound too they nailed it

i also hear a little longshot in this too
the best song theyve released in at least 10 years
absolutely phenomenal love the sound of every aspect of this song instrumental and vocal so on point excited for the rest of this album 
this is probably one of my favorite music videos from them its so simple but gets the message across
thank you green day you guys and your music are so dear to my heart i am having some struggles with substance abuse more specifically alcohol youve inspired me billie to create a new years resolution of quitting drinking before it wrecks me it wont be easy to keep it up next month ill be 27 i have bipolar disorder and this is no way to heal i appreciate you all so much
green day and drop d tuning something i never thought id see but theyve done it and i fucking love it
this band is amazing 
no joke this has to be the best song theyve released since anything on american idiot

mature themes gritty and powerful great lyrics great melody and a very catchy chorus

gosh i love green day so much absolute banger 
the more you listen to this song the more you get into it
this truly hits me fuck man i lost the one i thought was going to be by my side forever
man the new album is gonna be amazing 3
my mom recently passed away and on the same month they released their first songs from their new album they have helped me a lot but this song hits different being in a dark place and having some weird thoughts and green day shining a bright light on me through this song is what i needed  thank you for a second chance

outro cover done by httpswwwyoutubecomchanneluccs0ucupsilvk8qin5byia",3003,"you know i expected it to be bad i did not expect it to take a 180 and be an awful extraction shooter thats the biggest plot twist of all time was expecting a survival game but we were given a whole dumpster surprise
we are not surprised the developers are laughing all the way to the bank for every single person that spent 40 for this
the fact this game was the most wishlisted game on steam is insane
i was pretty much expecting it to be this bad what kind of bothers me is how they marketed the game in one trailer they scripted it as to make it seem like the two players are speaking to each other using voip their usernames highlight when speaking and everything features like that get shown in trailers and then end up being non existent in the game its no wonder they deleted the old trailers from their channel ign kept them uploaded though
the fact that people had such low expectations for this and it still managed to do even worse is incredible
well done everyone for feeding this type of scams
the day before is a perfect example to never ever under any circumstances trust a trailer or pre order anything before a full release
they didnt disappoint its exactly what i expected
i wasnt waiting for this game i was waiting for this video
hey pick up some merch maybe httpsbigfryshopcom  thanks for the amazing day
just so be clear the entire city map which is not even open world is a unreal engine store asser you can get for 539
hopefully other devs see what these devs promised showed in trailers and can make the original idea into a reality
the alarms use so many resources that zombies cannot spawn in maybe if they reduce the amount of alarms from 1000 to 10 they could add 5 more zombies wow what a sad game
517 im legit crying tears of laughter great work on this man i know you were on this literally since the day before day one and love to see it come full circle i dont know if the day befores saga is finally over but always enjoy your takes on it
i had a great time watching your stream today thanks for taking one for the team so i didnt have to waste my money on absolute garbage
watched your live stream while caring for my daughter thanks for the laughs the absolute shame of this and other games they rely on our hope for something amazing and sucker people in this game deff solid bet on train wreck hence the sales it got no one wanted to miss out like watching a fight at school
something that promised so much and ended up being completely different can definitely be fit into a class action lawsuit especially this
the moment when the character running for hours and looking into sky and said  so this is what a day before feels like this is the day before that i always looking for  put tears in my eye
ill never forget how blown away i was the first time i saw the trailer i just cant believe things turned out this way
we all knew this was going to happen whats upsetting is that i wanted it to be good so that i could have a fun coop shooter with the squad because we dont really have many games like that we arent sick of my next hope of things that could be cool but probably will be really bad is ubisofts skull and bones it cant be that hard to make good games that people can play with their friends",20,Gaming,328000,PT10M28S,"['you know expected bad did not_ expect take 180 and awful extraction shooter that the biggest plot twist all time expecting survival game but were given whole dumpster surprise', 'are not_ surprised the developer are laughing all the way the bank for every single person that spent for this', 'the fact this game the most wishlisted game steam insane', 'pretty much expecting this bad what kind bother how they marketed the game one trailer they scripted make seem like the two player are speaking each other using voip their usernames highlight when speaking and everything feature like that get shown trailer and then end being non existent the game wonder they deleted the old trailer from their channel ign kept them uploaded though', 'the fact that people had such low expectation for this and still managed even worse incredible', 'well done everyone for feeding this type scam', 'the day before perfect example never ever under any circumstance trust trailer pre order anything before full release', 'they did not_ disappoint exactly what expected', 'not_ waiting for this game waiting for this video', 'hey pick some merch maybe thanks for the amazing day', 'just clear the entire city map which not_ even open world unreal engine store asser you can get for 539', 'hopefully other devs see what these devs promised showed trailer and can make the original idea into reality', 'the alarm use many resource that zombie cannot spawn maybe they reduce the amount alarm from 1000 they could add more zombie wow what sad game', '517 legit cry tear laughter great work this man know you were this literally since the day before day one and love see come full circle not_ know the day befores saga finally over but always enjoy your take', 'had great time watching your stream today thanks for taking one for the team did not_ have waste money absolute garbage', 'watched your live stream while caring for daughter thanks for the laugh the absolute shame this and other game they rely our hope for something amazing and sucker people this game deff solid bet train wreck hence the sale got one wanted miss out like watching fight school', 'something that promised much and ended being completely different can definitely fit into class action lawsuit especially this', 'the moment when the character running for hour and looking into sky and said this what day before feel like this the day before that always looking for put tear eye', 'ill never forget how blown away the first time saw the trailer just cannot believe thing turned out this way', 'all knew this going happen what upsetting that wanted good that could have fun coop shooter with the squad because not_ really have many game like that are not_ sick next hope thing that could cool but probably will really bad ubisofts skull and bone cannot that hard make good game that people can play with their friend']",628

i never expected lego and fortnite to come together but this cinematic trailer was a masterpiece
actions speak louder than words no dialogues pure lego greatness
this looks sooo dope i cant wait to play
at first i was disappointed that everything wasnt out of legos but now i actually think real environments mixed with lego might actually work better imo
this honestly looks like if save the world didnt go for a zombie approach and just went full survival and im all for it
now imagine being a kid and seeing this
prime childhood moment right there
if this was a real show id watch every episode of it the animation team is absolutely killing it
i cant believe how good this looks 
i wasnt sure how to feel about this when it was first announced but damn im hyped now it actually looks like possibly one of the best lego games ever
whether u love fortnite or hate it u cant deny the creativity and talent this team puts together to make incredible content
wow crazy lego game 
this looks and sounds really fun

guilty gear  the next entry to the series

guilty gear official x
httpstwittercomguiltygearpr

the fate of the universe will be determined
the story of guilty gear spanning over 20 years will finally come to a conclusion in guilty gear strive the trials and tribulations of the series heroes and villains will finally be resolved discover the astonishing truth awaiting at the end of all things

check out the play style of the second character in season pass 3 elphelt in this trailer

 arc system works",1055,"a new elphelt full of rock death metal and love now thats quite the sentence
her being death metal vocalist makes so much sense considering her lore love it
im really glad they got cassandra lee morris to come back i liked her voice in sign
elphelt went from innocence to gotta kill em all god i love guilty gear
my immense hate for elphelt immediately dissipates upon hearing that theme song shes the best character now
i adore the new dimensions theyve added to her design and personality with this
they made her a metalhead and i love it cant wait to main her
they changed her whole style and not gonna lie i loved it she looks hella awesome and she drops today great stuff
the transition from monologue into growling was freakin iconic i jumped out of my chair when i heard this live
a character reveal so good we all put aside our zoner hate for one video
i wanna see elphelt compete against inos and decide who can pull off the best musical performance
from a desperate romantic to a hardcore rockstar and i love it
i think everyone in the elphelt nation miss the rabbit ears she had  i wish that was incorporated somewhere in her design
i honestly really love this direction its genuinely a whole new elphelt same character but her identity is oh so different i guess that makes sense though cause like ram her story was also about identity but anyway its just really cool and im glad theyre expanding her character shes already a lot more interesting than she was originally to me not to say i didnt like her before  ahhhhh 

also no shade to naoki but its really cool that theyre introducing new singers onto the tracks his vocals were sometimes hard to decipher especially in the circle i still to this day have not seen a fully accurate interpretation of the lyrics to that song even spotify has the wrong lyrics 

but i mean its also just cool because of more variety
glad to see elphelt come back she may not be aba but shes still pretty great love the direction they went with her who knew sleeper agents could be such great metalheads
so if i remember elphets backstory she was engaged to a rock musician at one point right didnt she get her power and the memories warning her about ram pretty much at the altar its why her original costume looked like a wedding dress it literally was her wedding dress that she never got the chance to use what exactly happened to her fianc again because a lot of her dialogue in previous games and that one line in this trailer seems to indicate she is still looking for a serious romantic relationship did her fianc just never exist and those were fake memories she was given by the universal will as part of a cover story did she come to the conclusion she didnt love her spouse to be anymore if they were real or did her fianc get killed off screen during the events of xrd or i suppose the writers could have just forgotten about that character they were literally so inconsequential they never came up or were given a name so i suppose thatd be fine just seems a little odd
making elphelt a metal vocalist while also staying true to her loveydovey pastel self was one of the best directions they could have taken her character in never doubt daisukes vision
looks like elphelts taking some inspiration from sol with her new weapon the fact it acts as a microphone stand makes the freddy mercury reference more significant
i wont lie when the render was leaked i was really disappointed but now seeing her ingame makes me happy and she looks really cool 
very excited for her elphelt has been my most anticipated character for strive",20,Gaming,234000,PT1M31S,"['new elphelt full rock death metal and love now that quite the sentence', 'her being death metal vocalist make much sense considering her lore love', 'really glad they got cassandra lee morris come back liked her voice sign', 'elphelt went from innocence got kill them all god love guilty gear', 'immense hate for elphelt immediately dissipates upon hearing that theme song she the best character now', 'adore the new dimension they have added her design and personality with this', 'they made her metalhead and love cannot wait main her', 'they changed her whole style and not_ going lie loved she look hella awesome and she drop today great stuff', 'the transition from monologue into growling freakin iconic jumped out chair when heard this live', 'character reveal good all put aside our zoner hate for one video', 'want see elphelt compete against inos and decide who can pull off the best musical performance', 'from desperate romantic hardcore rockstar and love', 'think everyone the elphelt nation miss the rabbit ear she had wish that incorporated somewhere her design', 'honestly really love this direction genuinely whole new elphelt same character but her identity different guess that make sense though because like ram her story also about identity but anyway just really cool and glad they are expanding her character she already lot more interesting than she originally not_ say did not_ like her before ahhhhh', '', 'also shade naoki but really cool that they are introducing new singer onto the track his vocal were sometimes hard decipher especially the circle still this day have not_ seen fully accurate interpretation the lyric that song even spotify the wrong lyric', '', 'but mean also just cool because more variety', 'glad see elphelt come back she may not_ aba but she still pretty great love the direction they went with her who knew sleeper agent could such great metalhead', 'remember elphets backstory she engaged rock musician one point right did not_ she get her power and the memory warning her about ram pretty much the altar why her original costume looked like wedding dress literally her wedding dress that she never got the chance use what exactly happened her fianc again because lot her dialogue previous game and that one line this trailer seems indicate she still looking for serious romantic relationship did her fianc just never exist and those were fake memory she given the universal will part cover story did she come the conclusion she did not_ love her spouse anymore they were real did her fianc get killed off screen during the event xrd suppose the writer could have just forgotten about that character they were literally inconsequential they never came were given name suppose that would fine just seems little odd', 'making elphelt metal vocalist while also staying true her loveydovey pastel self one the best direction they could have taken her character never doubt daisukes vision', 'look like elphelts taking some inspiration from sol with her new weapon the fact act microphone stand make the freddy mercury reference more significant', 'will not_ lie when the render leaked really disappointed but now seeing her ingame make happy and she look really cool', 'very excited for her elphelt been most anticipated character for strive']",91

my channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns with these videos i want to show off cool speedruns explain how they work and entertain hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself because it is truly a lot of fun

eazyspeezy cuphead speedrun",776,"this is a certified i tried 100 speedrunning cuphead moment
to think that the devs had to sell their own house at one point to finish the game
the game flopping would have been terrifying
this man has professionalism in 70 of the entirety of video games
3710 its surprising how few people know that the parry hitboxes for king dices cards are extended upward if you are playing as chalice however the fight against hopus pocus the rabbit is almost impossible to complete without taking damage so cuphead is still optimal for this level
the fact that he called cagney flowey without acknowledging it is too funny
here she turns into a sausage and tries to attack us with her swirling meat attacks  while we also have to deal with a bunch of dangling meats
how did you get past the first level so fast i saw a professional video game journalist spend 25 minutes on it because of its difficulty
while i have 300 the game im definitely not mad enough to try speed running it yet respect
there are several reasons im terrible at cuphead but one of them is that i get distracted wanting to watch the brilliant animations
if you play the circus run and gun level you van dodge roll through the stack of minions if u stand on the top platform just roll jump and dash to the next platform that you you dont have to shoot them and safe time 
it also works on the cannons at the end at that section
this game is just amazing for many reasons and i would love to see it more on this channel
the divine relic is actually perfect for the devil on his second phase you can spam your whetstone to deal a ton of damage and kill him insanely quickly
cuphead is so unique in like every aspect i love it
even though i have s ranked every boss in the game i will definitely not speedrun the game like you mad respect there were even things i didnt know you showed in your speedrun like mortimer freezes final phase has no hitbox damn
i never knew that not attacking the onion was a viable option
for those who dont know if u leave the dogs alive but damage their jetpacks when the jetpacks spray gray smoke instead of white smoke then the fight becomes slightly easier because the robot dog wont flip the screen upside down
im so sad that speed runs take so long to do because i could watch your videos every day all the time  theyre so good
this is the most beautiful game ever made and i dont see it getting beaten any time soon ill take a unique and amazingly creative artstyle like this over photorealistic graphics any day
this is easily top 3 favourite games of all time such a unique game and every level is a boss apart from run n guns absolutely love it

sal a mirar la luna pero termin mirando tus fotos

go on an emotional journey and walk the delicate line between life and death in this special persona 3 reload trailer for thegameawards

persona 3 reload releases february 2 2024 preorder your copy today httpsatluslink3ql1zz5",846,"the new music sounds so good it seems to be the new opening called full moon full life the animation quality is beautiful the gameplay and the visuals of the world look so amazing and the voices of the characters and the social links sound great as well
this game looks so incredible this will definitely be the best way to experience persona 3
the meaning of life
so bold atlus so bold never thought youd be this direct when marketing this game
every trailer just gets me more hyped for this game
i think i was able to start living because of the time i spent with my friends
 makoto yuki persona 3 winter of rebirth

edit to me hell always be minato arisato 
really looking forward to doing akinaris social link again his social link was the most meaningful and important social link in the entire game
cmon bro i almost teared up at junpeis voice line zeno really about to make me cry
every new teaser keeps getting me more and more excited for this game to drop the animation is just incredible and beautiful i cant wait 
aleks le absolutely killed it with that gutwrenching scream at 106 it really does sound like how getting your psyche physically ripped apart would probably feel  rly excited to see his performance as a couple other characters too hes such a talented va
is this the opening theme man the reload originals just dont miss that second half feels straight up like a battle theme
bebe sounds way more badass than i expected him to loving all the social link voices so great to finally hear them even kenji seems more likable just from his voice acting
my life has meaning once again when you remake the game thank you team atlus
that amazing song with all those shots of the crew and akinari talking about the meaning of life actually made me tear up well played atlus
already more than excited to play reload and if the song used in this trailer is in its opening thatll be amazing also love the fact lucien dodge is akinari dudes a fantastic voice actor so it great he gets to voice my favorite social link from the original p3
the opening song is a banger man
all the social links feel even more alive junpei and akinaris lines are beautifully done and the armageddon fusion spell at the end man this 2024 is looking like a great year for gaming
i just realized that every character being voiced means the sun confidant is included
122 made me instantly tear up
im so glad every persona soundtrack comes with a game inside
that one line from zeno as junpei has fully cemented that he has what it takes 

junpei has this strange gentleness in his voice that i was afraid was going to get lost in the wackiness but no he definitely hit a home run
106 and 117 really gave me goosebumps phenomenal voice acting from aleks lee and zeno robinson
man persona 3 is my favourite so glad they are making this i hope with the new graphics people will come to love this game as much as i do",20,Gaming,216000,PT2M1S,"['the new music sound good seems the new opening called full moon full life the animation quality beautiful the gameplay and the visuals the world look amazing and the voice the character and the social link sound great well', 'this game look incredible this will definitely the best way experience persona', 'the meaning life', 'bold atlus bold never thought you would this direct when marketing this game', 'every trailer just get more hyped for this game', 'think able start living because the time spent with friend', 'makoto yuki persona winter rebirth', '', 'edit hell always minato arisato', 'really looking forward doing akinaris social link again his social link the most meaningful and important social link the entire game', 'cmon bro almost teared junpeis voice line zeno really about make cry', 'every new teaser keep getting more and more excited for this game drop the animation just incredible and beautiful cannot wait', 'aleks absolutely killed with that gutwrenching scream 106 really doe sound like how getting your psyche physically ripped apart would probably feel really excited see his performance couple other character too such talented', 'this the opening theme man the reload original just not_ miss that second half feel straight like battle theme', 'bebe sound way more badass than expected him loving all the social link voice great finally hear them even kenji seems more likable just from his voice acting', 'life meaning once again when you remake the game thank you team atlus', 'that amazing song with all those shot the crew and akinari talking about the meaning life actually made tear well played atlus', 'already more than excited play reload and the song used this trailer opening that will amazing also love the fact lucien dodge akinari dude fantastic voice actor great get voice favorite social link from the original', 'the opening song banger man', 'all the social link feel even more alive junpei and akinaris line are beautifully done and the armageddon fusion spell the end man this 2024 looking like great year for gaming', 'just realized that every character being voiced mean the sun confidant included', '122 made instantly tear', 'glad every persona soundtrack come with game inside', 'that one line from zeno junpei fully cemented that what take', '', 'junpei this strange gentleness his voice that afraid going get lost the wackiness but definitely hit home run', '106 and 117 really gave goosebump phenomenal voice acting from aleks lee and zeno robinson', 'man persona favourite glad they are making this hope with the new graphic people will come love this game much']",121

lyrics

baby estoy activa
ando con mi amiga y
ella est loca por probarte
y yo quiero repetir
no te asustes

esos gritos marcan mis memorias
tienes de highlight en ig los lugares que te lo meti
pa darte de nuevo y repetir ya me compre un delorean
chingamos y lo hacemos parte de la historia
contigo encima mirandome esa carita angelical ya me siento llegando a la gloria
te ves mas hackea desde que te hiciste el body kit
dime si en esas nalgas firmo el split
que yo quiero el porciento one hundred de ti
me tiene enchulao tu cara eh bellakiita
y ese olor a fresita
en el cielo te agarro  te aprieto  te beso te muerdo te escupo la boca y me gritas

coro 

uuu uuu
esta bellakera y el culo que ella tiene
ya tamo ready pal versus
siempre se le pega mi olor
cada vez que se monta en la lexus
eso la chotea abajo le gotea
si el jevo frontea lo mando con jess
lo dejo a cinco grados celsius

uuu uuu
cuando estoy trancao en el estu
los polvo que echamo son de triple doble a lo westbrook
la nota nos tiene flotando
veinte mil pies de altitud
voltea los ojos como el undertaker
cuando entierro el muerto sin atad

yo le dije que t quieres pdelo que te complazco
y ahora quiere que se la eche dentro el frasco
yo no fallo mami voy a serte franco
si te preo te mantengo con lo blanco
oye baby cunto quieres toma
cuando me chambea la pieza ella sabe que se detona
que irona tas feliz porque ese totito le llora
siempre me grita uuu si me escucha en el remix de roa
dame tag y te reposteo

campeona ven agarra tu trofeo
tiene jevo el cabron es hasta feo
y si algn da se entera que estuvimo avsale que no boxeo
que lo mo son las rpidas
y que la movie de l no se la creo
dale tcate por facetime vamo a empezar el bellakeo
que yo soy tu ejecutivo
de contact me tiene ceo
voy penetrando tu zona
me pone un topping en la punta y lo decora
oye beb decora
si te quedas te llevo pa bora bora
dice que se vuelve loca si me escucha en la emisora
un pinta labios que se lo compr en sephora
esa baby es sencilla se conforma con pandora
y le compr un ap pa que le brille ms la hora
eso e audemars piguet
llama a un pal de amigas vamos a cuadrar un get
ese culo a mi me puso bellako y se lo apliqu
no soy tu prncipe azul yo las cambio como piqu
yo soy un player en el prime
t solo invita mami que yo estoy online
le llego con la z y con una botella e wine
y el polvo repetimos siempre le damos rewind

le doy por la baldo a medio chambn
yo me lo saco ella sola cant
una pobre diabla yo the last don
llamando por facetime la amiga
quin sabe quizs se la ponga a las dos
un chin en el belly un chin en el peli
le digo beb dime dnde falt
los senos recin operao
la muerdo y le dejo una marca como el 700 haciendo burnout
pa la disco seguro sala
pero preferimo quedarno encerrauw
el cabrn de tu jevo te escribe rochao aoaoao
y yo aprovechao aoaoao

coro

cuando ella se trepa en el tubo y me baila me hace el 3 6 0 como carter vince
venirse era un sueo y yo soy freddy krueger cuando la mato dentro el dream
baby
me siento lento no se si es el veneno en tus labios o lean
la llevo pal west sin las kanye chinga como kardashian porque es kim
bo
cuando estoy adentro me fabrica un caso porque la tengo cumpliendo una condena
sus piernas en mi cuello es un cierre en diamantes se lo meto y me agarra por las cadenas
tiene el alma fra aunque la eleve al cielo le gusta el pecado y su cuerpo se quema
ya sali el 66 en compaa del lobo traite una amiguita que hoy hay luna llena
me pego a su piel como fragancia
ella ta en declive como torre e francia
se da deo si estamos a distancia
la choco y termina en ambulancia
sentimiento maldad y elegancia
le gusta mi arrogancia
porque en el culo no le invert un peso pero tengo el toto de ganancia
que t quieres baby que te coma toa
que te baje el panty como rollin door 
te lo hago en el bao en la cama o el floor
toi 2 a 0 arriba en el score
en el infierno soy tu baby goat
ella es una serpiente como las boa
gane un disco e oro con el primer verso atetentamente el 66 con roa

coro

it will be great to see more densely packed cities gta 5 definitely does feel empty sometimes especially in places where it will normally be crowded
wow this breakdown is spot on and detailed kudos to folks from ign team who researched every single bit
its crazy that even as adults this still make us feel like kids again 
surprisingly this trailer has given so many people a reason to be happy and stay hopeful this is what the world needs love rockstar and thank you ign for a meticulous break down of that beautiful trailer
this is a crazy breakdown it emphasizes just how much care was put into the video and game assets in a way that id never appreciate watching the video without this breakdown
hats off to ign for doing the heavy lifting with this level of meticulous research these trailer breakdowns reveal so much about a game
maybe the ancle monitor is a creative way to limit the players explorable area in the beginning like rockstar did in previous gta games if so this would be incredible creative 
credit to tachyonv for the fan map creation
ive watched like 5 or 6 of these trailer breakdowns and this is by far the best one thanks to the folks at ign for putting in the time and effort to provide alot of fun context to the background elements that others missed 
it will be great to see more densely packed cities
in the wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes we had a hurricane in the first vice city would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen
thrilled to finally share a glimpse of the incredible world weve been crafting in gta vi cant wait for players to experience the next level of immersive storytelling and gameplay stay tuned for more excitement ahead
making a game like this requires recreating a culture from real life very accurately but also adding just enough exaggeration to make it exciting interesting and fun for the player striking that balance between accuracy and excitement factor has got to feel impossible but somehow rockstar does it perfectly every time its amazing
the attention to detail is stunning and mind blowing
wow rockstar you guys did it
crazy how far the grand thief auto series has come iv played every single one and they continue to blow our minds
the amount of detail they packed into just the first trailer and into the vice city world has me so hyped
well done on all the details spotted  its amazing how much details one can pick out from just a trailer one can only imagine how many more we will find in future trailers and ingame too

just a note  the song running down a dream was featured in san andreas not vice city

im glad to see google back in the game this looks next level
very impressive want to try it
fyi this is embellished a bit its still extremely cool and impressive and i am so excited to see these advances but theres a fair amount they have to do to get to this exact state in a viral video demonstrating geminis capabilities google took significant artistic license it showed a user speaking with gemini but was actually representing a text conversation it showed a moving video but was feeding gemini still images it showed fast responses but sped those up it showed tight model outputs but shortened them for brevity it showed brief prompts eliciting terrific answers but listed longer prompts in a blog post  from big technlology by alex kantrowitz
the realtime element is by far the most impressive these sorts of asynchronous interactions are what ai has been missing thus far
just one problem the video isnt real we created the demo by capturing footage in order to test geminis capabilities on a wide range of challenges then we prompted gemini using still image frames from the footage and prompting via text parmy olsen at bloomberg was the first to report the discrepancy
that is incredibly impressive there were clearly some hidden prompts as it kept understanding switching contexts but still it was highly impressive
im just looking forward to when they hook up this kind of ai into one of those boston dynamics robots and we can finally have robot servants we can talk to like we always dreamed of in scifi it increasingly feels like we are finally living in the future like we expected we would by the year 2000
when this is really working as being shown it is indeed mindblowing great job
cant wait to try itwith all the understanding this model is able to do its just amazing
very impressive i didnt expect this kind of thing so early it just has been a year since ai war started and we come this far
unfortunately what you see is not at all what happened the ai does not actually reply to the person but to a script and pictures containing sometimes more information than we are shown here
wow gemini is incredibly impressive the combination of multimodal capabilities and its ability to interact with different formats like text images and even code is truly groundbreaking i especially loved the showcase of visual puzzles and image  text generation this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with ai and open up new possibilities for learning and creative expression
its truly fascinating to see what ai is now capable of
this is incredible now if we can combine this with an embodied agent that can navigate through the world plan out sequences of actions from interactions with the user and use rl to learn from mistakes and learn about the user that would be gg
i cant imagine the amount of data used to train gemini this is next level and if it has open ais new voice type then this will be the greatest multimodal ai
its kinda crazy how intelligent this ai is on the fly and is considered a basic model by them the stuff they have behind the scenes is far more advanced
i find this mindblowing although what im more exited about what is going to happen next for the past year openai has been without competition so they have probably not been in full gear now that google and openai have caught on it sure to mean an ai race is going to start with a ridicolous speed of progress
fascinating  i cant wait to see what weve accomplished in another 5 years
this has a lot of potential as an ai workbench for your child to replace their entire education from kindergarten to university",28,Science & Technology,11400000,PT6M23S,"['absolutely mindblowing the amount understanding the model exhibit here way way beyond anything else', 'glad see google back the game this look next level', 'very impressive want try', 'fyi this embellished bit still extremely cool and impressive and excited see these advance but there fair amount they have get this exact state viral video demonstrating gemini capability google took significant artistic license showed user speaking with gemini but actually representing text conversation showed moving video but feeding gemini still image showed fast response but sped those showed tight model output but shortened them for brevity showed brief prompt eliciting terrific answer but listed longer prompt blog post from big technlology alex kantrowitz', 'the realtime element far the most impressive these sort asynchronous interaction are what been missing thus far', 'just one problem the video not_ real created the demo capturing footage order test gemini capability wide range challenge then prompted gemini using still image frame from the footage and prompting via text parmy olsen bloomberg the first report the discrepancy', 'that incredibly impressive there were clearly some hidden prompt kept understanding switching context but still highly impressive', 'just looking forward when they hook this kind into one those boston dynamic robot and can finally have robot servant can talk like always dreamed scifi increasingly feel like are finally living the future like expected would the year 2000', 'when this really working being shown indeed mindblowing great job', 'cannot wait try itwith all the understanding this model able just amazing', 'very impressive did not_ expect this kind thing early just been year since war started and come this far', 'unfortunately what you see not_ all what happened the doe not_ actually reply the person but script and picture containing sometimes more information than are shown here', 'wow gemini incredibly impressive the combination multimodal capability and ability interact with different format like text image and even code truly groundbreaking especially loved the showcase visual puzzle and image text generation this technology the potential revolutionize the way interact with and open new possibility for learning and creative expression', 'truly fascinating see what now capable', 'this incredible now can combine this with embodied agent that can navigate through the world plan out sequence action from interaction with the user and use learn from mistake and learn about the user that would', 'cannot imagine the amount data used train gemini this next level and open new voice type then this will the greatest multimodal', 'kind crazy how intelligent this the fly and considered basic model them the stuff they have behind the scene far more advanced', 'find this mindblowing although what more exited about what going happen next for the past year openai been without competition they have probably not_ been full gear now that google and openai have caught sure mean race going start with ridicolous speed progress', 'fascinating cannot wait see what have accomplished another year', 'this lot potential workbench for your child replace their entire education from kindergarten university']",383

 judo sloth gaming is a mobile gaming channel focused on clash of clans you will see a variety of videos focused on being educational but entertaining you will find informational guides on everything in coc attack strategies 3 star attacks farming or upgrade advice lets play and update news  youll want to subscribe to see it all clash on",3808,"as a th11 i can confidently say that ill be excited for this update in around a decade
moment of silence for those who still havent hit townhall 15 yet
subscribe for all the update sneak peeks what are your thoughts on the th16 nature theme design

i beat clash of clans with a broken account httpsyoutubesxck13hstf0sikxomcu5mjc3jtfb
in my opinion the th 16 theme is like a combination of the natural themes of th 14 the luxury of th 11 and the fiery red of th 10
the ability to attack against yourself is probably the biggest improvement the practice potential is limitless
i really love the aesthetic of the th16 after all those magical futuristic theme we go back to nature theme and its kinda refreshing
epic update judo 
its really nice to see that they reduced the upgrade times upgrade times at th16 are like 5 days less than the current th15 upgrades
you know im actually very happy about this color design the last few have always been these overly ecstatic colors and this one is more regal its a nice change of pace in my opinion
one interesting thing i noticed is that there was just one archer on the archer tower at 752 
we might be getting a merge defenses option and the number of archers on the archer tower might indicate something maybe like when we merge 2 towers it will show two archers on it
the option for self attacks in friendly challenges is really cool seems very fun and very helpful for trying out attacks and bases 
i personally think with the entirety of nature being the theme at their disposal they did miss out on an opportunity to have a much cooler wall design but i like the theme overall 
i feel like the skill gap and level will increase tremendously after the attacking your own base change people will be practicing a whole lot more often
4 on trending youve come so far judo thanks for entertaining me all these years you got me back into this game and i couldnt be any happier i cant wait for th16 even though im a th14 
the ability to attack yourself is going to be a game changer considering the friendly army doesnt need training time the practice potential it has is just amazing especially for casual players like me who doesnt bother with a 12 step hybrid attack strat the top clans and players are also major beneficiaries of this im sure well be seeing all kinds of new attack strats soon after the update
im excited but as a max th15 it kinda feels a little early i feel like a lot of people are still trying to grind out th15 th14 and even th13 should be a lot of fun the magical items help so much makes a big difference in wait times
suprisingly im actually looking forward to the self challenge feature the most rather than the electro and balloon new upgrade this will will a huge boon as i always wanted to practice against other level 15 townhalls although soon other level 16 townhalls
my best guess for new troop is an elf dryad or a nature summoner hope well see two new building in action and more interaction
i believe the new troop will be a druid th 15 introduced the electro titan which fit very well with its theme
im glad that this update has features that will be cool for other town halls too like the attack yourself option",20,Gaming,2730000,PT13M42S,"['th11 can confidently say that ill excited for this update around decade', 'moment silence for those who still have not_ hit townhall yet', 'subscribe for all the update sneak peek what are your thought the th16 nature theme design', '', 'beat clash clan with broken account', 'opinion the theme like combination the natural theme the luxury and the fiery red', 'the ability attack against yourself probably the biggest improvement the practice potential limitless', 'really love the aesthetic the th16 after all those magical futuristic theme back nature theme and kind refreshing', 'epic update judo', 'really nice see that they reduced the upgrade time upgrade time th16 are like day than the current th15 upgrade', 'you know actually very happy about this color design the last few have always been these overly ecstatic color and this one more regal nice change pace opinion', 'one interesting thing noticed that there just one archer the archer tower 752', 'might getting merge defense option and the number archer the archer tower might indicate something maybe like when merge tower will show two archer', 'the option for self attack friendly challenge really cool seems very fun and very helpful for trying out attack and base', 'personally think with the entirety nature being the theme their disposal they did miss out opportunity have much cooler wall design but like the theme overall', 'feel like the skill gap and level will increase tremendously after the attacking your own base change people will practicing whole lot more often', 'trending you have come far judo thanks for entertaining all these year you got back into this game and could not_ any happier cannot wait for th16 even though th14', 'the ability attack yourself going game changer considering the friendly army doe not_ need training time the practice potential just amazing especially for casual player like who doe not_ bother with step hybrid attack strat the top clan and player are also major beneficiary this sure well seeing all kind new attack strats soon after the update', 'excited but max th15 kind feel little early feel like lot people are still trying grind out th15 th14 and even th13 should lot fun the magical item help much make big difference wait time', 'suprisingly actually looking forward the self challenge feature the most rather than the electro and balloon new upgrade this will will huge boon always wanted practice against other level townhalls although soon other level townhalls', 'best guess for new troop elf dryad nature summoner hope well see two new building action and more interaction', 'believe the new troop will druid introduced the electro titan which fit very well with theme', 'glad that this update feature that will cool for other town hall too like the attack yourself option']",822

this was an unexpected turn for the schedule but i would genuinely feel bad not screaming out the black parade exists
the absolute best line from the faq in the docs for this custom campaign

q are you guys fans of my chemical romance
a no this is what happens when you think you have a cool name and dont google it beforehand
i love the thief video series the game is two decades old but it is one of the most creative and fun retro games you can play
damn this mod looks amazing it fills my heart knowing theres a dedicated group of old thief fans like myself making love letters to this legendary trilogy the scale of the maps is unreal and i wanna get lost in them snagging loot cant wait to play this
you know smth is gonna be good when mandalore resurrects the mod spotlight series to talk about it

seriously though would love to see you cover more mods on games
this man will do absolutely anything to avoid making the thief 4 video
i was given the honor of betatesting this absolute behemoth and all i can say to my fellow thief fans is go play it if you want to experience thief as if it was the first time
1123 what are you so frightened of come to me
it was seriously a privilege to have gotten to do voicework and later betatest this beast i will forever be in awe of the dedication and craft of the team hope you enjoyed my contribution and may the city never die
i can only imagine how proud someone must be who as a creator made a game with the technology they had available at the time and then 25 years later the fans of that which you have created have been compelled enough to carry forward and expand upon your work with this scale
blessed be the mod makers i salute you all for your community service if only you could create as much as you wish hopefully the artists wont starve some day
every time thief content reaches broad audience it feels like something to celebrate
how crazy is this the mod solidifies lore from multiple games i would love for all companies to take so much care of their ips make them deeper fix problems etc this mod should be a template for all sequels 

i think gaming lost a lot when the concept of expansions died the same engine more missions more lore just more this mod is clear proof how much value this concept can add without pushing the games technology too much further
once again mandy proves to be the saviour of the broken defeated and the damned and also signalboosting one of the coolest things to come out of the modding scene this year

i should really get into this after arcane dimensions and also wizordum
it was a privilege to be able to contribute to this its truly a landmark in the thief community and all the new developments on display are going to be a real game changer the same way thief 2x was all the way back in 2005
daily reminder that everyone should check out the dark mod its an standalone total conversion of doom 3 thats thief but legally distinct and it has an active community of thief veterans that make missions throughout the year for a free fan game its an impressive testament of how passionate the thief modding community is even when the franchise is dead
i always love to see thief fan missions represented there are a ton of extremely high quality levels im like 3 levels into this one and its fantastic always love to see lady rowena represented after her passing she was a sublime map maker

weve got our hands on the allnew tesla cybertruck and its lining up alongside the a lamborghini urus but which will come out on top  petrol or electric 

well lets check out the stats starting with the cybertruck it rolls up equipped with three electric motors and they combine to produce 845hp and 930nm of torque the starting price of the dualmotor edition is around 49000 but for this trimotor cyberbeast edition itll cost you around 96000 in terms of weight the cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes it also has a top speed of 130mph 

then we have the lambo its packing a 4litre twinturbo v8 under the bonnet and this can produce 650hp and 850nm of torque power is sent to all four wheels via an 8speed torque converter gearbox and its a whole lot lighter than the tesla tipping the scales at 2200kg it also has a much bigger top speed coming in at 190mph 

so the cybertruck has the urus beat when it comes to performance stats but will the extra weight drag it down theres only one way to find out for sure lets race",10243,"what has the world come to a lamborghini losing a race to a polygon
obviously the cybertruck has lesser polygons and so it render and thus runs faster
one could imagine how much it breaks yannis heart to see the urus lose like that
cyber truck is a beast but the everyday people wont be able to afford it

to see something so big moving so fast is just insane
gutted i was not there for this
its often easy to know which car wins even before they race 98 of the time its the car matt is driving 
you can imagine how sad yanni was when he saw the urus team losing the game like this
its easy to predict which car will win in your drag races mat  it is always the car you are driving 
i noticed in the last video and in this one too that the cybertruck appears to have a slow start in the first 18 to 14 second to prevent any wheel spin then the full power is applied once the tires are connectedand from that point it just goes
i wonder if matt will ever be allowed to use a pagani for anything even just a review or something would be amazing to see i think hed have a great time with something like that
it has great design and amazing new technologies
matthew likes the idea of winning he has to be in a faster vehicle even if they swap cars he has to go back to the faster one
i wish i could be one of the construction workers there on lunch break watching you guys race i am sure they are placing bets out there

oh dont let anything start to trend on social media  its over from that there

music
oddwin  19",2757,"if this video gets popular i will stop smiling
i have a weird lovehate relationship with fandoms sometimes theyre the life blood of keeping a series going but they also attract people who have nothing to do with the fandom except diss on it
imma be so mad if this video gets popular this is such a small community and i dont want outsiders ruining it
seen it happen to tv shows movies music artists even certain video games i honestly wonder what makes some ppl hate something good just because its popular
this is so accurate there are just some people that hate stuff because they want to be different to the majority its really weird you dont need to like it too but imagine changing your opinion on something from positive to negative because its popular
dont look away take accountability whats wromg with you
i felt that im my damn soul bro
this is a common phenomenon what happens is that when a show gets really popular people will start saying they dislike it specifically to be contrarian the reasoning behind why they do this is because they want to be seen as different or special compared to everyone else since everyone else likes it

true individuality is having complex and well thought out opinions on things not simply disagreeing with the majority
this is so true people base their opinions off of media and situations and not on what they actually feel about the show
that little pose of when you hear something so frustrating you have to convulse and experience physical pain before carrying with the conversation was so damn accurate 
its even worse when they try and guilt trip you for liking the show when they were the ones who introduced you to it in the first place 
i dont know how you can so accurately portray such absurd moments youve got a gift
ive heard people explain the reason they start to hate something thats popular is because they will constantly see and hear about it i suppose even if you like something it can get boring or even irritating if its constantly shoved in your face kinda like eating the same food over and over eventually you get sick of it
i personally love when something i love becomes popular that just means theres more people to share the love with and if everyone loves it it must be that good
im glad the goat of skits is back also i can relate to this video hard i love this vid i think caleb should be in a legit movie kinda like coryxkenshin also calebs on a roll with the google sponsors nice job
this is so damn true im glad that some underrated stuff gets more recognition but at the same time it sucks because youll have a superior group that does stuff like in the video
relatable absurd i love how much caleb can communicate with just a head nod or a gesture
and i love the totally unnecessary armflailing when jordan runs off
thats why i disassociate myself from popular things so i can diss them without guilt then 5 years later i watch and inevitably enjoy them after all the hype is over brilliant strategy
man caleb even after all these years your videos are still bangers i dont know how you think these up keep up the great work
as much as i hate to say it this is relatable i tend to like something early on and almost every time it ends up being enjoyed by everyone then i started to hate the community of the thing because it has less nuance and personality now like the fact that people are around the thing i like makes me not want to be around the thing i like which over time has lead me to express interest in things a little more fringe and underground that would be hard for the masses to spotlight i still like these things i just avoid them whenever people start talking about it because i almost dont want to burn out on the things i like i believe the accepted term for this phenomenon is being a bitch ass hipster

even worse theres been a recent sighting of a wicked powerful sorceress chameleon oscar winner viola davis a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature large or small and chameleon has her greedy beady little eyes on pos staff of wisdom which would give her the power to resummon all the master villains whom po has vanquished to the spirit realm 

so pos going to need some help he finds it kinda in the form of crafty quickwitted thief zhen golden globe winner awkwafina a corsac fox who really gets under pos fur but whose skills will prove invaluable in their quest to protect the valley of peace from chameleons reptilian claws this comedic oddcouple duo will have to work together in the process po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places 

the film features the voice talent of returning stars academy award winner dustin hoffman as kung fu master shifu james hong everything everywhere all at once as pos adoptive father mr ping academy award nominee bryan cranston as pos birth father li and emmy award nominee ian mcshane as tai lung shifus former student and archnemesis oscar winner ke huy quan everything everywhere all at once joins the ensemble as a new character han the leader of the den of thieves

this looks incredible when we say we want the visuals this is what we mean 
i havent gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years  this can only be seen properly in theatre
denis villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed also the fact that theyve built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love denis and the team have for the process
this film stands as the cinematic masterpiece weve been yearning for elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights its impact on the scifi genre is unprecedented setting a new benchmark for future endeavors
but i do see a way there is a narrow way through i absolutely love the way he said that line im so excited for this movie
this film is the cinematic brilliance weve been waiting for for decades it really takes movie making to another level i really dont think there is any scifi series like this one is showing up to be
by far one of the finest movie trailer in recent years the build up is just so powerful and aweinspiring especially with the gorgeous music denis seems to have outdone himself with this one this is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope it is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years he is also the new master of intelligent and profound sciencefiction films i mean arrival blade runner 2049 dune part one dune part 2 and most probably following next will be rendezvous with rama and dune messiah an amazingly talented artist
that silence gave me serious chills i had to watch it again cant wait to see the actual scene 
this is not a movie this is pure art
how the heck does denis villeneuve deliver yet another classic that works so ridiculously well this day and age incredible i am just hoping he does more projects similar to this taking an oldie and bringing it to the modern audience
im a huge fan of the dune universe and i absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books theres also a game in development called dune awakening so i love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 
this movie franchise is a work of art love the books love everything about part i part ii is a must see
princess irulan looks like a prisoner of fate you can tell the team behind this is on the next level when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a characters costume embodies their story
yessssss    throughout the trailer i had goosebumps bigger than i have ever had clean to the end and even after   i dont think i have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does
since the first dune movie ive been obsessed best stuff that has come out of hollywood in years villeneuve and hans zimmer go hand in hand here cause it was the first time i came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score my spotify top 5 of 23 is all dune  hats off and i really look forward to dune 2 not less than how i looked forward to the return of the king 20 years ago
absolutely blown away by this trailer the visuals storyline and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters cant wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen
major goosebumps everything about this looks incredible i loved part 1 and im all in for part 2  i just wish i could watch it now
the cinematic event ive been waiting for dune will win best director editor cinematographer music costume and vfx if it doesnt then i dont know what should this is a pure labour of love i would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does cannot wait
denis villeneuve is an absolute master  ive loved all of his movies this will be incredible just like part 1 was",1,Film & Animation,11300000,PT2M40S,"['let honest denis villeneuve the music the trailer just epic one the best trailer have seen year', 'this look incredible when say want the visuals this what mean', 'have not_ gotten actual goosebump body because film year this can only seen properly theatre', 'denis villeneuve deserves lot respect for being brave enough take such project considering how many dune movie failed also the fact that they have built everything especially the era green screen movie show how much love denis and the team have for the process', 'this film stand the cinematic masterpiece have been yearning for elevating storytelling unprecedented height impact the scifi genre unprecedented setting new benchmark for future endeavor', 'but see way there narrow way through absolutely love the way said that line excited for this movie', 'this film the cinematic brilliance have been waiting for for decade really take movie making another level really not_ think there any scifi series like this one showing', 'far one the finest movie trailer recent year the build just powerful and aweinspiring especially with the gorgeous music denis seems have outdone himself with this one this going incredible movie experience filled with emotion and hope amazing that director can make such quality motion picture one after the other and releasing almost one every two year also the new master intelligent and profound sciencefiction film mean arrival blade runner 2049 dune part one dune part and most probably following next will rendezvous with rama and dune messiah amazingly talented artist', 'that silence gave serious chill had watch again cannot wait see the actual scene', 'this not_ movie this pure art', 'how the heck doe denis villeneuve deliver yet another classic that work ridiculously well this day and age incredible just hoping doe more project similar this taking oldie and bringing the modern audience', 'huge fan the dune universe and absolutely love the atmospheric translation these movie from the book there also game development called dune awakening love how are finally giving this universe the attention deserves', 'this movie franchise work art love the book love everything about part part must see', 'princess irulan look like prisoner fate you can tell the team behind this the next level when they think everything through thoroughly that even character costume embodies their story', 'yes throughout the trailer had goosebump bigger than have ever had clean the end and even after not_ think have ever seen movie trailer that the edge emotional seat like this one doe', 'since the first dune movie have been obsessed best stuff that come out hollywood year villeneuve and han zimmer hand hand here because the first time came out cinema absolute awe the score spotify top all dune hat off and really look forward dune not_ than how looked forward the return the king year ago', 'absolutely blown away this trailer the visuals storyline and suspense have eagerly counting down the day until this movie hit theater cannot wait experience this epic adventure the big screen', 'major goosebump everything about this look incredible loved part and all for part just wish could watch now', 'the cinematic event have been waiting for dune will win best director editor cinematographer music costume and vfx doe not_ then not_ know what should this pure labour love would like thank favourite director all time for inspiring with everything doe cannot wait', 'denis villeneuve absolute master have loved all his movie this will incredible just like part']",160

lol nice animation
loved seeing nabiu with a doortal at 533 cant wait for the pilot
510 all things considered ganon using his own health bar as a weapon is metal asf
rauru it would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi 

link wing shield jumps disrespectfully
the five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
i love the ending where it seems that link is going to save zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until link realizes that the speedrun is over
i dont know what zelda told rauru about linkbut he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
i appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and i appreciate that you gave it some meaning and the ganondorf fight was next level
i already knew he couldnt get wrecked like the other endbosses because of suavemente but i never would have expected that his weakness was no suavemente 
also i laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon
in all its accurate to the source material and continue what you do best
the fact that ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and i love it 
the life ending neck cracks throughout the terminal montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
when ganon started  dancing suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears love the details 
merry christmas  jeremy big hugs to you and the team i love your work 
all the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing ive been waiting for this one for a while
gotta love how link doesnt even bother trying to save zelda the first time then doesnt even visibly question or react beyond the mandated qte to the fact that shes suddenly appeared out of nowhere in freefall and still leaves her to take a dunk in the lake 
425 this is my favorite moment you can feel links determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
a rush of dopamine always hits hard every time i enjoy the chaos of another video 

also i love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol
421 i cant imagine how terrified that bokoblin mustve been he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing hyah sounds and then link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
your animations will never get old
325 as much as i find the gloom hands to be terrifying i would imagine it would be cool if ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack lookout landing it wouldnt add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like ganondorf was more of a threat
447 is seriously the coolest attack animation youve ever done

ufc",2092,"brandon royval just casually running 10 miles at 65minute pace is impressive dude has excellent cardio
leons first nfl game was one of the worst scoring games ever  30
my takeaways from this
i am absolutely exhausted watching pantoja workout what a demon
paddy catches a lot of shit when hes away from a hot mic regarding fighting he seems like a good guy
as an american i want to apologize to leon for attending that awful fuckin nfl game
heart says wonderboy 
brain says shavkat 
watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art shit is so impressive man
tony is 06 yet i still cant wait for his appearance on the embedded

guy really is a legend and a hell of an entertainer hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens
100 respect colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class how can you not respect it
you gotta respect colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class half of the champions in the ufc or more dont fight at their normal weight class
you can tell that colby is a good guy and just plays a character seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter  people have to separate the ppv selling colby from the person he seems to be
the flash of genuine colby when they brought out the candles you could tell he loved that
still makes me sad pantoja got booed after he won the belt he left it all in the octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears dad are your proud of me now  

i like both brandon and alexandre but im rooting for alexandre
you just cant hate thompson so humble
so pumped to see colby back in action the guy is a true gem of the sport hate or love him hes thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the octagon
really rooting for colby to get it done he is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat colby twice decisively
not a colby fan but i respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport he seems to always be in fighting shape he has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
thing i love the most about colby is he doesnt cut much weight maybe 4 kilos he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
cool seeing colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment this card is gonna be a banger

music by epidemic sound httpwwwepidemicsoundcom  others",906,"seeing chris throw the ball at harrys mom has to be one of the wildest things ive ever seen 
bidstrup took it like a legend huge respect
editwtf i checked my phone cuz i thought this comment got 1 like 
its always a long wait for a new video from chris but when it finally arrives its a piece of cinematic gold
the video weve all been waiting for let us know if you wanna play for us soon 
to everyone in the comments check out our channel for more chris vs mads content 
i swear harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 
bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
you notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round they are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge small things but big differences
manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
chris dashing the ball at w2s mum brought it to another level 
awesome to see levi colwill in this video met him when sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against hamworthy united
the pros were all really down to earth thats cool to see
the way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
bidstrups a class guy seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to gurnsey to record that clip with harrys mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
chris is one of the best youtube football dribblers he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still wont preform the same in a charity match
crazy that bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is di maria  benfica has just won 31 salzburg
di maria scoring a corner goal absolutely insaneee

good bye large cameraman your heroic act will never be forgotten 
this series never disappoints cool
looks like the cameraman found the skibidi lab bases sound like this is gonna be an interesting episode
mad respect for the large cameraman he risked his life for recording 67 from 14 now  he is in peace you will be remembered man
press f to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman
rest in peace large cameraman 
you were loved and you helped the cameraman find the factory and protected everyone 
you will be missed
gran cmaraman tiene mis respetos muri como un gran guerrero que hasta el final protegi a sus compaeros si dudar 
rest in peacelarge cameraman youve been a brave soldieryou will never be forgotten
presione f para presentar sus respetos al camargrafo grande l era el punto de vista del episodio 67 merece respeto por sacrificarse
agora sim o dafuqboom se surpreendeu no roteiro deixou os tits de lado e mostrou o que os personagens secundrios so capazes os personagens vo morrendo aos poucos na fbrica dos skibidis isso  insano e tenso epica luta a desse episdio
this almost made me cry rip large cameraman  rpg he will always be remembered and be in our hearts we only got to see him in the previous episode same as 66 also with his last lives he still did a thumbs up still in pain
respect to that large cameraman rest in peace
dafuq as i didnt see almost anyone talking im going to say you probably wont see this video but it doesnt matter im sending my strength to you man every time i go into the comments i see people talking about how the video is or so saying that you are no longer the same im not saying that this second is all of them but anyway i came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us and for what you have to go through with rude comments i dont know how you are behind that screen but i hope you are well they will probably tell me if anyone sees this you deserve a rest man take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity go out with your friends and go to a place to rest your mind well i just said that because im really worried about your psychology all the work you do when it comes to being private motherfucker saying skibidi skibidi all the time and in return getting insults that youre not the same anymore thats it probably no one will read this but its here now im less worried
what i love about episode 68 is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also rip large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
dude the large characters are the underappreciated heroes seeing as the large speakerman died then the large cameraman that might mean that large tv man is next on the chopping block rip large cameraman
wow inspiring to say the least a year ago today i was standing on a 351849 mile long sandwich  which too be fair had no mustard and was about to eat it all  this video along with the tuna song saved me

big respect for you guys to give a spotlight of this issue
now is definitely not the time to be buying a car average car cost 47k thats insane
check your ego at the door  you need a vehicle to get back and forth to work not to impress anyone an auto finance rate of 7 is an insult to anyone with excellent credit no thanks those new cars can sit on the lot and rot away for all i care
dealing with the dealerships is bad enough for small issues my father had to fight a year for a replacement engine under factory warranty for oil consumption but raise the stakes to the cost of a new ev battery and these stories are heartbreaking and disastrous i was an avid ev supporter until recent years im now very convinced the auto industry is screwing this up thank you for covering kyles story
wow  i remember all the uproar about people having to pay 26k on a 100k  tesla model s battery replacement  this is just next level
thanks kyle for reaching out to andrea and zach thank you andrea and zach for shedding light on this awful situation that is bound to snowball industry wide in the years to come im glad youve acted as an advocate and brought your notable presence to this guys terrible experience  what a nightmare best wishes kyle
id like zach and andrea giving me all of my news not just for car stuff i really appreciate the way they followed this from start to finish
excellent video as always you guys poor kyle i feel for him

im an old guy and honestly i just dont understand this rush to go to ev andor hybrid vehicles i get to save the environment i get fuel cost i get all of those things but lets face it cars today and trucks for that matter are so much more fuel efficient than they were back when i first started driving in the 80s i think of the very first car i owned a 1978 chevrolet monte carlo with a big honkin v8 in it that used leaded fuel lol

i realize im probably being somewhat hyperbolic but the reality is and your channel validates this consumers are buying big honking suvs and great big cars and trucks to haul their family or stuff around its just ridiculous

if we want to make the world a safer cleaner and more environmentally friendly place lets build  more little honda civic hatchbacks like we used to do back in the day thats all anybody really needs all these soccer moms that i see at my local school dropping kids off and picking kids up every day in giant pick up trucks and suv and sitting for 10 or 15 minutes with their engines idling makes me laugh 

no one seems too concerned about the environment when theyre making the school run lol

electric vehicles will probably get there someday and there will be teething problems however at this point i just dont think enough analysis has really been done to the cause and effect of the switch to consumers and to the environment

what is the cost going to be to bring more hydro electricity plants online where is that power going to come from

whats the economic impact going to be to consumers employers and companies as we move from fossil fuels to electricity how many thousands or even millions of people may potentially be out of work what impact does that have to the global economy how does that affect the environment

anyway sorry for the rant you guys are amazing love the channel
i agree with andrea im sure hyundai is not the only brand with disappointments i was in the market for an ev but i was hesitant i stuck to ice after hearing similar stories on these batteries being the major cost of any ev new or old im gonna continue to wait the anxiety may not just be range but bankruptcy as well great content motormouth you are a great source of information
mad props for helping out a fellow canadian it is absolutely ridiculous that this happened to him thank you for helping him out and hopefully he gets some justice out of the situation no ones insurance should have to suffer over something like this
im glad kyles story made it into publics eye there are many cases like his that happen quite often and big corporations just take advantage of these hard working people
thank you for reporting on this matter this is a risk i would not have anticipated it is fair to say that this type of road hazard will be present for all canadian drivers i am a bit surprised about how the matter was treated by the insurance provider it doesnt seem reasonable to reassess kyle as a high risk operator and double his coverage cost for the next ten years
thank you folks for bringing this to our attention this is shocking to say the least and i am very disappointed at how all of this was handled how can anyone justify the price of that replacement battery shady deal
the key here to me is what they both pointed out it is pretty hard to deny the price of the battery when it is shown with a part number who wants to take a wild guess at how many phone calls and dealership visits are going to be made over the next few days asking for a quote to replace the battery of their new ev i know one who will be making the call thank you both and thank you to kyle for this info
its good to make consumers aware of this thank you for sharing it seems unjustifiable that the replacement battery costs 56k the entire car when new cost about that which included the battery so it sounds like hyundai is putting a massive markup on replacement batteries they really need to explain that i feel really bad for this guy hes financially screwed no matter what he does in this situation this is a good lesson to learn about being an early adopter of new technology it doesnt come cheaply
this video and story is both heartbreaking for kyle and also a fantastic psa thank you for sharing this
thank you for exposing this and sharing such an illogical and frustrating story we need to hold these corrupt companies responsible and demand better service warranties and right to repair that serve the customer lets just say this for what it is  this so called green vehicle saving on emissions etc is a singleuse vehicle if the battery costs more than the entire vehicle brand new hyundaikia has created a disposable vehicle
so glad the two of you are covering these aspects of car ownership that dont get enough publicity
thank you andrea zach and kyle for sharing this story for us all  kudos really hope hyundai does right by kyle and quickly

kratos is not just the god of warbut he is nowthe god of hope
kratos the spartan the god of war and most importantly the father of boy is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts
theres something eerie about seeing a younger kratos in this modern light ive grown to love the older kratos but at the same time you are terrified of the younger kratos
the god of war becomes the god of hope i think we can all agree that kratos deserved this ending more than anything
everyones talking about young kratos and rightfully so but can we give a round of applause for tyr the fact we got to fight him not once but four times was amazing and that last encounter pure awesome
that young kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look they did great job in representing young wild kratos who still doesnt seem to understand what was going on with him at that point
if old kratos hates himself from the past you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed what an absolute legend
seeing tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more he truly has traveled a lot
kratos really came full circle he became the god of hope when all else was lost he still found hope to move on im happy to see he never forgotten pandoras words
the size difference and the different vibes young kratos and old kratos have is amazing specially when young kratos moved from his pose it was so menacing
im not gonna lie i almost teared up watching this ending

mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational

definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way
looking at this scene i cant help but think how many times i have wanted to do the exact same thing kratos did staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young selfish stupid cruel and nothing more than a lowly piece of work but then realize how far i have come in my years i needed this more than anyone could realize kratos your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that i was in tears your story one of death destruction and chaos but also of love redemption and hope you bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question who am i we are who we choose to be both of our past and of our present
love how kratos finally confronts all his regrets and it hits hard

this is honestly christopher judges best performance i have ever seen the emotions the anger the hate and then the sadness to pure realisation in his voice honestly made me teary inside
this was such an emotional journey thank you so much to santa monica studio for this beautiful gift theyre amazing for this who agrees with me seeing young kratos meet with redeemed kratos facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light this hits home for me because i suffer with mental health disorders and seeing kratos face his younger self will be me when i recover
kratos confronting his younger self
in my head i picture that hes gaining closure with his bloodthirsty past and telling him that this is what he needed to become the god of hope the father of boy the god of redemption

suggestion the wolf armor could be colored with dyes like the leather pieces
i sincerely hope they make it so you can dye the wolf armour later on or maybe trim it or something
excited for the last big 121 announced feature so far in the armadillo and wolf armour very curious what will be coming in the rest of the update now 
the armadillo and wolf armour look great ingame didnt expect to see it done so soon
can it be enchanted can we dye it i hope they keep developing it so its a viable item to get for our dogs
suggestion can it be enchanted protection iv on wolf armour would be awesome
trust us to introduce a cuddly new mob and give it the yuckiest food imaginable 
fireflies
wolf armor and the armadillo are better than expected
suggestion can we enchant the armor like with thorns or even protection just to get the most out of it
finally a use for spider eyes other than brewing i wish they ate rotten flesh as well but i can just give those to the wolves
it would be cool to be able to upgrade it with a smithing table maybe even add trims being able to dye the armour is also something i see all over the comments ofc
aw sad to see the eye placement from the concept art not carry over it so much more accurate to what actual armadillos look like and would have looked so much cuterless goofy than the current iteration
we all thought it was gonna be like one defense but daimond armor for wolfs is sick
minecraft monthly has to be one of my favourite official minecraft shows vu is an amazing host 
ravines cliffs oceans and lava let us introduced ourselves

the biggest reason a wolf dies
i can finally bring my wolves on adventures instead of leaving them as a decoration in my house 
would be cool if you could put interments like protection 4 and blast protection or fire protection or why not all of them

honestly a solid game by the leafs great defence by beniotlaggessonmccabe and exactly the kind of defence we need if we are going into the playoffs with this core also big ups to jones for his first full game
another win and 2 more goals for matthews who now leads the league with 21 goals by canadas favourite team  glg 
matthews and mccabe were the stars tonight mccabe just deflated the rangers in the third and it was just a beautiful thing to watch reminiscent of todd gill wendel clark and darcy tucker  getting hits in when they are sorely needed
jonesy looked solid in net tonight made some big saves that really held us in there 
3 of 4 points in ny ill take it its even more impressive when you consider the leafs are missing 3 starting defencemen their 1 goalie and the flu is running through the entire leaf team right now go leafs go
hate the fact that my fav american team lost but love the fact my fav canadian team won go leafs go
this is why i like nylander and matthews together you let nylander dance find some open space then slide it over to matthews pure finisher
this is the kind of hockey you get when the leafs top lines are clicking
good  game rangers i almost had a leaf heart attack when it was 43
man this was a real statement win for the leafs down a first line forward half the d core is hurt third string goalie is playing and besides the second period clobbered one of the best teams in the nhl
never thought trouba would get the save of the week
i nearly had the classic leafs heart attack after period 2 but luckily it didnt end that way
mathews with 4 points and marty shut the door perfect
good game from the leafs and a stellar performance from martin jones
respecting nylander gives matthews  marner space to operate thats what happens when you do both shoot and pass at a high level
auston matterws is why i tune into toronto highlights
good push back by ny but toronto too much for them tonight
they should have dads trips more often and maybe even in the playoffs
        
i cant believe this leafs team what an amazing team they have become i lived in toronto for almost 30 years and remember the days of courtnall iafrate salming clarke domi and the rest of them the struggle they went through during those days was heartbreaking i moved to the uk 12 years ago and am so happy to see them doing so good",17,Sports,907000,PT10M25S,"['matthew his god mode right now taking more shot and paying off goal for papi take the goal scoring lead', 'honestly solid game the leaf great defence beniotlaggessonmccabe and exactly the kind defence need are going into the playoff with this core also big ups jones for his first full game', 'another win and more goal for matthew who now lead the league with goal canada favourite team glg', 'matthew and mccabe were the star tonight mccabe just deflated the ranger the third and just beautiful thing watch reminiscent todd gill wendel clark and darcy tucker getting hit when they are sorely needed', 'jonesy looked solid net tonight made some big save that really held there', 'point ill take even more impressive when you consider the leaf are missing starting defencemen their goalie and the flu running through the entire leaf team right now leaf', 'hate the fact that fav american team lost but love the fact fav canadian team won leaf', 'this why like nylander and matthew together you let nylander dance find some open space then slide over matthew pure finisher', 'this the kind hockey you get when the leaf top line are clicking', 'good game ranger almost had leaf heart attack when', 'man this real statement win for the leaf down first line forward half the core hurt third string goalie playing and besides the second period clobbered one the best team the nhl', 'never thought trouba would get the save the week', 'nearly had the classic leaf heart attack after period but luckily did not_ end that way', 'mathews with point and marty shut the door perfect', 'good game from the leaf and stellar performance from martin jones', 'respecting nylander give matthew marner space operate that what happens when you both shoot and pas high level', 'auston matterws why tune into toronto highlight', 'good push back but toronto too much for them tonight', 'they should have dad trip more often and maybe even the playoff', '', 'cannot believe this leaf team what amazing team they have become lived toronto for almost year and remember the day courtnall iafrate salming clarke domi and the rest them the struggle they went through during those day heartbreaking moved the year ago and happy see them doing good']",625

an actual high school problem arc is gonna be so sick i cant wait to see ayda interact with the other characters
freshman year came out when i was a freshman in high school sophomore year came out when i was a sophomore in high school and now junior year is coming our when i am a junior in college thank you dimension 20 you all mean the world to me
i still cant believe this is really gonna happen  fantasy high will always hold a very special place in my dd heart  cant wait to see what these 9thlevel chaos goblins get up to next  hoot growl baby
the last time we saw the bad kids the entire show and ally looked entirely different
calling it that riz has learned what rizz means and has become as suave as his angel father
fantasy high rolled a nat 20 on being alive and thats how junior year happened
im beyond pumped fantasy high freshman year was my comfort show during the pandemic
murph showing up each season with more arm tattoos is such a power move
finally we can wrap up the night yorb plot line
to quote my dd group this is our super bowl
i love those sketch drawings with everyones name card adaines especially
im so excited i might cry fantasy high was my introduction to not only dropout but dungeons and dragons as well i cant wait to see what the bad kids get up to in their junior year
i started watching fantasy high when the first two season had already been filmed i was going into my freshman year of highschool the summer i started i rewatched both seasons over and over i started dnd campaigns and watched all of the new dnd adventures as they came out in 2024 i graduate i have a plan to go to college to write a book one day this series and its actors have been integral to my growth and life throughout highschool and in my worst moments and exam seasons i have turned to them for a break a reminder than im not alone i cant express enough how much it means to me to see another season of this after all the changes and growth ive gone through
im in love with how visible the improvements in the set  budget are from fantasy high freshman year so excited to see the story of the original intrepid heroes continue
as someone who got into dimension 20 earlier this year i literally could not be happier that this is going on now the first episode is coming out the month i turn 16 and i genuinely feel like im growing with the characters
this this means that senior year will also eventually happen right i dont wanna get too ahead of myself but these lovable goofsrole models got me anticipating two seasons for the price of one insane hype

i grew up playing classical music and its so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamberlike setting laufey says in her performance accompanied by a string quartet the singersongwriters modern jazzpop love songs soared at the tiny desk the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact

laufeys music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger mainstream audiences coming to the genre her sophomore album bewitched broke spotifys alltime streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platforms history and resulted in her first grammy nomination she opens the set with from the start a bouncy whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend connecting chet bakerlike scats with charming and playful lyrics taking a more melancholic turn into 2021s let you break my heart again and promise her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings creating a symphony of emotions laufey concludes the set with california and me which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by liszt and chopin this mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and musics ability to evoke raw unfiltered emotion

that was unbelievable i had only ever heard the first song before i just cried my eyes out i cant remember the last time music i hadnt hear before hit me on such an emotional level such perfectly crafted songs such palpable melancholy i am overwhelmed in the best way possible
such a beautiful voice  ive listened to laufeys songs during the past few months and seeing her perfoming live at tiny desk is such a treat ive had teary eyes during promise  id love to see her live one day 
her voice scale control and timbre are just incredible she reminds me of ella in how she hits her lows new fan

etherealworkshop evolayersen",470,"flasque has become by far my new favourite monster i cant even describe how much i love him his sound is unreal
the plasma quad being a banshee is actually genius
all references of number of elements in the design
meebkin three fingers three bumps on tail  head crest three creatures meebkin itself and two meebs
gaddzooks three eyes three toes three mouths
yooreek three fingers 
blarret three mouths three nails
auglur three hands
nitebear three eyes three toes three fingers brown hand three body sections brown half blue half greenish head
flasque three sections of the head three toes three floating flasks
whaill four toes
fun fact gadzooks now has a new track the one that was teased but was never shown on the new island
was not expecting how these new monsters would sound but i do like them all a lot it is nice to see the island be extended with these additions and while there is still a long way to go i can already start to see the direction this island will take
i cant wait to hear what the rest of the song brings these new guys are all great
flasque is so satisfying to hear its like monster asmr
i love how nitebear is straight up inspired from fnaf but also keeping it original
whaill adds so much more to the song now im curious for what the full song will be like
you can already tell that this island is gonna look chaotic and sound amazing when its done
theyve changed the vibe of the song completely
im glad we got a metal clanging sound it fits the workshop vibe my only complaint is the whaill verse it sounds cool but it doesnt flow too well into the next verse
was wondering when gadzooks second track would be implemented  love the new verse  song is beautiful so far
flasque is putting in such insane work
i love how they added another track for gaddzooks and how nitebear is based on fnaf whaill looks absolutely great as well the msm developers really are putting their love into the game
i have an affinity towards mech elementals thanks to vhamp and nitebear had satisfied my cravings as a fnaf fan the other 2 are great too
damn this sounds great cant wait for future updates
i thought this island was gonna be ruined by more monsters but they definitely made it better
honestly i wish the other more stable ethereals were on the island but it is really good
i love that none of them have any kind of synergy but they do at the same time",20,Gaming,500000,PT1M46S,"['flasque become far new favourite monster cannot even describe how much love him his sound unreal', 'the plasma quad being banshee actually genius', 'all reference number element the design', 'meebkin three finger three bump tail head crest three creature meebkin itself and two meebs', 'gaddzooks three eye three toe three mouth', 'yooreek three finger', 'blarret three mouth three nail', 'auglur three hand', 'nitebear three eye three toe three finger brown hand three body section brown half blue half greenish head', 'flasque three section the head three toe three floating flask', 'whaill four toe', 'fun fact gadzooks now new track the one that teased but never shown the new island', 'not_ expecting how these new monster would sound but like them all lot nice see the island extended with these addition and while there still long way can already start see the direction this island will take', 'cannot wait hear what the rest the song brings these new guy are all great', 'flasque satisfying hear like monster asmr', 'love how nitebear straight inspired from fnaf but also keeping original', 'whaill add much more the song now curious for what the full song will like', 'you can already tell that this island going look chaotic and sound amazing when done', 'they have changed the vibe the song completely', 'glad got metal clanging sound fit the workshop vibe only complaint the whaill verse sound cool but doe not_ flow too well into the next verse', 'wondering when gadzooks second track would implemented love the new verse song beautiful far', 'flasque putting such insane work', 'love how they added another track for gaddzooks and how nitebear based fnaf whaill look absolutely great well the msm developer really are putting their love into the game', 'have affinity towards mech elementals thanks vhamp and nitebear had satisfied craving fnaf fan the other are great too', 'damn this sound great cannot wait for future update', 'thought this island going ruined more monster but they definitely made better', 'honestly wish the other more stable ethereals were the island but really good', 'love that none them have any kind synergy but they the same time']",106

as much as i do love dana i think he cares more about this jones  stipe fight than any of the fans do
and adam never stepped foot in the war room again after that role play bit 
bro just sorted out jim miller what a man
jim miller ufc 100200 and now 300 what a carrier hes had
danas face on 823  i cant cope
aspinal should only be fighting for the title at this point
that role play def went better in your head  great interview as always bro
i really want to find someone actually still interested in the jones v stipe fight even when the fight got cancelled i was infinitely more excited about the tom v pav fight 

now that we have to wait even longer for it its just going to feel more and more anticlimactic by the time the fight actually comes around 

the ufc has always moved with the times better than any other sports organisation but on this subject this is one of those rare times that i feel theyre going in the wrong direction
the fans want aspinall fighting for gold
i dont see the reasoning why jones and stipe deserve to fight eachother ahead of aspinall deserve is such a compicated word nobody deserves anything unless they earn it how has a guy whos fought once at heavyweight and another guy who lost his last fight years ago earned the right to be at the top of the pile meanwhile aspinall is fighting anyone he can get his hands on at short notice and saving cards and he gets told to wait its absolutely stinks
so freaking excited for saturday i am fully expecting covington to win but im just so pumped for the whole card cant wait to watch it
fair play to catterall he just got jim miller on the 300 card miller owes him a drink
ive never been to a ufc event and i would love nothing more than to one day go to one
aspinall vs miocic makes so much sense would be a great fight for 300
821 danas face 
get aspinall to the new co op arena in manchester next year will be the biggest arena in the uk
jim miller in ufc 300 really needs to hapoen been saying it for weeks
thats a world record in itself
who from that era can say that today

december 4th will forever be one of the best days of our lives 

an adoption is finalized when all of the necessary postplacement requirements have been met when people ask when does the adoption become final for the adopting parents in most adoptions the final adoption hearing occurs around six months after placement although some hearings can happen as little as three months or up to a year after placement

traditionally adoption finalization occurs in a courtroom although more and more judges are offering final adoption hearings over videocall or phone call your adoption specialist and adoption attorney will work together to schedule this hearing and ensure you are prepared for any questions that may be asked during this process

we love you all so much
dallin and bella

props to keith and becky for keeping their baby very private shows theyre already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them
the mystery event is 100 a 24 hour livestream of eugene sitting on keiths lap
so much respect for keith and becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality ahem that is the way to raise a child as a public figure congrats to you both
i appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to eugene the fact that hes off making his dreams come true and they dont make him pick try guys over that is amazing hes still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy 
i cant believe the return of candid competition isnt the biggest announcement thats incredible news
i consider kwesi an official try guy he fits so well hes so perfect so funny and sweet
even though the situation that caused it was awful i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible the variance of content the variance of oncamera personalities its all such a breath of fresh air theres so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now there really is something for everyone
i miss eugene but were all proud of him and excited for everything hes a part of i struggle with change but yall make it exciting
i would love to see another episode about zach talking about his chronic pain management him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot
the best thing try guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in jared kwesi johnny marissa are the best additions to the try family
okay i gotta say you guys blow my mind i first arrived here because of the event but i stayed here because i liked your personality and because i was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or dumb they are in the past year ive been learning more and more about how you manage the company how you create more content etc and wow i respect it so much and this video just confirmed it even more for me
honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the keith and zach channel and eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and zach and keith have always been my favorite try guys
ive said it before and ill say it again this channel has the most talented editors every single video looks so incredible
i really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen so happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth
i am so damn proud of them to see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years i am so damn proud
we miss eugene when hes not here but im so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them i hope it all turn out great for him 3
the way they are so candid about why theyre charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on youtube is incredible honestly i love that about them
i love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship

manchesterunited mufc",1438,"david de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade i hate how he was brushed aside
ten hag in his post match said we played well and we didnt deserve to lose
i cant believe you actually thought they would win mark  with that team  we are manchester united  yep a midtable team with horrible players and management  it will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4
but mark you have to admit that other than martinez ten hags signings have been just terrible and very expensive
the problem is that because eth rates players like onana antony mount and mctominay i dont rate him
karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like its gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
figure it out eth wanted onanahe got him  not the glazers eth accountability
what does accountability of ten hag mean if a possibility of firing him isnt on the table
manchester united are the first premier league side to finish bottom of their ucl group on two occasions also 200506  record breakers also the first english side to concede 15 goals in ucl
onana has been a revelation in goala terrible revelation that ten hag has no fkin clue cheers erik
for me its mainoo simple as thatthe kids got a needle eye for a through ball and hes brave enough to attempt it we need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him we cant be playing side to side long balls all the effin time like why is this kid not constantly starting
the biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
we pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
david is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment
ten hag is sacking himself playing mctominay keep starting onana not subbing off bruno kmt if he gets the sack he deserves it  he can blame no one but himself kmt
a lot of people dont wanna hear it but bruno ruins the team its not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much either a terrible pass or a terrible shot occasionally hell slap a beauty but most of the time hes a losing factor either way hes way too risky if you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position his attitude stinks complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in honestly he has to go and mctominay 
dont get me started on mctominay
youll blame anyone and everyone other than erik ten hag for the team he manages
as you sit and listen to mark defend eths job after this just remember mark unironically believed manchester united would win the cl this season he said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had
if you go from believing we can win the competition only to come 4th in a favourable group then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable 

eth spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at lcb as an excuse for his ego trip with varane and then tonight kept him at lcb while evans played rcb he constantly talks about standards but onana who has now led us to being the english team who has conceded the most goals in a cl group stage ever got to play every game despite costing us points the sooner this guy is gone the better

 gojo dancing clip outro httpsyoutubehxhrle7eunk",1525,"i kinda expected hakari to be overwhelming i like the idea of old sorcerers being shook when they think because they are from the golden age they cant be challenged then hakari roles up with his goofy ass technique and goes ham
sukuna is interested in the executional swordso he tune down the slash to not kill them immediately
looking at the last panel those slashes look like the normal version not the existence cutting ones sukuna just said hes interested in the executioners sword so he might toy with higuruma a bit
yuji did something with that punch i just know it it didnt seem like anything significant at the time but theres no way that those guys are surviving regular slashes when ryo was turned into pork chops
not gonna lie gege is the real sukuna
i dont think its necessarily every slash of sukuna that can now cut the worldjust the ones he choosesprobably these were his normal dismantle slashes
we didnt see maki intervening the fight our crew did calculated something wrong but i think they mustve had another backup plan
well learn that kusakabe is actually just him and his simple domain is simply built different
546 your wrong that slashes are just a weaker version than the one that killed gojo sukuna is probably just playing with them just to intereste himself since he wants to see higurumas sword
im so excited because hakari is back
when yujis granddad said to die surrounded by the people he loved he didnt specify if they had to be alive yuji could die surrounded by the corpses of everyone in jujutsu high for all we know
even if sukunas ct got confiscated he still has his cursed tools damn he comes prepared
bold speculation suggeting all of sukunas attacks will only ever be the upgraded slashes and not something he toggles when he wants to use them
god this one seriously takes me off guard i really cant imagine what will happen because i can find no reason to our crew to not being cut in half just sukunas mood
hope they find a way cus i like so much all of the ones in the battlefield right now
no he is absolutely just going easy on the slashes he could 100 just do that massive world cutting slash and end them all but he doesnt he wants to fight since all the strongest sorcerers in the world are gathered in one place to fight him
maan gege aint conceding anything regarding sukuna lol every theory i had on how the fight will go depended on sukuna losing shrine add the kenjaku shenanigans plus this and i can safely say i have no idea how any of this will go down
with all that being said hakari is a beast and uraume better show us something
good luck on your college exams my guy thanks for the awesome video and leaks
im really hyped for the next chapter
i think the reason gege decided to take away the ct of the tool over the slashes was because of yuji yuji was stated to be a curse object soaked in sukunas curse energy since we already saw how purple did less damage to gojo because it was his own attack we can assume the same for slashes to yuji if he would have taken the slashes then yuji could have gotten one shotted by the curse tool made by a thousand binding vows
seeing a glimpse of the hakari fight was everything that boy built differenttttttt def looking forward to seeing what uraume does theres a reason why theyre so close to sukuna and we will see why soon",24,Entertainment,64900,PT8M3S,"['kind expected hakari overwhelming like the idea old sorcerer being shook when they think because they are from the golden age they cannot challenged then hakari role with his goofy technique and ham', 'sukuna interested the executional swordso tune down the slash not_ kill them immediately', 'looking the last panel those slash look like the normal version not_ the existence cutting one sukuna just said interested the executioner sword might toy with higuruma bit', 'yuji did something with that punch just know did not_ seem like anything significant the time but there way that those guy are surviving regular slash when ryo turned into pork chop', 'not_ going lie gege the real sukuna', 'not_ think necessarily every slash sukuna that can now cut the worldjust the one choosesprobably these were his normal dismantle slash', 'did not_ see maki intervening the fight our crew did calculated something wrong but think they must have had another backup plan', 'well learn that kusakabe actually just him and his simple domain simply built different', '546 your wrong that slash are just weaker version than the one that killed gojo sukuna probably just playing with them just intereste himself since want see higurumas sword', 'excited because hakari back', 'when yujis granddad said die surrounded the people loved did not_ specify they had alive yuji could die surrounded the corps everyone jujutsu high for all know', 'even sukunas got confiscated still his cursed tool damn come prepared', 'bold speculation suggeting all sukunas attack will only ever the upgraded slash and not_ something toggle when want use them', 'god this one seriously take off guard really cannot imagine what will happen because can find reason our crew not_ being cut half just sukunas mood', 'hope they find way like much all the one the battlefield right now', 'absolutely just going easy the slash could 100 just that massive world cutting slash and end them all but doe not_ want fight since all the strongest sorcerer the world are gathered one place fight him', 'maan gege are not_ conceding anything regarding sukuna lol every theory had how the fight will depended sukuna losing shrine add the kenjaku shenanigan plus this and can safely say have idea how any this will down', 'with all that being said hakari beast and uraume better show something', 'good luck your college exam guy thanks for the awesome video and leak', 'really hyped for the next chapter', 'think the reason gege decided take away the the tool over the slash because yuji yuji stated curse object soaked sukunas curse energy since already saw how purple did damage gojo because his own attack can assume the same for slash yuji would have taken the slash then yuji could have gotten one shotted the curse tool made thousand binding vow', 'seeing glimpse the hakari fight everything that boy built differenttttttt def looking forward seeing what uraume doe there reason why they are close sukuna and will see why soon']",483

drumeo nandibushell twistedsister",1839,"thank you so much drumeo for inviting me on i had the best time
aj pero was a criminally underrated drummer  lots of people are unaware at how good he really was
a great fresh version of a classic

her innocence when she says  i like how they all dressed up for the video
keep rocking nandi great work 
if you want to try this and many other drumless songs get a 7day free trial to check out drumeo  httpwwwdrumeocomtrial
shes 1000x better at this age then ill ever be in my life  so much talent and work
absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer its truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age i can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums the precision timing and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable a true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself
she effin killed it  her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing  i was super impressed  im not as surprised now to see how foo fighters identified her skill so long ago  this was incredible  no offense to twisted sister but i think she really turned it up to 11
that was phenomenal you can see how nandis taken all of the lessons from chad smith and dave grohl to heart so happy to hear her keeping rock alive id say her drums worked better in places than the original track she had more fills and had some double kick in places one of the best in this series
this was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 
her talent just shines in this video  what a great take on that song
her approach brings such a late 90searly 00s poppunk vibe to the whole song if that version were released in that era it still would have been a hit
what i love about nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is you can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that
i love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hihat that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when its metal
she is so impressive with not only how she plays which is outstanding but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly
aj is smiling down at this best series hands down shes so effin talented 
nandi is so awesome what an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid this was pure joy
i gotta saythis was amazing nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before wow wow wow 
im so psyched to see nandi on here  love her drumming love her energy this is an amazing performance  so many little things match up with her version and the original  cant wait to see more of nandi here  i know the guys of twisted sister will love this
nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with dave grohl im very impressed shes got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that dont overwhelm the overall song great work from her and i think once her gcses and a levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one

pokemon legendarypokemon infinitefusion",532,"pokemon fusions are one thing but the fact things like deoxys and regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
the only thing i regret is not fusing more legendaries with magikarp
i actually like this twist to a fusions playthrough because we get to see the coolerrarer fusions
no chance john wins that champion battle without tyler he really saved the day
the miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now tysm john and tyler for putting this in
i love that john still names his requazas gregory after that epic jmc episode in season 1 
i also love how john plays this game we all know legends are the most fun to fuse xd
935 loving the ben 10 reference with this one been rewatching it this week for the first time since i was a kid and just finished my first ever infinite fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a chronosapienclockwork reference in this fangame i hope you do more videos on it
pm7 providing top notch quality videos right when im about to eat lunch lovely
i love all the screams tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
how can you follow up giratina square
lance another one
roger is one of my favourite fusions ive seen across all infinite fusion content love the videos john
that raikouhydreigon is so sick that could definitely be a boss battle in dark souls or something
ive always wanted to play infinite fusion but just have never found the time its nice to see someone exploring all the fun legendary fusions
i cant believe it he actually evolved feesh raydos might look awesome but itll never recapture the image of rayeesh
i seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 
lets go clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurkdialga fusion
2531 that just about killed me
its never too late to do a playthough of a game ive seen lots of infinite fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it really looking forward to the next part
also i think the catch rate might be higher in this game or fluctuate depending on the fusion but i was still left in suspense at all the captures
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level so you dont see slugmas and pichus in the elite 4
super happy youre planning to do another video on this game im a spriter for the game and id love to see you use some of my legendary fusions they wont be in the game until january though due to the update schedule for sprites",20,Gaming,819000,PT35M47S,"['pokemon fusion are one thing but the fact thing like deoxys and regigigas and just chillin foot outside town should really worrying the local', 'the only thing regret not_ fusing more legendaries with magikarp', 'actually like this twist fusion playthrough because get see the coolerrarer fusion', 'chance john win that champion battle without tyler really saved the day', 'the miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro ingraved memory now tysm john and tyler for putting this', 'love that john still name his requazas gregory after that epic jmc episode season', 'also love how john play this game all know legend are the most fun fuse', '935 loving the ben reference with this one been rewatching this week for the first time since kid and just finished first ever infinite fusion playthrough really fitting see chronosapienclockwork reference this fangame hope you more video', 'pm7 providing top notch quality video right when about eat lunch lovely', 'love all the scream tyler put when reveals the fusion had the floor', 'how can you follow giratina square', 'lance another one', 'roger one favourite fusion have seen across all infinite fusion content love the video john', 'that raikouhydreigon sick that could definitely bos battle dark soul something', 'have always wanted play infinite fusion but just have never found the time nice see someone exploring all the fun legendary fusion', 'cannot believe actually evolved feesh raydos might look awesome but will never recapture the image rayeesh', 'seemed always miss the wheel spin and just kept getting surprised the current round fusion', 'let clockwork perfect inspiration for that golurkdialga fusion', '2531 that just about killed', 'never too late playthough game have seen lot infinite fusion playthroughs and this fun take really looking forward the next part', 'also think the catch rate might higher this game fluctuate depending the fusion but still left suspense all the capture', 'the only issue have with these kind randomizers that becomes too easy the end but most randomizers have seetting make use fully evolved only after certain level you not_ see slugmas and pichus the elite', 'super happy you are planning another video this game spriter for the game and love see you use some legendary fusion they will not_ the game until january though due the update schedule for sprite']",2147

ufc",2367,"the fact that wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
always rooting for wonderboy hes a great role model love seeing him teach the kids karate
if the ufc made a show about wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome id never miss an episode
thompson is unreal he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
this was one of the most positive and happy embedded ive seen happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week theyll need it for the presser
such a heartwarming embedded even someone im not a fan of like paddy hes a good dude at heart good to see
im proud of wonderboys facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight but ensuring that they get their homework done
wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act its honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
123 i respect wonderboy so much he knows to his core all his skills took time years  years of honing what hes teaching these children  by simply picking them up from school a world class fighter you have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds we all got in this art from watching movies i cant imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training
since everyone is talking about how great wonderboy is 

right after the luque fight i ran into him at disneyland i was a single rider on the smugglers run ride and ended up with him and his family i was so stoked i told him my wife cant ride because she is with my 2 year old son and he said well youre part of our family for this ride now

after the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son he was seriously the nicest guy id ever met it was something ill never forget
wonderboy really is that dude great human being
why cant wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years hes one of the nicest guys on the planet and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
the fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing ive ever seen
we need more fighters like wonderboy in gyms everywhere a good man is hard to find
brandon royval and stephen thompson seem like genuinely good guysrole models really nice to see that
paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell hes a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan 
im rooting for royval and edwards 
but it aint going to be easy 
what a great card to end the year
paddys honestly a great dude fighter or not the guys got my admiration
i know ufc doesnt wanna take the focus away from their fight night cards but you really should build up these big ppv events for more than just a week hype usually takes a bit of time to build properly

the fact blue think he doesnt rap off beat is crazy and the fact he thinks we can really name 3 of his songs is even more crazy
marco is very tactical not your average comedian interviewer influencer nothing lol
if you watch this with no sort of bias against blueface he and marco are truly just hilarious idiots
it never fails every time marco gives you a compliment he follows it with a diss  i think you smart and can do a lot of things so why cant you rap on beat
he done took them sunglasses onnand off fifty million times 
marcos face when blueface said ive never had that hairstyle 
their personalities mix very well i was weak the whole time 
that man said  name 3 bluface songs rn he really responded with or i die 
let me roll up this shit gon be hilarious
the crumpled 100 when blueface was talking having to fight 4 ppl was a great touch 
two statements i took to be genuinely useful

you dont have to be good at anything you just have to be good at trying

fyi there is also passive income if you buy the tow truck and the wall safe upgrade so keep in mind avoid the staff upgrade unless you have spare money so keep in mind should work like the one in the auto shop this comment is for beginners only
i got my eyes on the new mustang finally a proper modern mustang
just done the cayo perico start to finish exactly the same way taco does it and i only noticed one small change 
it the intel gather mission when you steal the plane to fly to the island the driver side door is no longer stuck open this is excellent for my ocd 
i regret choosing the most expensive location hard to get into shop gang attack could spawn and cars dont always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the moc to have the leds from the christmas truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 here is your weekly update video including all of the things added in the winter dlc chop shop what do you think of this new dlc so far more vids coming throughout the day
prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane
the range rover was on my very short list along with the escalade v and that 96 impala ss was an amazing surprise but im still hurt about no new   dubsta aka g5563 its got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community the turismo and the chop shop are the only things ill have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me
the new grotti drives so damn nice liking the new declasse impaler lx but i just love them type of muscle cars anyway the vigero zx and dominator are pretty cool but i still prefer the roof up best feature so far the garage organizer
the vehicle prices are crazy  i wish it was more like real life
tuner update and chop shop are my fav so far love the low grips and manual stick
so far so good this is a solid dlc its a w from me still would have liked to have a heist with this dlc as well but its all good
top tier i appreciate the time and effort put into the vids

the car selection for this update is quite nice loving the infiniti and the camry
another change that i noticed on ps is when you fire the avenger turrets it changes to a different turret they made it the same button
well i actually like the interaction menu updates there are less items in each category now makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier will this change speed runs
im probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle but im hyped that we can get the cluckin bell van and omg the baller std only rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
done my first complete salvage mission start to finish took almost 2 hours without knowing what the heck i was doing mind and made gta350000 from it

what a player
really happy forjoselu
union were in every ucl match this season unfortunately they gave up late goals in many of them
im a rm fan but how is joselus first goal allowed he literally had his whole arm around the player
how did rm find joselu bro is just like benz perfect striker
i think ronnow has proved hes too good for this struggling union berlin team
have no idea why still using full team instead of youngsters for this match
that was a foul on the defender for madrids first
dani ceballos i feel bad for him he scores the winning goal at almost 90th minute and his mates are barely celebrating with him he needs time to fit in the new squad

one of my favorite foods of all times a bodega jamaican beef patty is pure comfort but knowing the home version is made by the hands of a new yorker i feel this is very well validated
let me tell you as someone from the carribean who eats patties regularly i was actually kinda gitty that it appeared in such a great big movie also even tho i am not jamaican its still the best patties especially the crispy flaky ones 
jamaican patties are also quite common here in costa rica we costa ricans call them pat here and we make them with either ground beef or chicken 

we also add it hot pepper and definitely our patties do not have cheese especially that american cheese that is not even real cheese
its definitely great to see babish handle a true jamaican delicacy
i found that dipping cheesy beef patties in oxtail gravy is out of this world
ive had a jamaican patty made with a nice tender ground lamb absolutely wonderful
when i was kid in harlem some pizza parlors would also put pepperoni and mozzarella inside upon request  also as the years go by ive been more of a chicken patty guy 
one of my favorite things to do with the store bought beef patties is to carefully split them open after cooking and add some irish cheddar i know you can buy them with beef and cheese filling but you cant buy them with my favorite cheese
this is the first bwb episode ive watched since the interview he did on mythical kitchen and i burst into tears when i heard him do the intro
im not caribbean in any way shape or form but spicy beef patties are one of my favorite foods ever can eat them all day every day
as a jamaican and growing up with these things i am so happy to see it catch on in america beef patties are everything crunchy soft creamy spicy its nice seeing the love
i used to get so excited when they served these for lunch in elementary school the lunch ladies were so nice because they would give me two knowing i would only eat the inside 
you are right finding the suet is way harder then locating premade beef patties  it is totally worth the effort though fresh made beef patties are amazing
i love everything that is coming out of the babish universe but the nostalgia i feel when you make a classic video like this 3 cant be beat thanks for sharing 
i had never had these until they caught my eye at the grocery store the other day in the frozen section and now i cant stop my only question is what would happen if you deep fried them
as a jamaican i feel so recognized thanks andrew
you did this justice i grew up eating beef patties at my dads deli all the time and its still to this day my guilty pleasure they look great
seeing the one food from my familys island home has lighten me up as someone whose family is literally from the island of jamaica this made me extremely excited thank you babish 3

what a player the defense of bayern was really good today
i wish mane worked at bayern so they would have a front 3 of sane kane mane
kim min jae is world class what a performance 
davies is like the gordan murray t50 car
ten hag might be the first manager to win motm and a month later getting sacked
congrats man u for making the top 4 
badly missed old those days with sir alex ferguson man utd had a terrible performance not being able to complete even 10 passes so disappointing to see how man utd performing poorly in the field as a lifelong man utd fan i must admit that i suffer from poor management and lack of responsibility from the club executives
you gotta feel for ten hag their shape looked better after halftime instruction only for them to fall back into disorganization and being pushed wide and pressed again 
seems to me like man u strangles the creativity right out of players to coach with a club culture like that must be tough 
that being said bayern looks like a strong team again
this is football heritage  jose mourinho
ronaldo must be loving every minute of this highlight  especially when the cameras focus on management 
since 1980 i ve never seen a goalkeeper that stay at his line on one on one its like an invitation to the other player to score 
kaneworld class bravo
onana moving backwards on a 1on1 loool
anthony one of the most useless signing in man utds history
549 sane left side already knew coman would score haha
did anything happen in this game champions league group stage matches are so often mismatches with bayern playing against these small teams at the bottom of the cl standings
bayern will have a loophole if they lose davies  they better extend his contract
mans is built different 
goretzka should be congratulated for bayerns victory  if you look at the replay  it was the hard work of goretzka to keep control of the ball while under pressure from man u defense and make a good pass which resulted in the excellent pass by kane to coman for the winning goal

clashofclans coc th16 townhall16 clashon hammerjam foryou foryoupage fyp gaming update heroequipment spiritfox rootrider",2683,"lets go love that players from th8 and above have access to the equipment it certainly will be one of the most epic ever great job
i seen very few games that i never get bored of truly a master piece thanks a lot supercell
adding hero equipment is such a good idea im glad the devs found a way to make attacking more interesting and interactive without having to make it too complex
just saw the patch notes they changed the power potion effect from laboratory level to townhall level this means you dont have to make lab your priority after upgrading to a newer townhall 
loved everything so far but maybe a alternative th defense would be better next time rather than the 4th remake of gigainferno
wish we could still have the stat progress bars so you could see how the new equipment progresses with each upgrade relative to the maxed stats
i really love the update specially the nature sheme it looks so awesome but i it wouldve be alot better if the townhall would do a massive earthquake when troops comes near it than this lame inferno weapon but yeah thats my opinion
to give a significant role to the walls now they could start doing damage to troops since they have fire pikes or eletricity
im glad the hero abilities stayed at the right level good job supercell greatest update ive been present for
edit i do wish the blacksmith was elixir to upgrade instead of gold
i love how its straight to the point
i like when they add both new content for max players and some stuff for us midtownhall players too
been saying hero skins need to come with varying abilities for years now glad they finally made a way to have heros adjustable
what i think is that we were getting a free upgrade on our hero abilities by upgrading our heroes but now we have to extra grind for them separately 
the new troop is absolutely devastating it really opens up the base
part of coc since a decade 
lots of love waiting for update as quick as possible 
one of the biggest updates ever never bored clashing way to go team 
the giant arrow is so fun

its hitbox might be a bit big though it hits stuff that it doesnt even come close to visually touching a 05 tile radius would be more fitting to the visual and might help temper its power a bit
loved it wow such a upgraded version we awaiting  amazing 
respect for game developers
i love the hero equipment as long as they dont make it pay to win its gonna be so much fun it also allows for more build crafting for players which is so fun and makes attacks unique",20,Gaming,20100000,PT3M14S,"['let love that player from th8 and above have access the equipment certainly will one the most epic ever great job', 'seen very few game that never get bored truly master piece thanks lot supercell', 'adding hero equipment such good idea glad the devs found way make attacking more interesting and interactive without having make too complex', 'just saw the patch note they changed the power potion effect from laboratory level townhall level this mean you not_ have make lab your priority after upgrading newer townhall', 'loved everything far but maybe alternative defense would better next time rather than the 4th remake gigainferno', 'wish could still have the stat progress bar you could see how the new equipment progress with each upgrade relative the maxed stats', 'really love the update specially the nature sheme look awesome but would have alot better the townhall would massive earthquake when troop come near than this lame inferno weapon but yeah that opinion', 'give significant role the wall now they could start doing damage troop since they have fire pike eletricity', 'glad the hero ability stayed the right level good job supercell greatest update have been present for', 'edit wish the blacksmith elixir upgrade instead gold', 'love how straight the point', 'like when they add both new content for max player and some stuff for midtownhall player too', 'been saying hero skin need come with varying ability for year now glad they finally made way have hero adjustable', 'what think that were getting free upgrade our hero ability upgrading our hero but now have extra grind for them separately', 'the new troop absolutely devastating really open the base', 'part coc since decade', 'lot love waiting for update quick possible', 'one the biggest update ever never bored clashing way team', 'the giant arrow fun', '', 'hitbox might bit big though hit stuff that doe not_ even come close visually touching tile radius would more fitting the visual and might help temper power bit', 'loved wow such upgraded version awaiting amazing', 'respect for game developer', 'love the hero equipment long they not_ make pay win going much fun also allows for more build crafting for player which fun and make attack unique']",194

x httpstwittercomkensingtonroyal",2321,"those children are so well behaved and polite a credit to their parents they get stuck in and catherine explains what its for and why its important it looks like they brought donations from home too how worthwhile
im an american and i must say the wales family are a breath of fresh air
i really love how george and charlotte and louis work together to help their mother pack and carry things its very rare for me to see something like this and the first time i saw this video i feel extraordinary closeness and warmth in the welsh family  thanks for sharing this video
if all parents took their time to educate their children like this we would have a better world
this is really a great initiative we would like also to inform everyone that we collected thousands of 9o off codes for this month make sure to get some
this is so wonderful catherine teaching her children at a young age to give back i love that they took boxes out of their car to give as well
catherine is a great teacher to her childrensimple as that  just having them aware of other human beings like themselves
this is such a wonderful caring video  princess catherine bringing her children to volunteer helping with the huge job of sorting of dividing the donations for families in need  not only have they learned the positive lesson of volunteering but more importantly they are learning about the thousands of children and families who are struggling and will be so happy to receive this loving outpouring of support from their communities during the holidays the wales children are caring and loving just like their wonderful parents  
got very emotional watching how down to earth the wales family are catherine princess of wales emits beauty from within
the interactions between herself the children and the people surrounding her 
is genuine and regal 
the children are so naturally well behaved may god bless them the wales family is built on solid foundations and stability
how can you not love this family kudos to the prince and princess of wales for raising well adjusted children they are doing an amazing job
love how  george wants to come back yes momma train them to serve and care about others
the fact that the children behave so well and so politely is all due to their parents
great mother great wife and great future queen of the uk princess catherine works hard to carve out her own roles and create her own style of doing things it is never look at me aint i a great humanitarian we can see her humility dedication steadfastness of purpose and tremendous hard work thank you catherine we are lucky to have you and your family
what a wonderful mother teaching her children the value of giving back to others and recognizing those in need there is not a greater gift than compassion for others and while i am sure catherine and william teach many private lessons on selflessness at home it is good to see george charlotte and louis in action no doubt these children will live lives of service and respect for all
the wales children are absolutely wonderful  so are their parents
catherine is an amazing mum educating her children to show respect and compassion for others who have far less than they do  the royal children do it so carefully and considerately they are an inspiration 
so wholesome a great example for everyone
it is so good to see catherine the princess of wales taking her children and teaching them to serve i got my kids to plan and prepare a meal to give to one a family having a new baby when they learn to serve when they are young the children grow to be empathic and compassionate and to look around outside themselves it is so good to see such an excellent example of guiding her children and being a leader for the world

what a simple message  to get out there and help in any way  it is good to see the future royals learning how to help  in the us we have a few organizations one is toy for tots  police depts  fire depts all get involved as do individuals to help out    there are many other organizations too  for single parents for runaway teens for the animals and those in hospitals  so many ways to get involved

i am really glad that colby decided to say his fear out loud because ive been struggling with the same one for the last few years its nice to know someone out there is also feeling uneasy because of this makes me feel less alone
honestly colby is so real for having that fear its definitely one you dont really think about but most of us probably have
wildlife biologist here that hissing in the shack sounded like an opossum to me  other animals like marmots will hiss like that a gutteral hiss not the silkiness of a snake hiss it was probably looking for bugs or rodents and upset you disturbed its hunt 
imagine being a ghost and seeing the bathtub full of water and getting all excited to take yourself a little ghostly soak so you turn the jets on and suddenly everyone freaks out

these guys really push the limit of whats possible
so happy to see youtube sponsoring this video you definitely deserve it so proud of how far youve come hope you take the time to appreciate what youve built now and then
i bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign and its absolutely amazing i used it for a few hours on the 4th of july and had no issues i didnt even have to refill it
oh my sweet celestia i love the logo design with aperture science

and id say its accurate because you guys are the embodiment of science is about why not

also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
fun personal experience for about a year i worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with class 10 clean rooms no perfume cologne makeup or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there and no skin exposed everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed and goggles that even had small air filters in them

james ive gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode this episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that ive been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today i sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team def bought a minisabre too
not a starwars fan more of a pirates of the caribbean guy but i loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic its an amazing project with an amazing team
i know no one will see this but i just want to say how amazing you guys are from your garage to the herc facility ive watched every video ive forgotten how long or at what amount of people i subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago but i want to thank you guys for everything youre doing pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers chemists physicists and rocket scientists keep up the amazing work cant wait for the we amputated this guys limbs and turned him into darth vader video but seriously you guys are awesome
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists been watching for a very long time around 4 years goodluck hacksmith
i am curious as to how theyll manage sabers clashing its been long theorizedand more or less confirmed in rebels that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact maybe theyll be able to utilize something to that regard
i love how casually he said lets play with liquid oxygen immediately after telling us how dangerous it is exactly what id expect from a sciengineeringinfotainment channel
how far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
while watched you earlier you were just making marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
now  the hacksmith is like an industry
too happy for you my man
keep going
hacksmith is doing something that even large companies wouldnt do big respect
the team at hacksmith industries actually do things that most people dont even think of its crazy 
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational maybe youre less stressed now or something but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends
i truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility you can see engineering past present and future in your labs

oh man the hotel analogy is too true all the new luxury apartments in la have these tiny units with windows on only one side going for 5000mo rent and when you open your front door instead of being outside youre in a depressingly artificially lit hallway each time i left a tour of a new apartment i thought to myself i want to live somewhere that feels like a home not somewhere that feels like a hotel  and certainly not for 5000mo now i understand why i always had that feeling
given that switzerland has the lowest fire deaths per capita and no limit on the height of single stair buildings i am totally comfortable doing away with the rule altogether
ive watched a lot of apartment videos never too small apartment therapy house  home etc and in a million years i never would have guessed that the apartment at 1007 was in seattle my first thought would have been somewhere in europe or latin america 

ive gotten so used to seeing a certain layout in modern buildings in north america and i didnt realise it was windowstaircase related until now this video was such a fresh take and its so interesting to see certain cities taking a different approach thanks for doing what youre doing
living in a chicago walkup and most buildings on my block being the same roughly 34 stories this staircase issue seems to be somewhat alleviated by having outdoor staircases attached at the back on the building this being said almost all chicago blocks have alleyways in addition to the street so access is easier than other cities added bonus each unit in my building has a small outdoor space on the staircase landing where people set up small bistro sets grills and outdoor furniture in a mini patio setup not ideal but my building was built in the 90s so compatible with the current building codes
its funny because a german youtube channel just did a video on why german cities are so ugly and some arent it was because after the second world war there were some that rebuilt as it used to be while others built for the car nowadays the cities that built for the car are wide open spaces with some boxy buildings lots of concrete that have to adhere to strict laws that govern everything but looks older cities are more humansized with lit ped zones and people are around which gives a sense of security
there was one more thing not mentioned in the video firefighters in europe have cars with ladders to evacuate people even in smaller towns those ladders reach about 30 metres which is enough which is enough for 8 floors and apartments are built so that each apartment is a separate fire compartment and the fire doesnt spread to and from the apartment
its telling that even australia has looser single stair rules than north america when they are so similar in sprawl and development to canada and to a lesser extent the usa
good stuff canada and vancouver especially way over regulated and are full of silly rules that limit development and make building more time consuming and more expensive keep making this kind of content
wow ive been wondering why every single apartment building going up in my city has at most 2 bedroom apartments and why theyre all the size of an entire city block with a hotel layout i love older style row houses i never understood why they arent being built anymore

as you mentioned because its so hard to get enough land together to bother building a modern apartment building my city is always pushing developers to go at least 810 stories or more if youre going to bother acquiring the land may as well build as much as possible because that building is going to be there for 50100 years i understand the logic but id rather see a ton of 4 story row houses that only require 005 acres of land
in belgium apartment buildings also require two separate fire escapes but one of them can be a window ladder access is required unless a fire truck can easily reach it this explains why the twostairs rule starts at 6 floors thats simply the highest our biggest ladder trucks can reach
the fire department always checks building plans before they get planning permission and local governments will basically always follow their advice so depending on the place there can be stricter limits buildings with a higher fire risk like student dorms for example always have stricter fire regulations
man these are great videos i really hope some people with power see these and start making better decisions and policies and become willing to take calculated risks rather than follow the status quo that most of them unfortunately do youre doing everyone in the aec industry and the general public a tremendous service
it is possible to design a small apartment building with two staircases one in front and one in the back i lived in apartments in both st louis and madison with them a college friend who moved to chicago also lived in one ive also rented couple apartments that had the front staircase inside and the back outside i admit its uncommon but its not impossible all these buildings were prewwii though the problem is greedy developers not apartment design
as an architect in vancouver i can confirm stairs are not the limiting factor the cost of construction is so expensive that developers cant make money off smaller buildings thats why they build larger condo buildings so their percentage of sellable area is higher
this is such an interesting video ive never heard of this i wonder if this will be discussed more as housing continues to climb and i wonder if theres any implications with birthrate if no one can find multibedroom apartments thats a major pressure on families
part of the reason we built our cities with wood housing is because when we were building our modern cities we still had a lot of timber we could use where many european countires had already used a lot of their woodlands also brick and stone dont do great in many of our more seismically active areas
i was sceptical to if its really all about the staircases but you have me convinced i never thought about how much a hallway ruins a building
excellent content and thanks for illuminating these issues so that hopefully it can spark discussion on how to more effectively deal with our housing crisis
i grew up in a sort of archology here in canada where every apartment had two floors with entrances on both floors it was a 4 storey building in some spots and sometimes the twisting hallways led to doors that you would think are doors to more tunnelsexitspool areasgarages but it led into a persons upstair hallway by accident  we could go thru tunnels between the 3 buildings so in winter we could go swimming without ever going outside it was amazing
i would also like to note that the reason why greece and finland have the highest fire deaths per capita as shown in the chart is namely because greece and finland are heavily forested countries with greece having multiple forest fires in a summer nothing to do with housing and also because wood is used often in rural finnish structures but they are always single story",22,People &

lyrics
i told you id rise up
 
youd be mistaken if you thought i was gone
cause ive been waiting for this moment too long whoa
just to see the worry in your eyes
 
i bet you thought that i had fallen away
it never crossed your mind that thered be a day whoa
id return to look you in the eyes
 
dont pray for me you said theres no hope in forgiving
your happy to just leave me for the dead
well time has passed im very much the living
and all thats left is to leave you seeing red 
 
so when you think youve got me by a thread
you need think again
cause i know you never thought that this would be how it ends
i told you id rise up
 
i dont believe that you have got any soul
youre just a breed of your own kind all alone whoa
an architect of your own decline
 
nothings sacred anymore thats the past
its falling further even more out of grasp whoa
youre replaced and running out of time
 
no prayers from me you see im not the one you think will
just let it go and leave it all behind
youre dead to me and i dont even feel guilt
just take a look cause its time for me to rise

this is such a good asmr video she seems so natural at it got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough

 gaming lego fortnite",583,"extra tip carry 6 planks with you always you can 1 craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools including the grappler which makes it actually useful or 2 craft a bed once you get to the right town level which as already stated is good for respawns alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you
hiya guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold

regarding tip 12 with the grappler
thank you everyone for the comments i wasnt aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 
it may get patched soon though

really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code rugg in the item shop
thank you all so much for the support 
more lego fortnite videos will be coming later this week
major tips read this
something to keep in mind if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest it resets the grappler back to 10 uses it makes the grappler very work getting

another tip if you take the barrels of tnt found near old broken down buildings  and throw them into clusters of trees or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while im only at 3rd village lvl great video as always
for heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
if you keep a hearty charm on it can negate low temp or high temp damage you remain at full hp you get the temp hearts so long as your at the first layer of hotcold the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10 it usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used i also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return edit just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up
suggestion i explored my map a bit with nothing on me whenever i came across something interesting i would pick up small stones nearby make a marker and place it there that way i could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything then whenever im ready id gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that i can immediately go to
great tip with the grappler you dont have to break the chest put it in and take it out unfortunately not the same for tools
as of now when it comes to dying of starvation heat or cold there is a way to negate all of them with one item it allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though i took fire damage the entire time there is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if youre already full health and it regenerates itself very quickly meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation heat or cold itll regenerate it self this allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game especially in regards to those desert caves
more tips 1 instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools just craft a traditional counter under counters as it only costs 8 wood 

2 the grapplers uses can be refreshed just like your tools except its even easier you dont even need to break whatever chestcounter youve built just throw it in a storage thing take it out and its refreshed
thanks for the great tips

my tip is for people starting a new server in survival set up a different server with the same seed in sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town
i actually would suggest making a grappler it got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit 751
i dont know if anyone said this yet but you dont actually need cool headed charms for the desert if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you dont lose your temporary hearts and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back
you can find sand shells at the beachtropical coast areas access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations
craft the grappler it only sucks because it has 10 uses but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as theres so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect
heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers assign them to threading if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
i would say its for sure worth making the grappler just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land you can do the durability glitch w the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when youre fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
fun fact you can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out  aim at the highest point of a tree and itll work perfectly with the glider",20,Gaming,287000,PT9M16S,"['extra tip carry plank with you always you can craft chest anywhere repair all your tool including the grappler which make actually useful craft bed once you get the

thedaybefore scam fntastic",1922,"the drama around this game was millions of times more entertaining than the game itself im almost sad its over seriously this is more like a crypto rug pull than a studio closure
this was a total social experiment and in some ways quite hilarious to prove a point that people will buy trash and be happy
the fact that hundreds of thousands of players actually bought such an obvious scam is the saddest part expect a lot more similar scams coming soon
most brain dead defenders of this game are like its not a scam you got a product  yes when i buy chevy camero and they give me a ford festiva im like well they did give me a product
these trash and overhyped companies need to face multimillion dollar lawsuits for false advertising
i get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games 
it honestly feels like everywhere i look there is a scam
this game was an ai generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
four days wow
that has to be some kind of record they didnt even try to hide it thats how confident they were that they could get away with it and they pretty much have
four days unbelievable
this is so blatantly a scam that im actually curious if this would qualify as criminal
like we all know that at least in america false advertising will never actually be prosecuted but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme also who wants to bet that those server issues at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund
as i said in other threads they met their contractual agreement to release a game they send their volunteers a boilerplate thank you email pay their investors and whatever is left theyll pocket without legal ramifications cant get money from a stone so by closing up shop theyre effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investorscreditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have 

they used the hype of tdb to generate a trickle of income through prop night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates

at this point steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue 

they pretty much have to at this point
its been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip  folks are claiming it was built using the 300 american city packs bundle which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95 of the ingame world would suggest is accurate its also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the 65 survival game kit v2 which is where the ingame inventory mechanics all come from
modern game made for modern gamers you all deserve each other

this was so obvious from day 1 too bad people still gave them money
watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly i cant fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming which is that i almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the actual product is instead of the dressedup version seen in trailers and marketing
personally i think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry these kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing
it would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release

special thanks to bigfrytv for his gameplay
hollyrexs clip httpswwwtwitchtvhollyrexclipbombastichyperalmonditsboshytimeyk9mhvw17bk6cm",2684,"steam has taken the game down  you can no longer buy it  apparently steam also holds money for 30 days  theyre also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played  so it looks like the developers jumped ship too early
luckily steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark this was too much of a scam even for steam
players and valve should put these guys in court
one thing i have learned over the years is there are people defending it means absolutely nothing in the world of video games    they love abuse
what people have to learn
never believe trailers 
never preoder anything
wait till the game is fully released
this is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on or rather orchastrated this game so people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
not to mention fntastic used volunteers in their development process they asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received participation certificates and free codes for the game every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it
the fact that the studio literally said shit happens is wow
level i gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isnt that easy
seconds later
also level random guy on reddit is recreating the game by himself  
i remember watching you when i was in middle school and you made airsoft videos im happy to see youre still at it man keep up the hard work 
imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be
keep an eye on the ranchers it was announced at tga a year ago and is going down the same route  even after a successful kickstarter
i have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens regardless of whether or not fntastic is actually in the red or not other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity expect to see people learning from the errors made by fntastic and performing scams better keep an eye out everyone do not buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear be cautious and stay safe and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
the frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam this was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release yet they bought it anyway its pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time
my biggest issue is i was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self but every video and trailer i watched i kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it but the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
i always follow the rule of if it looks and sounds too good to be true it probably is especially when they never show real in game footage
the gaming community should keep an eye on these people apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to eight points i feel theyll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
been appreciating your efforts since bf3  thank you for what you do
imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody i bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year thats making the game actually playable and improving on things too

filming channel httpswwwyoutubecomuserthatmumbojumbo2
instagram httpswwwinstagramcomofficialmumbo
twitter httpstwittercomthatmumbojumbo",1772,"as another comment pointed out you now need to have scar and grian try to watch this and build their own giant walking machines
mumbo you should make a machine that retracts fence posts
just in case youre being chased down by a warden 
i like mumbos concept of a basic loop and a jumbled loop however instead of jumbled loop i think it should be called a jumbo loop
if it is soo simple get grian and scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
it is kinda funny to see how closely mumbos three design rules parallel the design principles im learning as an engineering undergrad
ive never really gotten that into redstone so im genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along flying machines always mystified me but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes so much sense kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it
i love when we get mumbo videos like these  feels like the balance between theory and tutorial that makes it really easy for me personally to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards it doesnt ruin the magic of how you make them far from it it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand how cool your stuff is
yknow for tight timing things like this i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod  or recording in the 120 snapshots
that way youd have access to tick freeze and tick step which would make these explanations even better imo
this was actually really informative ive built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots thank you mumbo 
ps cool armadillo i love the eyebrows
you should use the new 1203 tick rate  tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video would probably help alot
what you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together when you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique a person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning and cool looking final product
the fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
reminds me of clockwork certainly gears are simple at their core but when combining them in large geartrains the complexity increases a lot of it is down to timing speed and torque 

fascinating
from now on every time mumbo states that something is simple we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement
ive only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle and ive already learned so much about these flying machines thank you so much mumbo
great video as always not sure if youve had a look at all the new snapshot features yet besides the crafting bench but the variable tick speed is really useful for showingseeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly
the carpet mod or even in vanilla since 1203 adds the tick command
this is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game and then go one tick at a time and see exactly whats happening and when
incredibly informative grian and scar can now fix docs giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 
i think this makes the whole process so much cooler even if in total its fairly simple

oh



huge credit to avatardotpng for making 90 of this base with help from maximumg9 chessjames dwinkley calamitas wato and me

there is one thing all these youtubers should know

the only safe house in minecraft is a hidden one
mumbo jumbo
oh boy this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these 
yeah these safest bases are usually pathetically easy to enter their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create easy defenses that are redundant and pointless serving to introduce more vulnerability
i thought this base was really secure but then i had a very good idea i used f5 see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and i was able to see that this base was insecure
i knew he would debunk it eventually while watching i was like bro kenadian is going to destroy this lol
lesson learned next time you want to build a base watch out for kenadians in the wild
yer the base is kinda dumb it only works if you obey very specific rules and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare

all these safest bases just dont work without other mods commands datapacks etc to add additional mechanics

still thanks for showing just how easy it is
when kenadian is bored he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things
1 im glad carvs was a good sport about this its always nice to see someone who can take a joke
2 i was thinking the exact same things when i was watching his video i was like couldnt someone just fly or build through this whole thing this design seems super exploitable
someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools damn this is a safe base
kenadian beating it without taking damage hold my beer
231 322 i love the little detail of while hes explaining why this base is actually secure hes just chilling in the middle of the danger zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
this safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremodenew to minecraft
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
i looked at this base and thought it was very secure but then i had a very good idea  i used blocks see using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armorpotions simple
the fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point mad respect
is easier to destroy than to create no base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base

the last time olivia rodrigo performed a tiny desk concert it was two years ago in a deserted dmv office back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldnt play the real desk but this year the singersongwriter returned bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the npr music office its much cooler to be here rodrigo says i was saying earlier ive never been starstruck by a room before

many of the songs on guts which earned a special recommendation on npr musics best albums of 2023 list blow out rodrigos sound into colorful grungy poprock fit for a stadium like love is embarrassing performed here with rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar but the artist builds her set out with guts cuts that fit the intimate setup like the searing vampire her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines or the potent ode to female jealousy lacy which rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class by the end of her set shes completely alone at the piano for the sobering making the bed and its not difficult to see why shes one of pops most promising rising performers

tiny desk and snl in the same weekend she is crushing it
her voice is so consistent with her album recordings that alone is so impressive
can we just also appreciate the band and the supporting vocalists they are amazing
set list
0002 love is embarrassing
0415 vampire
0922 lacy
1336 making the bed
lacy and making the bed contain some of olivias most deeply introspective and creatively complexed lyrics on the guts album  lacy vividly defines the internal experience of envy and poetically describes the psychological and emotional tugofwar raging inside of someone that both worships and despises another person who has become an obsession  making the bed defines the internal struggle of accepting the inevitable side effects that come with getting everything that one wants while holding oneself responsible for the decisions that lead to negative results  olivia has said in interviews that she is proud of the songs on guts that explore other topics outside of heartbreak and both of these songs reveal the expanding imagery and specificity of her writing that is both real and relatable especially when performed live
i still have not recovered from the cathartic snl performance and olivia strikes again with four of my favorite songs from guts love the drama and the vocals in each of these songs

the reason why i like this album so much is because i think it achieves what every artist hopes their followup album will  she is a very mature songwriter and you can hear her mature with her lyrics sour was fun and represented her age very well and i think guts does the samebut she has applied her deeper understanding of herself to her writing and has expressed some of her emotions more vulnerably while still remaining integral to her personal style which initially popularized her even lacy explores the concept of jealously on a much more intricate level than some of the songs on her previous album this is a beautiful second album and such a fluid transition from sour im excited to see what else she puts out in the future
its just incredible how she has a beautiful voice even when she has no auto tune or edits its amazing and an anomaly truly

quick edit ahhh almost 100 likes
 this was far and away one of the best performances by olivia ever finally she sang one of the best songs off guts making the bed which she sang beautifully also lacy was perfect too olivia is so gracious and polite its so refreshing
the energy and joy she puts into love is embarrassing really makes it stand out and come alive relative to the recorded version  shes having fun and it shows  all aree great of course
the personality the talent the kindness we truly made the right artist famous thank you olivia rodrigo 
she is absolutely incredible i love that she took a poetry class and it turned into a song making the bed blew me away
finally us love is embarrassing fans are getting to hear it performed its so good
her tiny desk performances are always so good

music by kevin macleod httpsincompetechcom",2540,"missy is just literally the chillest creature out of everyone in this game shes so kumbaya and i need that i wish i had her energy
given how poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this i do hope she wont become this final hidden main antagonist
the fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is lowkey respectable great job man
i actually theorize that we wont meet catnap as this giant monster right away but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat however once he learns that poppy apposes the prototype it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form keep in mind that catnap can adjust the proportions of his body hes a sizeshifter
this game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
the character that is being tortured and strapped is dogday the leader of the smiling critters dogday is also the one of the screenshot coming out of a large tube we see him chasing the player on the trailer as well coming out of that same tube i believe that the guy on the phone saying this is what he does to heretics etc is dr harley the doctor sawyer from project playtime i am not sure but his voice is surely the same voice actor the dr was also the one responsible for the monsters the project being called the bigger bodies innitiative
the little critters were so cute in a creepy way seeing them with long human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel for me that made them look scarier than the plushie version i also noticed the stitches on the arms if they are working with the prototype maybe it helped make them biggertaller and safer we know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys
ill be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 
the scratch on the wall fully says fate awaits those who believe also that character we see tied up actually looks like the dog it has the same ears and if you look closely that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth this character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us
i think 1901 says peace awaits those who believe im really excited for the game though thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us mike
chapter 3 is lookin very good so far also massive props to mob entertainment just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story just cant wait to see it now xd
man i cant even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see catnap and something tells me that this is going to be the scariest chapter ever
my theory on nightmare huggy is that its the same one from chapter one but under the influence of catnap who saw how obedient huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again  through catnaps orders
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went wild  or rabid  the fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting cant wait to see  whos the real bad guy or something
given how much information is in this next chapter i wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe theyll do one more and then end the game it seems like were going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so i would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype also i just thought of this but its possible the player is a toy themselves if they were a bigger bodies toy they would be working in the factory have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged
one of the biggest things i cannot wait for is seeing how the player and poppy interact with kissy but why do i have this strange feeling like red flags are being raised that shell sacrifice herself to save poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter

idk id be happy if kissy lived but i guess we will have to wait and see
yo the voice lines from poppy it sounds so chilling shes actively trying to save people and kissy missy yes i knew she would be involved that would actually be so cool i really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people not just you were secretly the bad guy
one important aspect is that the smiling cirtters or atleast catnap are made entirely of a special fluid material that gives them the ability to manifest their form they can be as small as a mouse or as tall as a giraffe
knowing kissy will help us in this chapter i cant help but fathom that shell probably face off against against catnap near the end of the chapter to maybe buy us some time to escape

a two hour tutorial so you cant refund the game is genius
the way chris utilized his speech organs to tell you he was chris is why this shouldve been awarded game of the day before
i love how when you shoot a zombie it reacts a moment after you hit it this realism is truly ahead of its time
the fact that you managed to encounter some zombies puts you ahead of a bunch of other reviewers ive seen
that division subtraction joke was fucking brilliant
your speech organs seem fine

real actual dialogue
your speech organs seem fine being one of the first things you hear in this game is truly something else man
calling this game subtraction as a reference to division is actually a stroke of genius
that part where you shot the zombie in the head and its head exploded 3 full seconds later was great this is truly one of the games of all time
lost it at can you tell me about your zombie fighting tactics
nobody is talking about how he selected the last of us as the game this is pure gold as always thelastdunkle delivers
not try getting up or try standing up or try walking around

no they went with try getting off the bed a very realistic line that a real person would definitely say
this game makes me appreciate actual video game artists 1000x more
it cracks me up that the description for the roamer class at the beginning says with the onset of the apocalypse you set a goal to change your life for the better like how and why does the apocalypse inspire someone to start improving their life if they were a drunkard before 
dunkeys wisecracks in this were some of his best for sure you can tell the power of dad jokes are beginning to course through his veins
its extremely funny to me that a day after posting this video the studio behind this game announces theyre closing
walking around an empty city truly makes this a strandtype game
when gollum was released daedalic ended up closing their studios over a month later 
this game releases and fntastic studios closes up 4 days later the game has also since been removed from the steam marketplace

givesyouwings f1",959,"vettel next please dont make us beg for it it just simply has to happen
happy for dc he put a lot of effort into building up this team glad he got to drive their best car to this date
for all the work dc has done for rb to lay the foundation for what it is today he absolutely deserves to experience such masterpiece of machinery now i wanna see newey webber and vettel in the rb19 as well
dc is one of the smartest funniest and most knowledgeable lads around and its an absolute joy to watch every time he does coverage for f1 its so amazing to see him tear up the track like an absolute pro
red bull is kind of company which takes a good care of its drivers sebastian buemi and dc are still under rbs payroll mark webber had rb money in his pocket years after he retired from f1 the company still supports marc marquez in motogp despite hes been riding for rival teams since rbktm partnership and alex albon during 2022 season in williams had it as personal sponsor he separated from rb just because the nature of mercedeswilliams cooperation
kudos to red bull i wish we had more sponsors like it
lovely seeing that scottish flag on the rb19s monocoque dc is the reason why i ever watched f1 in the first place  why i follow this team 
thank you red bull and christian for letting dc take a lap in a truly beautiful powerful dominant and aweinspiring machine
its a shame he only got one lap i would have liked to see him get fully comfortable over the course of a day
52 years old in an current gen era car is fantastic you can see the old school early 2000s trackline approach 
quite a reward from horner to a person who was dare to left mclaren mercedes and switched to a new team run by drink company and develop the car from not competitive into very dominating
 
also how people remember dc nowadays  schumacher angry pitlane meme
i have a huge amount of respect for dc he helped this team go forward and i think the team know this
dc is hands down the most likeable person in f1 you just cannot hate this man an absolute legend
the whitty humor of dc love it  and the comeradery within the team is so wonderful to see how liam fits right in gp there this was filmed on drs tyre testing day at silverstone i think few days after silverstone gp thats why horner was there too i just love the humor and the fun rbr has while working hard with full focus
the guy that helped get newey to rb gets to drive some of newey s best work beautiful to see
david is such a great guy he deserved this opportunity
the cars are very easy to drive
 liam lawson the man who replaced ricciardo after he crashed who replaced a de vries that couldnt stop crashing
thanks dc and red bull for an ear to ear smile throughout
liam comes across as a thoroughly decent guy
not my team but they seem to promote a family feel
very enjoyable
ive had the pleasure to work with dc on several occassions for these kinds of red bull productions and he really is just as likeable genuin humble and professional in person as he comes across in the content 
he gives everyone the same amount of respect and time such a gentleman
dc was my favorite driver when i was a kid i just loved something about him and now he is my favorite f1 promoter he still looks to be in great shape talks passionately and throws jokes all the time such a joy to watch him so nice of rb to let him drive the current car for a change he definitely deserved it

this needs a follow up video about scars  what they do to your skin what cells are involved and why they can stay around for years or your entire life
as a doctor watching this and knowing all the process already im still amazed by the animation and the details in it from the skin layers to the morphology of cells and the whole process omg its unbelievable
i always wondered how the ink managed to stay in place if the skin was constantly getting replaced and while this makes a lot of sense at the same time its stranger than anything i wouldve imagined the immune system is a beautiful thing

ive always been on the fence when it comes to getting a tattoo most of the people i know have tattoos with great sentimental value attached to them be it about remembering loved ones or representing a difficult time in their life that they overcame etc meanwhile i could only ever come up with tattoo ideas referencing video games i liked

after learning how much trauma i would have to put my poor immune system buddies through in order to get a tattoo im especially glad ive held off on getting one
2 episodes in a week lets hope that the animation and writing team arent in crunch mode to produce these at a quicker pace
having a background in histology makes me appreciate how cleanly you guys portray stuf like fibroblasts and stratified epithelium
i learned that tattoo ink is picked up by lymphatic vessels and transported to the next lymph nodes where it gets stuck and that the colour can eventually be seen if you actually look at those lymph nodes it was also said that there hasnt been any known case of exceeding the lymph nodes capacity by having lots of tattoos
i wonder why the body would rather keep the ink in place than try to transport it away and at least try to filter it out via the lymphatic system
as someone who is heavily tattooed this is fascinating i had a basic understanding of what was going on but this really helps visualize and clarify also once after a very long session trying to finish a full sleeve my lymph node in my armpit swelled up and was very sensitive my doc who is also tattooed said it is common and that is was my system getting a bit overwhelmed with the amount of excess ink it was trying to move through the system with some heat light massage and hydration my immune system recovered in about a day and is back to kicking ass
as a dermatologist watching this i can say that you guys really did great deep research about this  well done the presentation is pretty good
a accidentally gave myself a tattoo on the knuckle when i was 17 i accidentally tagged myself with the disc of an angle grinder my dad would remove the safety guards long after the the deep abrasion healed it had a blueblack colour not sure what the ink was i guess bits of grinder disc metal or paint after more than 20 years it still hasnt fully faded but now i know why its still there awesome video as always kurzgesart
ah now i get why my husbands tattoo artist who is known in the area for being extremely cautios about sanitary and health safety refused to tattoo me and recommended not doing it at all 
the fact aside that im allergic to ppd which is not in the tattoo paint he uses after seeing my other allergies turpentine aka fragrances metals benzocaine etc all being contact allergies he told me that i must be sick rarely but when i am im over the top out of it and yeah thats true  plus my body temperature is naturally nearly 1 c below average so what other consider a slight fever makes me feel like im cooking inside
well he told me that my immune system is overdoing it literally taking out machine guns to fight off flies so giving me a tatoo even avoiding my allergy triggers would throw my immune system into world war mode and could cause serious  if not permanent  damage i didnt really get how a tattoo could do that i guess now i do dang and i really wanted a full back tattoo all my life
thank you immune system for defending me even when im in the wrong
on one hand i think i can safely say i definitely not getting a tattoo

on the other hand i now appreciate my body a lot more hooray for immune systems
sometimes parts of some of my older tattoos will randomly raise and get itchy and ive always thought it might be because my immune system was fighting off something it seems that may have been correct after all

football rizespor ankaragucu superlig farukkoca turkey news",468,"such a massive embarrassment to the turkish people there needs to be some extremely harsh consequences for this or we will just see it replicated some time in the future this is a great example of what losing control of your emotions can result in
absolutely disgusting behaviour prison is the only place for these people
the guy that kicks him in the face while lying on the floor is even worse than the guy who threw the first punch
real men doesnt do such illmannered offensive things real men behave themselves
absolutely disgusting behavior  very immature hope all involved in the assult on the ref get arrested
he was kicked by another guy on the right as well  hope they dont miss it
the kick was worse then the punch
i hope that ref is okay
ive seen the behaviour of grassroots football in the uk and that can be quite bad 
ive havent seen anyone assaulted but its come close a few times and the abuse hurled at refs by fans players coaches can be awful
just to say that a year ago this guy took a fair play award
so cheap shots him and then someone kicks him while he is unprotected class keep watching soccer gents we dont want you in rugby games
if this happens to all leagues anthony taylor would have been dead years ago 
if it happened in england english clubs would be thrown out of every competition going it wont be dealt with the same way here though
and people wonder why we have a referee shortage
kicking a man while he is down is simply pathetic
im not condoning this behaviour as its wrong on every level but i believe theres a simple reason why it happens or why theres a strong potential for it to happen at any top level game  the reason is that theres far too much money involved in the modern game growing it into a monstrous entity worldwide  this places pressure to perform upon managers and players pressure from sponsors etc to win games and trophies  it has grown too big too fast and needs calming measures applied
before something worse than this punch happens
turkiye boyle bilinsinnustemezdik
even his captain was shocked 
the neck brace 
that hospital scene like something out of a comedy sketch that punch wouldnt have knocked over a 5 year old
very often such thuggish behaviour can be attributed to the culture of course this should not be deemed as an excuse you should have seen the crowd trouble in indonesian football stadia the players too get consumed by the events  the spectators would be wondering if they are watching a kung fu spectacle

honestly bethesda owes modders millions for fixing their games all these years
quick update had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the house building song from rdr2 all i basically say is that the bounty system in starfield is even worse than rdr2 and being a pirate is so discouraged its borderline impossible anyways thanks so much for watching this video  i was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it  big ups to the whole island 
jacob
an amazing and high quality video as always jakey i seriously appreciate you mentioning how good skyrims ost is since thats like the king of music for me fyi the audio cuts out at 2948  3005 and 3015  3023
really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing the flow the script the scene choices the cutaway timing all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same new but nostalgic this is a huge development in the nakeyjakey career path maybe getting a bit wiser  cant wait to see a new video in like 3 years
1655 as a parent of a toddler seeing this ms rachel spoof sent me it was really well done and to be clear we absolutely adore ms rachel in my house
for a year before starfields launch my manager couldnt stop talking about it he would go on and on about how it was everything hes ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched

last week he came poked his head out from the other room and asked what was the name of that space game we used to play dude couldnt even remember the name of it anymore now granted my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid his favorite movie of all time is battlefield earth i know but i still feel like this means something
that clip of todd howard saying how he told everyone hed make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
dear jacob

another fantastic video as always i really liked the style of cinematography in this one it was obviously different than your usual style but thats not a bad thing by any means it felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend 

ive been following your content since 2017  went all the way through high school and am starting college now always looking forward to the next jarby video thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us and enjoy the holidays
an entire town wanting you dead in skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly but the idea that starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what youve done is the funniest thing ive heard all week
i think the signs were there a long time agoi played es4 oblivion extensivelywasnt perfect but i still had a lot of fun with itwhen skyrim came out i was hyped but i never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after i got it it was exceptionally underwhelming i still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line eg i always preferred dark brotherhood and thieves guild storyline over fighting dragons then something has gone terribly wrong
something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every unexplored frontier planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it im not exploring and finding something new im just playing tourist it would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot 35
thank you for finally putting into words why i just could not get into starfield i am a huge bethesda fan  i have been playing skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes along with the fallout games i wanted to love starfield so much but after a few hours i just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there i also think youre one of the few people who shares my opinion on fallout 3s atmosphere vs new vegas so i appreciate the nod to that as well
starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isnt fun and theres like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn
3333 funny thing about the item vacuum in jail the items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower early game its actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared lock pick your stuff back then be on your way

awesome back and forth seth gave me flashbacks to the infamous punk  hangman promo at one point seth and punk built a level of tension and intrigue rarely done two of the very best there are

cant wait to see this feud play out
finally after more than a decade wwe is making me want to tune in every week again triple h has absolutely killed it since taking over punk and rollins feud is going to be 
that is a promo no random swear words no random mockery no randomly praising the fans straight to the point
dam that stare down was legendary 
this segment was everything i wanted seth roasting punk and punk just takes it and it more focused winning the battle by taking seths title  such good writing
what a time to be alive as wwe fans 
im still trying to process this cm punk back in wwe never thought id see it but then again never thought bret hart and hbk would make peace
rollins just delivered one of his greatest promos and with cm punk just standing there he also told one of the greatest stories hes ever told without saying a word except for just a few bravo we are watching history folks
there is no better promo love him or hate him cm punk makes tv time money
its so hard to believe he left the company 10 years ago and hes officially back in the wwe he has went through hell with his sports career so i salute him
punk back in wwe is actually pretty cool
this wasnt seth rollins talking to cm punk this was colby lopez talking to phil brooks
this segment ruled both men killed it 
this was the promo ive been waiting for but even then i didnt expect ol seth to go in on him that hard seth must really have some serious anger towards punk and they must have told him to let it all out on the  ",17,Sports,5130000,PT15M5S,"['seth rollins and punk both absolutely killed what amazing segment this', 'this seth best promo date', 'are witnessing the start feud that destined down one the greatest feud wwe history', 'did not_ expect see them face face already punk did not_ have say much just save for later', 'punk rollins night and cody night that would one the best mania like year', 'one whole minute with word fighting just two men with lot shared history staring each other the eye poetry', 'awesome back and forth seth gave flashback the infamous punk hangman promo one point seth and punk built level tension and intrigue rarely done two the very best there are', '', 'cannot wait see this feud play out', 'finally after more than decade wwe making want tune every week again triple absolutely killed since taking over punk and rollins feud going', 'that promo random swear word random mockery randomly praising the fan straight the point', 'dam that stare down legendary', 'this segment everything wanted seth roasting punk and punk just take and more focused winning the battle taking seth title such good writing', 'what time alive wwe fan', 'still trying process this punk back wwe never thought see but then again never thought bret hart and hbk would make peace', 'rollins just delivered one his greatest promos and with punk just standing there also told one the greatest story ever told without saying word except for just few bravo are watching history folk', 'there better promo love him hate him punk make time money', 'hard believe left the company year ago and officially back the wwe went through hell with his sport career salute him', 'punk back wwe actually pretty cool', 'this not_ seth rollins talking punk this colby lopez talking phil brook', 'this segment ruled both men killed', 'this the promo have been waiting for but even then did not_ expect old seth him that hard seth must really have some serious anger towards punk and they must have told him let all out the']",905

now he knows what its like to play the chiefs 
the call was 100 correct chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
for those who didnt watch snf tonight

this penalty was called once in 2021 twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season 

so it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials and the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasnt some conspiracy 

mahomes reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled
there has been a lot of bad officiating this season 

this was an example of good officiating
hes looking at the baaaaaaaall  and still line up off sidewow
chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldnt happen at such an important point of the game  we should go back and see what the eagles think about the holding call in the super bowl last year chiefs werent complaining then
never understood why any player whatever the position would line up offside  these guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do  you dont even have to move your bod just use a couple of neck muscles turn your head and look  unbelievable
because the chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him the bills won this game and they dont even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral 
still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
if youre lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next to you to see the ball  youre offsides  how did toney not realize the ball and center was behind him
doesnt matter how many times it was called before you know the rules offsides is offsides end of story he could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches he knew the game was at stake and if he didnt know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known
he was looking right at the ball how could he not know to move back thats on him
whats shocking is that toney didnt drop the lateral from kelce
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral
ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
as a broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
it does look like offsides but what a cool play the chiefs are an amazing team
geez that was a great throw a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting td would have been fun in highlight reels kelce probably cant reenact that lastsecond pass what a shame",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S,"['congratulation bill you beat the chief and made them cry win for all football fan', 'now know what like play the chief', 'the call 100 correct chief have one blame but themselves', 'for those who did not_ watch snf tonight', '', 'this penalty called once 2021 twice last year and time coming into the game this season', '', 'obviously point emphasis for official and the flag thrown immediately upon the snap not_ some conspiracy', '', 'mahomes reaction really rubbing wrong and come off spoiled', 'there been lot bad officiating this season', '', 'this example good officiating', 'looking the baaaaaaaall and still line off sidewow', 'chief are arguing that such ticky tack call should not_ happen such important point the game should back and see what the eagle think about the holding call the super bowl last year chief were not_ complaining then', 'never understood why any player whatever the position would line offside these guy have been playing this game their whole life and are the best what they you not_ even have move your bod just use couple neck muscle turn your head and look unbelievable', 'because the chief have gotten many favorable call over the year mahomes wanted all the spotlight him the bill won this game and they not_ even get applauded for because the only thing that people are going remembering from this game this play where the penalty rightly called mahomes doe not_ need get mad the ref need get mad his receiver for lining offside', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'still one the best play seen this year bad toney did not_ look where standing', 'you are lined receiver and you have look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next you see the ball you are offside how did toney not_ realize the ball and center behind him', 'doe not_ matter how many time called before you know the rule offside offside end story could have just easily went the line and moved his foot back few inch knew the game stake and did not_ know offside then the person next him should have known', 'looking right the ball how could not_ know move back that him', 'what shocking that toney did not_ drop the lateral from kelce', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'have always wondered why back lateral were not_ used more they are used effectively flag football know there contact bit easier but done correctly there alot open play for tds like this one', 'bronco fan put joy heart seeing him like this', 'doe look like offside but what cool play the chief are amazing team', 'geez that great throw great catch and amazing pas ending with exciting would have been fun highlight reel kelce probably cannot reenact that lastsecond pas what shame']",65

jacob is a phenomenal actor
lou vic and jake on one episode of game changer thats 100 going to be a banger
i love getting all worked up for a new dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
the way my heart caught in my throat when jacob started yelling at sam
love that bdg is doing a lot of stuff with dropout nowadays
i cant tell you how excited i am to see nathan on dropout again please please please more collabs with the drawfee hosts their gremlin energy is just what i need 
seeing nathan actually makes me a little emotional drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropoutch but im glad to see some drawfeedropout mixing is still possible
i saw jacob storm out and then the tv says do something great for the trailer i mean i had to pause the trailer because i started dying of laughter
well jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 
the fact that i was not scared at all jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of dropout
more vic more brennan meltdowns and more grant skin yes please also i love how upset a producer was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos 
bdg sungwon and nathan the already incredible cast is only getter better 
im so excited
im stoked as always and i just wanted to say that the that should cut good shows such respect for your audience and we hardly ever see that in reality tv nicely done yall
bdg and sungwon graduating from make some noise to game changer proper plus caldwell and nathan making their game changer debuts oh yeah this is gonna be a good season
love how the marketingthroughline of this series keeps getting slightly more horrorthriller with each season
jesus jacobs acting legitimately got me there for a second
im so relieved jacob wasnt actually upset i teared up a bit lol
im so excited for nathan drawfee hopefully this will lead to more drawfeedropout crossovers in the future i need some more snilk and drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
im so excited to see nathan as a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan im happy to see you folks doing stuff together even after drawfee went independent i hoped thered be some crossovers still and im not disappointed i see why you didnt have karina shes too powerful although shed rock in a yugioh episode of um actually

 fcbarcelona",1219,"fully deserved win for girona michel outwit xavi tactically and with his substitutions too cooked the defebce all game and cut through the midfield like a knife through butter eric garcia decided to turn into maldini against his parent club what a season they are having
lewa missed one clear chance scored and delivered many successful passes why so much hate on him we scored many goals because of him last season our top scorer is still him am i wrong talk more about our defence about gundogan missing million chances along with some bad passes talk about our defences position last half what about cancelo and joao being selfish raphinhas trillion shots ending up outside the court cmon culers youre better than this
a levantar cabeza y a seguir adelante no ms difcil derrota pero se debe luchar hasta el final siempre bara 
o girona t demonstrando um futebol digno e humildeboa respectiva em l liga
girona is doing a legendary tale in la liga taking down on of the giants of the league and could even make it to the ucl next season or even win the league
a painful blow to barcelona fans girona they deserve a loss a welldeserved win and a lead 
rafinha is the quintessential manifestation of everything wrong with wingers tactics that involve wingplay and the death of brazilian futbal brutal
of all the games this season this game is the most understandable loss girona did very well we need to get it together and move on
girona played exceptionally well and were even reminiscent of how we used to play back in the day a truly embarrassing display though theres no passion or anger when we concede anymore our players just hang their heads and go on about it if i were the coach i would be furious at this shocking mentality of my players they have to remember that they play for fc barcelona and that means to give it their absolute all every single match theres no ferocity no intensity or that sheer hunger to destroy our opponents and win games anymore other clubs used to fear us and for good reason 

im so disappointed as a bara fan now of 14 years and to see these issues not being addressed and fixed especially at this level of football its completely unacceptable and ridiculous i need a drink and i dont drink goodnight
el partido que ms me ha dolido esta temporada la verdad falta mentalidad ganadora donde estaba el bara competitivo del partido pasado contra el atleti donde estuvo el compromiso la unin  el ritmo  el buen juego del partido pasado un bara tan dinmico  sin estas cosas no vamos a llegar a ningn lado y no se que har xavi pero la mentalidad del equipo tiene que cambiar a bien pero bueno a seguir a delante que tenemos que remontar en laliga no podemos dejar que se nos escape porque la calidad la tenemos
love how we see barcas goal multiple times in all angles and gironas goals are just shown once
its crazy that this back 3 was consistently being rock solid through out the last season but apparently forget how to defend this match
gironas game has changed drastically this season it feels like a dream
i cant believe girona playing a wonderful match 
congrats for our catalan friends girona they totally outplayed us and showed that definitely deserve the title some of our players seriously have to think about their form this season we are awful for 16 matches we have conceded 18 goals so far by comparison for the whole previous season we conceded 20 goals well be stronger better times will come for us visca barca 
as a barca fan am really happy for girona but for the entire barca team the least said about them the better
go girona  super campeonato que est fazendo com pouco oramento comparado com os 03 grandes da la liga
yes i know that girona have been great all season long putting up big performances throughout the year but this is truly unacceptable we are fc barcelona ffs 
well done girona yall got yourself a wonderful team this year

redfalcon gaming mario",474,"wubbas fate is still tragic but congrats to the winner what a welldeserved victory
that was a masterpiece a total rollercoaster of emotions even the man with no tear ducts that cant cry shed tears for our fallen warriors we love you hoppy and rip metal mario the original under dog
this one is special to us i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible 
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops that was a wild vid
even though hoppy cat won congrats to medal mario for being the underdog
this video is the true definition of tragic i rooted for metal mario the whole way through but he came just short but congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory
why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream cant wait for the faster mario kart to become a vid 
but how far can the hoppycat go
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did he deserved first he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection even if metal mario only got second he had to work for it im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it werent for that level and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
mods are already so crazy im so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds
the fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasnt possible is impressive itself
this is crazy i havent seen the end yet but this is gonna be interesting every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting
as a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win
you should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go and i already know hell be going to world 4 at least since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels i was rooting for them and am so happy they won
id love to see hoppycat beat the game always love the little enemies
great video so many twists and turns as a long time red falcon fan i must say im loving these new videos and editing style
wonder how far the wubba wouldve made it if water levels werent required i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game
fantastic video love the concept execution and editing

vgg cadillac",9285,"i worked for cadillac as a district service manager when that car was introduced in prerelease service meetings it was wellknown from the very beginning that the 864 was planned to be a oneyearonly engine the big problem was the early delco electronics the map sensor was calibrated with tooclose tolerances if the engine hicupped backfired it would shut down there was no repair except to replace the map sensor the bigger problem was replacement stock was the exact same part and it took gm a while before an updated unit could be supplied dealers would disconnect the 864 feature running it as an 8cyl only the press had a field day i inspected a limo in west palm beach florida that the owner wanted all the interior chrome replaced someone had discharged a tear gas device inside the car that caused the damage  the interior chrome pieces came from different suppliers so it was impossible for all of it to be defective and i denied the claim it turned out the limo was owned by the owner of the newspaper the national inquirer famous for stories like i got pregnant by an alien etc they went on a huge hate campaign smearing the vehicle which only threw fuel on the fire those were tough times to be a cadillac district service manager
as a 35 year mechanic i want to say that i admire derek for messing with that aggravating thing respect
the brake drum has traveled farther than the vehicle itself man that was classic
god i love me an old school caddy
the cadillac of despair what a test of wits and perseverance i felt for you through all of it while still bursting into laughter a number of times what an extraordinary episode thanks derek for actually putting this one out 
oh man that brake drum divorcing itself from the vehicle was epic it totally went with the whole project my experience with tbi dumping fuel was the coolant temp sensor 2 wire funny enough the computer relied on coolant temp for fuel mapping could be bad injectors maybe great video laughed a lot
this revival will be a top favorite now just for the amount of genuine laughs as things kept progressively happening the brake drum and the flame out of the  tbi  youre the best man thank you for what you do
what a fight i think this is a great candidate for a junkyard ls or a good old 350
way to keep on fighting through i wouldve thrown in the towel way earlier
i dont think gm tbi fuel injection from the 80s worked like a modern ecu it was a while ago but i think they start in open loop mode with a fixed map on temperature manifold pressure and throttle position once it warms up it switches to closed loop mode where it mostly uses the o2 sensor i bet when it was running good it was because it was in closed loop mode getting it to run long enough to switch to closed loop looked difficult though
id love to see round 2 there are several struggles you had that ive learned from
appreciate the perseverance i would really like to see this thing run and drive even if it means a carb swap or something else along those lines i just dont think this should be how it ends with this rig
man you really worked for every bit of that one

thanks for everything you do
awesome as usual very interesting how the critters migrated the under hood insulation to the exhaust system
even though she didnt drive home this was still a fantastic episode the patience perseverance and diagnostic progression you show is truly impressive shout out to oreilly for the support absolutely loved the brake drums desire to get back on the road
we loved this episode my wife cracked up when the brake drum shot across the shop you cant let this thing beat you toss a modern efi system on it and make it a super nice take momma out to dinner rig
i definitely want to see a carburetor swap and a general engine bay cleanup where you get rid of as many hoses and wires as possible
this has to be one of my favorite episodesthe runaway brake drum fleeing the scene and then the fire in the holeabsolutely hilarious  i laughed so hard my dogs starting barking at me
hell of an effort i dont think ive seen you slither the floor that much ever the launch of the drum was classic my brotherinlaw and some other students at an agriculture engineering school in mo began the design on this engine in the 70s for an ag engine not a passenger car the story goes that the college sold the idea to gm and they took it and proceeded to wreck it 
great effort
im only about half way through the video so far but man does it make me feel good watching you go through many of the struggles i go through on my cadillac  it makes me feel so much more normal lol
derek what a great episode i was really hoping you would get this thing going but props to you for showing that everything does not always go as planned and showing that sometimes even when we do our best we still fail but it is best to learn from this experience so what would i like to see done with his vehicle well i would like to see it moving down to the road the 368 cadillac is a great engine and very durable and reliable as long as it doesnt have this particular fuel delivery system also it is the last of the cadillac v8 so first thing and youve already done this disconnect the cylinder deactivation as most cadillac dealers did and let it run as a v8 secondly remove all of the fuel injection paraphernalia from 1981 and replace it with some type of holley fuel injection system and then make sure its ship shape and maybe give it away i mean i would would like to own of these if it had a reliable fuel delivery system just my two cents thanks again for another great video",2,Autos

we have to appreciate how talented these artists are
imagine being close enough with mr beast that he just sends you thousands of chocolate bars friendship goals
sculpting is a difficult thing to do with chocolate painting on a canvas with chocolate is easier kenz would have done equally good if she also decided to paint with chocolate but cant say for the guy who won if he would have chosen to sculpt
honestly davids piece was amazing nothing against everyone else but david was 10 levels above everyone in this challenge
the fact that they put there time just to make us entertained i love yall

man seeing these talented individuals make such wonderful art out of the craziest things makes me wish i could do the same thing xd

davids piece was just so beautiful for being made out of melted chocolate like dayum i honestly loved mackenzies piece as well it was just so detailed and amazing looking and i feel like if she wasnt punished so much she wouldve definitely had enough time to make a full body to attach to the head to make it look even more epic than it already did and it seriously wouldve been a hard decision and a super close win i honestly really loved michelles piece it was just super adorable and honestly deserved top 3 3
davids painting is amazing  love his style  michelles squid and mackenzies dino skeleton was really good and realistic

horror outro  httpssoundcloudcomshurkofficialhaunted",3295,"mark being so confident in his answers then immediately being told hes wrong by the game is honestly one of the funniest things
mark being so suspicious and running from a man whos just casually walking past him is oddly funny to me
mark giving a stranger the longest nickname gotta be my favourite part
mark doing an accidental jumpscare by doing the posters one at a time is hilarious to me
imagine this from the npcs perspective it must be hilarious you have another person who runs up yells at the walls screaming this is different and then runs in the opposite direction
i like how 90 seconds into this game marks already lost his mind calling a totally harmless bystander mr mustache receding hairline phone in left hand briefcase in right no socks white shirt black pants man
markiplier perfectly yet unintentionally summed up his content in one quote i have a feeling now that im gonna be utterly confident and then somethings going to go horrifically wrong 2120
mark blindly following the rule of hugging the left wall to an annoying degree but completely ignoring all the posters is such a weird dichotomy of rule followingbreaking
the briefcase guy oh no not this guy again just keep walkig john dont look at him dont say a word just go ahead and forget about him

mark anytime he sees him well well look who it is
mark doing the quick 180 after he sees the man smiling killed me
mark what did i do wrong
the most obvious door knob in the center of the door 
1210 so as we see there was indeed an anomaly that graphical glitch was indeed indicative of an anomaly he should have turned around for 
the anomaly was that the posters on the wall were growing the graphical glitch was the frame edge of the poster clipping through marks vision
we need the full uncut version of this gotta see mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for an hour
imagine youre just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keeps staring at you and when you finally decide to stare back they cut you off and dont let you continue walking  1248
mark should do more of these kind of games its funny how he gets frustrated
i love games like this nothing super flashy and there arent really any in your face jump scares but the way its set up and the ambiance messes with your head and starts making you more and more paranoid questioning everything
this is actually such a neat concept and one of the better games ive seen mark play
him missing the one that literally tells him to turn back is actually really funny idk why 
i like these types of lets plays because the audience can kind of play along
i usually dont enjoy these types of games but this one was so fun but this one had the looping element and the numbers to tell you if youre on the right track that made it so much fun for me especially since mark kept dying at the worst times getting to 8 so many times just to loop again is truly a nightmare this must be what hell is like",20,Gaming,36000000,PT36M39S,"['mark being confident his answer then immediately being told wrong the game honestly one the funniest thing', 'mark being suspicious and running from man who just casually walking past him oddly funny', 'mark giving stranger the longest nickname got favourite part', 'mark doing accidental jumpscare doing the poster one time hilarious', 'imagine this from the npc perspective must hilarious you have another person who run yell the wall screaming this different and then run the opposite direction', 'like how second into this game mark already lost his mind calling totally harmless bystander mustache receding hairline phone left hand briefcase right sock white shirt black pant man', 'markiplier perfectly yet unintentionally summed his content one quote have feeling now that going utterly confident and then something going horrifically wrong 2120', 'mark blindly following the rule hugging the left wall annoying degree but completely ignoring all the poster such weird dichotomy rule followingbreaking', 'the briefcase guy not_ this guy again just keep walkig john not_ look him not_ say word just ahead and forget about him', '', 'mark anytime see him well well look who', 'mark doing the quick 180 after see the man smiling killed', 'mark what did wrong', 'the most obvious door knob the center the door', '1210 see there indeed anomaly that graphical glitch indeed indicative anomaly should have turned around for', 'the anomaly that the poster the wall were growing the graphical glitch the frame edge the poster clipping through mark vision', 'need the full uncut version this got see mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for hour', 'imagine you are just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keep staring you and when you finally decide stare back they cut you off and not_ let you continue walking 1248', 'mark should more these kind game funny how get frustrated', 'love game like this nothing super flashy and there are not_ really any your face jump scare but the way set and the ambiance mess with your head and start making you more and more paranoid questioning everything', 'this actually such neat concept and one the better game have seen mark play', 'him missing the one that literally tell him turn back actually really funny not_ know why', 'like these type let play because the audience can kind play along', 'usually not_ enjoy these type game but this one fun but this one had the looping element and the number tell you you are the right track that made much fun for especially since mark kept dying the worst time getting many time just loop again truly nightmare this must what hell like']",2199

richeisenshow nfl kansascitychiefs",4098,"maybe the officiating has been awful this year but this isnt an example of bad officiating  the referee did his job correctly
throwing the penalty flag without knowing what happens next is the most fair thing the ref can do in that situation and mahomes berating a ref because his team is struggling instead of holding his teammate accountable for the lack of discipline is crazy
the fact that he was clearly offsides but yet the media wants to have the convo should it have been called  especially rich being an nfl network employee  is mind boggling to me  because what this does is opens pandoras box of the league being rigged and choosing who they want to win by calling or not calling penalties
the game didnt end with a bad call it ended with three incomplete passes
kadarius actually looked at where the ball was and still lined up offsides he deserves it
i dont remember patrick mahomes complaining about all the defensive penalties called against kc opponents late in games during the playoffs past couple years  diva
the chiefs benefit from so many calls its nice to finally see  it balancing out a bit
mahomes had absolutely no problem with the bad unnecessary roughness late hit on the sideline last week
whether the penalty impacted the play is irrelevant a couple weeks ago the broncos missed field goal got called back because of 12 men on the field no shot that extra man impacted the field goal but you didnt see allen and mcdermott crying to the refs about making that call in such a critical moment its an objective call the chiefs need to take some accountability
rich just like the other mahomes lovers colin nick and the whole cast good morning football are like its mahomes dont throw penalties against them inside the 2 min warning  
offsides is like the most objective penalty in football you can go on about controversial pass interference calls because thats a bit more subjective of a call but offsides is about as clear as you can get
all that frustration from mahomes and reid needs to directed at tony not the officials  it was a helluva play but the guy that scored also committed an obvious foul
the most damning thing is that the penalty didnt end the game mahomes had multiple downs left to do something and he didnt thats what ended the game
i think rich misunderstood the refs answer to the pool reporter he said if the wr asked for advice hed give it insinuating toney didnt check first if he was barely offside they may choose to just warn them after the play but it was so egregious and there was no check so there was no way they could look the other way
didnt the chiefs win a couple of games earlier this year due to last minute officiating calls that were phantom calls im pretty sure one was with the jets
to make sure that there arent any misunderstandings the officials should stop letting the receivers know if they are lined up offsides or not
last week chiefs got a bad call on pi  they also benefitted from a bogus calls  roughing on qb no 10 second runoff on the reversal and another clock stoppage when receiver was going backwards and did not go out of bounds
rich brings back all the good espn memories    way to stay the same as you used to be
we had a kid a friend of mine in high school during a scrimmage game forget to put his mouth piece in before the snap  the ball is snapped a great play gaining many yards takes place all to be called back because my friend inadvertently didnt put in his mouth piece  have you ever seen a play in the pro game called back because of an equipment malfunction  game winning touchdown called back because tom brady threw a touchdown pass with his shirt tail hanging out  i havent  but until the chiefs game i had never seen an offside on the offense  then i saw it again sunday night when the cowboys did it against the eagles  it was mentioned that like a few hours before that this penalty has all the commonality of two men wearing the same jersey number at the same time on the field as was the case in a boise state game a couple years ago  but its a written rule  jay walking is a written traffic offense that not many if any policeman has ever enforced  but its a written rule  its in the script  it isnt the referees job to police the formations  one article i read asked the question was a warning in order  a warning  hey kadarius youre offside get you butt back over on your side  ok  hey bob hey pete you two are moving at the same time you cant do that  hey bill quit wiggling ill have to call you for a false start  its the players job to police themselves on the field and their coaches jobs to make sure they are lined up where they should be  not the ref side judge back judge or judge judy  when you look at the still photo kadarius is practically shaking hands with the defensive player in front of him  the flag was thrown the moment the ball was snapped not after the touchdown ceremony had been completed  patrick and andy had every right to be upset  the same way a person caught red handed breaking into a house has the right to complain while hes being cuffed

remarkable performance by haney simply elite that night props to prograis for not quitting and not making any excuses after his loss haney was just on another level
absolutely amazing experience for my first time ever going to be a boxing event the bay showed out and so did haney
ill definitely admit that i always thought devin haney was boring but i know that he is a great boxer with superb technical ability and skills he definitely showed his worth last night and i didnt go in expecting a knockout but he completely outclassed the other man i didnt figure his power with translate well at a higher weight class but it seems like his shots had more oomf
it was one of the best performance i have seen in boxing this year  thank you haney for producing a helluva performance 
haneys accuracy is amazing hes so precise idk why anyone calls him boring
helluva performance happy i got to experience it live we are definitely entering the devin haney era
haney has improved a lot he seems more technical than normal taking care of every blow and every step that is the essence of boxing
barely any holding stayed in front displayed his power with a knock down and making regis stumble twice complete shut out without taking much damage masterclass performance
devin haney is everything we wished adrian broner would be dude is on a path of greatness
i expected haney to win a competitive fight with a few scares along the way but he completely dominated regis such a masterclass performance so much technical brillance in this fight by haney

upset over a blatant penalty man if mahomes reacted like this over that imagine how he would have reacted if the chiefs got the same treatment the bills got in the bills eagles game refs totally screwed them
after looking at the replay our guy clearly lined up offsides the refs had to call it same type of dumbass move that we did in the afc championship several years ago when one of you defensive players lined up off side when we intercepted brady to nullify the play and lose the game mahomes needs to aim his anger in the right direction  his own man we deserved to lose and will cont to do so with this lousy offense too bad  wasting a very good defense this year
just a straight up fair amd square loss for the chiefs unfortunately they had an offsides that seemingly cost them the win or atleast lead really unprofessional and pathetic that your starting quarterback has a temper tantrum on the sidelines yelling at the refs for doing their jobs well
the chiefs had their chances to win and they didnt get it done
classic man gets so many calls his way over the years gets a few called against him and he has an aneurism
all i have to say is that chiefs fans got a little taste of what its like to be a bills fan for the last 30 years
legend has it that mahomes is still screaming on the sideline
via adam schefter on twitter

chiefs hc andy reid was not pleased that officials did not warn him that kadarius toney was lined up offsides the way they have in the past about the call the normally mildmannered reid said its a bit embarrassing for the national football league for that to take place
i get great joy from seeing the refs treat the chiefs like every other team in the league
this was amazing to see about time the refs make the correct call and stop making these calls for mahomes
to be honest there was still over a minute and the bills had timeouts to score a td no guarantee that offsides call not being called would have meant a chiefs win
ironic patrick mahomes and chiefs fans realizing what every other team has to go through when facing the chiefs
i want to watch a football game not a every time kelsie catches the ball we have to cut to taylor swifts reaction
there is absolutely a major problem with officials tainting games with either questionable calls or non calls  and completely subjective  penalties which on some occasions determines the outcome of the game 

this wasnt one of them even stevie wonder can see toney was way offsides here
no amount of cursing and yelling can deflect from the fact that they lost mahomes just made himself look like a spoiled unsportsman like loser
as a chiefs fan im embarrassed and mortified by the behavoir mahomes displayed it shows how badly winning has gone to his head and how inflated his ego is that he cant handle losing with some ounch of dignity even if he thought someone else was in the wrong
watched them take 3 games from us in the past cuz of calls like these i still remember a game were mahomes got intercepted 4 times and they all came back theyve been spoiled for too long now they think they should let little mistakes like these slide
i love how patrick mahomes can throw a tantrum in front of the world but when i do it at work i need to grow up

i watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
love how olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance  that applause was richly deserved
guts was such a masterpiece i cant wait for next album she literally never misses
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances 
this video demonstrates her creative ability so well and how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass 
being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire olivia never ceases to amaze me 
her breaking the glass part before the chorus is fabulous 
also the scream part is wow  her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
this is exactly what i would imagine an official mv for this song would be like and the fact that she performed it live just perfecf 
ok this performance was a moment also love how she didnt break character once the song was over and was getting applause she stood in that attitude  tongue out cake on the face those eyes glaring at you the intensity so perfect
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 
i love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile were happy and cheerful on the outside and i love the scream so much  thanks olivia 
this performance is insane olivia is such a hard worker her voice her emotions the way she looks is perfect im so grateful i am a teenage girl because of olivia
shes not just another pop queen  besides pop her music has some angst and an edge to it which is awesome  this performance was fantastic
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances
olivia entregando talento como sempre
being a fan since sourthis album blown away my expectations and the performance are just brilliant im a metal and rock listener and olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music hope to see a show of her someday great work
meu deus que performance ela quebrando a taa na virada da msica ficou incrvel
im so proud of her and her improvement in performance watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too 

im glad im going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music she saved me when the sour album dropped it meant a lot to me at that time im in my lowest point sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand i was 16 in my room all day and night because of tracks on sour i can accept my jealousy towards other girls i can relieve my anger towards my exboyfriend some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations like his new girlfriends name sounds so much like mine just slightly different

im 18 now i was so much happier than that time i moved on i forgive and forget i have a lot of new friends and good memories i got into a university and my studying great just like she said shes so much happier than the time when she wrote sour im so happy for her and myself 

hope she can do tour in my country
please come to asia thank u

it belongs to a pliosaur a ferocious marine reptile that terrorised the oceans about 150 million years ago

the 2mlong fossil is one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered and is giving new insights into this ancient predator

the skull will be featured in a special david attenborough programme on bbc one on new years day

palaeontology seacreatures bbcnews",4052,"wonderful to see sir david attenborough still active  bless you
thats looks like what a dragonskull would look like thats awesome
beside the big fossil lets not forget to admire the smaller one the amazing 97 year old sir david still standing tall rocking the boat telling us about it
early sailors may have found things like this and imagined sea monsters were still alive in the oceans thiis is amazing 
my god im a fisherman in california and ive just realized that i sold a huge squid beak to steve etches several years ago  he contacted me one day through my online ad saying he wanted one for his museum  i had totally forgotten his name until i saw this report  so honored to have one of my specimens on display in his collection to be viewed by hopefully many generations to come
paleontologists dream find i dont think this short story can adequately cover the magnitude of how incredible this discovery was and how serious steve etches is when he says he could spend the rest of his life with this fossil
the amount of human and natural history in the uk is mind blowing 
wow really amazing how well the skull is preserved the teeth look amazing i hope they find the whole fossilized pliosaur
the jurassic coast is known for its rich fossil record and this discovery is certainly significant
yes that is an amazing piece of history and a magnificent animal indeed but guys sir david attenborough is 97 years old and hes on a swaying boat that makes most young people seasick it is sir david attenborough that is the true beast of nature here folks seriously
fantastic as a child i was fascinated with dinosaurs and their cousins this still brings me joy 
glad to see sir david attenborough healthy and still contributing to the world of documentaries i was some how emotional seeing him in this video
if this was how terrifying life looked like millions of years ago on earth imagine whats out there in the universe in different shapes and forms absolutely fascinating
and this dwarfs the entire human existence  huge respect to these species to be able to go beyond millions of years
amazingly well preserved for a skull that big most of the time they are crushed to pieces and some of the pieces are just gone
i am in awe of this find having spent a few hours wandering along beaches on the jurassic coast i can imagine how excited the man who discovered this must have been 
fantastic find and a beautiful specimen
was great to be a part of this project hosting sir david attenborough on our boat snapper charters was a real career highlight
this reminds me a bit of that incredible ankylosaur fossil that was basically perfectly preserved pretty much the whole body not just the head 

and to think that fossilization in and of itself is already a very rare thing to start with and then to have a fossil like this is indeed incredible i cant recall the statistic on this but fossilization is a process that occurs only something like 5 of the time any living animal dies maybe less even if we were to unearth all the fossils from the crust of our planet today it would only represent a very small fraction of all the possible animal species  that quite possibly  well never know about because its possible that not a single specimen went through a successful fossilization process
i love this stuff  i contemplated paleontology for a bit but instead went for my masters in biological anthropology  i always geek out about these findings

i honestly didnt realize just how dumb water witches looked until this video i didnt realize it was so blatantly made up
great video  the hotel is  looking really good  the water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist
its crazy to watch how much progress youve made since 2020 the town looks great
we love your videos brent they dont all have to be well planned like they all are you could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same thanks for being a content creator
im not an expert hiker or trail blazer but i think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail  it would be safer for anyone that wants to see that beautiful view of the valley  keep up the fantastic work brent  im hoping to be able to get to cerro gordo within the next couple of years  till then i look forward to more and more video updates
brent you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees leaving stone cairns on a route for others to follow looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in oz happy festive season mate
theres nothing i want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
theres something magical about the sierras i was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at lake sabrina you can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning the calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless
yes dan is awesome love his channel so glad hes made an appearance
bravo brent  im so proud to have watched your first episodes of ghost town living way back in 2020  i never stopped  best channel on you tube  it never gets old  thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride  i will get to cerro gordo one day and visit  congratulations on a great month and merry christmas
hey brent what you are doing at cerro gordo is just simply amazing i am  a retired water treatment production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and i am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history  thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos i am envious of your accomplishments
cerro gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately but id love to visit if i had the chance your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from its amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on
ive been watching since before the hotel burnt down and im so glad that its being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
brent your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch i never miss an episode i would love to visit one day i am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun  maybe one day i could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully i can visit in the near future cheers
brett you are truly an inspiration to me and im sure many others i admire your commitment to youre amazing project that you have taken upon yourself with the help of others you have outstanding perseverance
it pleases me to preorder your book i now feel like i am just a small part of your world i hope to visit and meet you someday
   it is amazing that you have found your place in this world and even more amazing that you are preserving history
blessings to you and your passions
i think hiking trails are a great idea that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too especially once you get a good supply of water on tap then the town could serve as a base camp so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies
wow what an incredible journey exploring an abandoned ghost town your determination and enthusiasm for discovering hidden treasures like gold and water are truly inspiring the way you uncover the

demonslayer kimetsunoyaiba anime",2751,"this arc will be the calm before the storm
this arc is pretty cool but manga readers all know how legendary the next will be
edit i think there will be one more arc after the next or maybe just one big arc smushed together after this one
this is it guys where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc get yourself ready for whats coming next
this season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all 
im so excited for the hashira training arc  it really is the definition of calm before the storm
hell yeah manga readers all know whats going to come next the calm before the storm 
i can definitely see a lot of people not going like this arc due to the fact that it doesnt really have any great fighting sequence but i dont care the fact that this arc is the prime setup of one the greatest arcs in the entire series sends me shivers truly one of the calm before the storm moments

and for any manga readers reading this you know damn well that they are going to give us one of the biggest cliffhangers in the series if you know what i mean
demon slayer is absolutely a phenomenon to experience its been almost 5 years since the anime debuted and now after the the hashira training arc well be officially 1 arc away depending on how they animate the final one from completing the anime i remember watching the first episode only a few days after its release like it was just yesterday i never imagined it would become this big i cant wait to experience all of what kny has before it ends 
happy to see all the hashira in one frame 2025 to infinity arc
its crazy how big and popular demon slayer got in such a short amount of time
hyped for the new season
for manga readers out there what im most excited for is when mitsuri is gonna explain how she got the mark i love that scene and cant wait to see the other hashiras backstory animated
a final happiness for us ds fans coz people are not ready for the next infinity castle arc its really gonna break the internet 
i absolutely can not wait to see the arc after this get animated it will be a legendary arc and i get chills thinking about it
this arc is gonna be awesome and cant wait next year

i made this an in depth as possible to answer all of your questions hopefully i got them all which hero equipment will you be using for your strategy 

town hall 16 playlist httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistpletramf0nlxuvjlriv36ycaqna4vjyztm
heres the thing the new wall levels take 9m for a single piece but there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls 4 which can shoot over walls there is a jump and an earthquake spell 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
i actually like this change because for me the archer queens spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible
im a little concerned about the epic equipment especially if its tied to events it kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available
im suspicious of the epic equipment if they are only available from special events and much better than regular equipment theres potential balance issues
243 those ore numbers are spectacular
clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes thank you judo for always keeping us updated with juicy coc contents 
i think this is really cool but i am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level i really hope that levelling up your gear doesnt take ages and ages 

additionally i am very afraid of having epic gear thats limited i really hope that isnt something thats done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get anything limited atm is purely aesthetic and doesnt impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else i hope they keep that in mind
i hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking so you could startegize even further
for me this is just an amazing feature and something i would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops by that knowledge i think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that
the vampire mustache rage crystal and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if dps gets too high cant wait to try it out
great stuff as ever will you be doing an upgrade priority guide i know with most new th levels its the usual routine of th lab cc storages army camps etc but this feels very different and exciting eg with the blacksmith would love some guidance
i really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately for instance using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
its nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th1615 changes
thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation thanks
with the epic equipment for events as long as it doesnt require money to get i think will be such a good idea make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
this is so awesome its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new contentthese are gonna change the game a lot and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears

onepiece wano crunchyroll",1233,"im glad they showed off the seraphims introduction as a threat because it really set the tone of how strong they truly are
i like that blackbeard is a villain who shows concerns and vulnerabilities
he makes him more human and believable than the typical untouchable villains who seem to have everything under control like a god
i like how this shows an emperor can even have a hard time dealing with the new pacifista
after years of being told you arent ready for whats about to come i can confidently say yes i am indeed not ready
blackbeard is so unlikeable but thats also what makes him such a good villain i cant wait to see his rematch with luffy in the future 
i am a blackbeard stan the dude is hilarious powerful opportunistic and cowardly did you all get beaten by just one brat  pure comedy clearly the kid aint normal boss 
if this is what shawk can do imagine what mihawk can actually do
dude i still remember these chapters as if it was yesterday oda was straight cooking with hot grease
if the seraphims are modelled after the warlords it would be interesting to see teach fight a younger version of himself
you know its an abomination against nature because it has mihawks face but made an expression that wasnt a perma scowl or a delighted smirk
blackbeard is shown to be a bumbling drunk at times but that man knows his lore and history in the one piece verse unlike most characters he immediately picked up on the lunarian traits
i cannot stress enough how refreshing blackbeard is as a villain knowing that hes still exploring growing and making moves rather than just being a stagnant force like a lot of other op villains have been
considering that these new seraphimpacifistas have biological qualities to them it is likely that they are capable of getting stronger and learning from their previous fights as they age so if shawk was to fight blackbeard again it would be better equipped and adapted to deal with him  much like mahoraga from jjk
watch episode 1087 here httpsgotcrccop1087
reminder that blackbeards darkdark fruit makes all incoming attacks that hit him hurt more than it would any normal guy pretimeskip he wouldve been crying out in pain and reeling on the floor just goes to show that even against a seraphim blackbeard wasnt doing nothing for two years hes even more of a tank than ever
i really like how they made the seraphim completely silent really makes them feel otherworldly
blackbeard has levelled up dramatically he took on a slice that cut a mountain like butter then blocked the next attack with his haki all this in spite of his df amplifying the pain he feels
interesting enough to see blackbeard dodging and moving swiftly pre time skip he would usually be a sitting duck to most attacks
blackbeard calling him big is right on point if he is that size as a child and still developing imagine how enormous and deadly they would be as adults these pacifista are a potential threat for everyone not controlling them
love how blackbeard is portrayed here hes on the move and highly aware of his surroundings with quickly examining the new pacifistas the seraphim proved to be extremely powerful but blackbeard held his own the entire time and maintained control of the situation even whitebeard said he is always unprepared but thats how he rolls",1,Film & Animation,5410000,PT1M48S,"['glad they showed off the seraphims introduction threat because really set the tone how strong they truly are', 'like that blackbeard villain who show concern and vulnerability', 'make him more human and believable than the typical untouchable villain who seem have everything under control like god', 'like how this show emperor can even have hard time dealing with the new pacifista', 'after year being told you are not_ ready for what about come can confidently say yes indeed not_ ready', 'blackbeard unlikeable but that also what make him such good villain cannot wait see his rematch with luffy the future', 'blackbeard stan the dude hilarious powerful opportunistic and cowardly did you all get beaten just one brat pure comedy clearly the kid are not_ normal bos', 'this what shawk can imagine what mihawk can actually', 'dude still remember these chapter yesterday oda straight cooking with hot grease', 'the seraphims are modelled after the warlord would interesting see teach fight younger version himself', 'you know abomination against nature because mihawks face but made expression that not_ perma scowl delighted smirk', 'blackbeard shown bumbling drunk time but that man know his lore and history the one piece verse unlike most character immediately picked the lunarian trait', 'cannot stress enough how refreshing blackbeard villain knowing that still exploring growing and making move rather than just being stagnant force like lot other villain have been', 'considering that these new seraphimpacifistas have biological quality them likely that they are capable getting stronger and learning from their previous fight they age shawk fight blackbeard again would better equipped and adapted deal with him much like mahoraga from jjk', 'watch episode 1087 here', 'reminder that blackbeard darkdark fruit make all incoming attack that hit him hurt more than would any normal guy pretimeskip would have been cry out pain and reeling the floor just show that even against seraph blackbeard not_ doing nothing for two year even more tank than ever', 'really like how they made the seraph completely silent really make them feel otherworldly', 'blackbeard levelled dramatically took slice that cut mountain like butter then blocked the next attack with his haki all this spite his amplifying the pain feel', 'interesting enough see blackbeard dodging and moving swiftly pre time skip would usually sitting duck most attack', 'blackbeard calling him big right point that size child and still developing imagine how enormous and deadly they would adult these pacifista are potential threat for everyone not_ controlling them', 'love how blackbeard portrayed here the move and highly aware his surroundings with quickly examining the new pacifistas the seraph proved extremely powerful but blackbeard held his own the entire time and maintained control the situation even whitebeard said always unprepared but that how roll']",108

im not a fan of any of these actors but this trailer has driven me to watch the movie 
siddhant and adarsh are phenomenal actors no doubt and ananyas acting this time is also blending with their level great trailer  i hope movie would be also good
i think we can all agree that its an excel productions film and theres kalki it has won our hearts already no one can do movies of this genre better than the excel productions thank you guys for always giving us a film we deeply connect to
ananya is doing better day by day from student of the year to dream girl her acting skills are being better
this will be anannyas  second performance after dream girl 2 which will not  disappoint us
as siddhant chaturvedi continues to take on diverse roles his dedication to his craft is evident exciting to see what the future holds for this talented actor
seems like this movie is going to give a good message to our social media addicted generation 
hats off to ananya the sheer hate and negativity she receives for no reason i believe she is a real brave and strong person and also her movies choices are getting better best wishes
this cast just works i can feel the chemistry from my screen excited to watch it also can i just say ananya adarsh and sid look so good
this is going to be epic because it genuinely showed the reality of todays saddest generation 
why such movies doesnt have a theatrical release the trailer perfectly shows whats todays gen is going through and not focusing on what they should be
kudos to siddhant chaturvedi for bringing depth and authenticity to characters  looking forward to witnessing more of his incredible talent unfold on screen
in a world of constant change siddhant chaturvedi remains a beacon of authenticity his grounded demeanor and passion for his craft make him a standout in the film industry
 a love letter to us 
dont know how much this film would succeed with its timely and urgent exploration about us specifically this generation but this looks so promising to me the charming screen with all shades of ourselves reflecting is relatively relatable watching the cast like siddharth adarsh kalki etc im hopeful something stirringly will be served duly
adarash iss a phenomenal actorhim doing diverse roles like this is the reason i love him so much 
sid is solid too  seems like anaya might kill it too 
appreciating siddhant chaturvedis commitment to his craft  his dedication shines through in every scene
siddhants delivery of those intense dialogues is goosebump inducing
we needed this desperately thanks for creating something on this subject as always you cant miss siddhant or adarshs movies anyway

description from wikipedia poppy playtime chapter 1  a tight squeeze commonly known as chapter one or abbreviated as ch1 is the first chapter for poppy playtime it was released on october 13 on steam it revolves around the unamed player an exemployee of the toy manufacturing business playtime co whose employees when missing abruptly one day and receives a letter from an anonymous sender stating that were still here this incites the protagonist to go back to the abandoned factory and investigate it to find out what is happening playtime co is a toymaking company and the location where the game takes place it was likely established in the 1950s considering the aesthetic and lack of deeply advanced technology however the factory likely made its demise some time past the 80s depending in this game you play as an exemployee of a company labelled playtime co playtime co was once a corporate giant company that was in the toy manufacturing industry  that was until everybody inside the factory went missing now years later you return to the factory to investigate these unknown missing cases one of the main mascots of playtime co he was one of the best sellers and found a place in the hearts of many children across the globe due to the fact that he was programmed to hug people or because he was found to be cute nobody really knows what made him so appealing however due to experimentation on the toys at playtime co a huggy wuggy seems to have come to life and gone rogue killing everyone that crosses its path the player is the main protagonist of poppys playtime and is the person you currently play as during chapter 1 a tight squeeze there is not much to say about the player since we never get an introduction to who they could be however theres a recurring theory that the live toys such as the murderous hh were actually human experiments theres a theory that the player has ties to whoever was running the operation or looked similar to them which is why they were so ferociously attacked this is not canon and this may be disputed later on as more lore is revealed poppy playtime is a minor character inside chapter 1 and will most likely be an important character for the upcoming chapters poppy is a highly intelligent toy she has the ability to properly converse with a child shes also programmed to talk and communicate like a real little girl her first debut is in chapter 1 and is featured inside the first vhs tape the player receives in the game in which she appears in her own commercial tape the grab pack was shown to have been used by factory workers to do heavy lifting and general tasks that would have been hard for the average man to do alone or even in groups not to mention that in the chase scene the player used it to pull a huge box over an entrance to deter a murderous huggy wuggy and instead destroys the entire mesh floor with the box and takes huggy wuggy down with it this shows that its incredibly powerful managing to pull down a box like that with ease in vhs 2 its also shown that it can easily decapitate a person with relative ease in vhs 2 because of this it was strongly advised to use these with care for that very reason decapitating your coworker is not ideal steam page you must stay alive in this horrorpuzzle adventure try to survive the vengeful toys waiting for you in the abandoned toy factory use your grabpack to hack electrical circuits or nab anything from afar explore the mysterious facility and dont get caught",794,"id say this is a good decision for mob games to delay chapter 3 i wouldnt want this to be an unstable broken mess
im just glad mob games are focusing on quality over quanity and me personally they can take their time because the trailer is amazing and really shows that theyre putting good effort into making this amazing game they have stood their ground against other mascot horror games and its great to see them actually putting in the work to make the fans happy mob games have really redeemed themselfs
the graphics on this trailer is actually insane i dont care if i have to wait another year this chapter will be amazing
to me chapter 3 being delayed is way better than it being released earlyon not only if it was released early it would have alot of bugs but its also afterchristmas so most kids including me 3 will get some christmas money as a gift that i personally will buy chapter 3 with if i get it
i love the new area  the painted walls and artificial ceiling projecting the night sky is very cool and very creepy with how playtimes trying to simulate real life for the kids

i think the character hanging in the cell is the bunny personally but maybe its the dog 

its easy to forget we didnt go back to the factory for the kids but for the staff  with the talk of these children grow hungry im starting to think the children whether in the right or wrong are now the main antagonists of the story
the trailer only came out 12 minutes ago jeez this man can work fast
man if you compare this to the ch2 trailer it is 10 times better in everything graphics lore and general vibe is so amazing thats definetly much more than i expected
it would be interesting if cat naps eyes were sensitive to light instead of only using a flashlight for dark areas maybe we can also use it to keep catnap further away from us  one can imagine that a creature whose eyes are used to the dark would have difficulties with readjusting their vision when exposed to a bright light
definitely sad about the delay but the gameplay trailer definitely compensated this alot so excited to see though im glad ill be just watching people play this dog characther looks terrifying xd
its really disappointing that the chapter is delayed especially after they confirmed its release this year multiple times but im sure went the game release it will be worth it
907 i believe this is mostly referring to the employees since after poppy says that she says the ones who tortured us i believe that mostly clearly means she is referring to the employees or maybe even the head scientists
theory because dogday is a heretic and was thrown in jail i believe that the reason hes chasing after us is because he spent so insanely long in there that he needs to prove hes not a heretic by killing an actual heretic and adding it to the shrine thing also hes gotta tend to his hungry needs
i j realized i said the mailbox was boxy boo lmao my bad it looked like him xd
sometimes it does suck when stuff our delayed but they made a good decision in my opinion

the game looks really amazing i cant wait to see when it gets released
something that i hope is added is boss fights seems random to add into the game half way presumably but batim put bosses that are mandatory into chapter 4 while dark deception put bosses into chapter 3 onwards
the room in wich the player puts on their gas mask to go in the red gas looks like the room we find poppy in for the first time in her case
im so excited for chapter three im not really scared of poppy playtime or other indie horror but this genuinely sent a chill up my spine at first when i watched the trailer i thought that dog day who was tied up in this plush playground area prison for heretics was buggy wuggy i hope we get to see huggy maybe help us along with poppy and kissy to take down 1006
i hope the team takes rest after finishing chapter 3 they deserve it if you are mad about delay mob has been working a lot
i have so much respect for them for giving us a proper apology that im not even disappointed about the delay tbh

ojgaming supercellpartner",847,"supercell has officially lost it
i cant wait for the day you can turn your king tower into an eagle artillery
i cant wait to spend all of my familys savings on maxing out tower troops
to be honest the new cannon troop looks powerful against tanks but its going to get annihilated by cycle swarm bait gy decks if it really has a 22 second attack speed those are some free goblin barrels its probably gonna be costly to level up but it doesnt seem advantageous to me just feels more rockpaperscissors if anything
cant wait to start hoarding troop cards to level up my princess towers one level in every three years i wonder what else fun they are going to do in future years maybe make the king a card and make us pay even more
tower troops seem like a really bad idea since this would counter win conditions at random and make matchmaking even more luck based for example if they add a splash damage tower troop skeleton barrel perishes on the spot
the warmth challenge is one of the most interesting challenge ive seen
every card feels balanced around how much damage spells the princess towers and defensive buildings do to them the moment any one of those aspects are changed heavily the meta will definitely be torn from the ground up into something new
supershell never fails to disappoint 
i cant believe we gotta now pay to upgrade our towers 
what is supercell thinking
i like how oj deeply analyzes the troop tower video when he can justo wait for the oficial video in a few weeks algo great description of the warmth spell 
the warmth cardsnowstorm is a brilliant idea ive always felt like there should be something in each arena to make each of them unique rain doesnt count
i just noticed that the warmth spell is able to heal crown towers
cant wait to use this to chesse close match overtime 
honestly oj analysing the frames is actually really helpful
warmth spells heal princess towers and probably king towers aswell i also cant wait for evolved firecracker on the princess tower
actually magic archer is quite op in this challenge because if your opponent keep stacking things you can use the 

power of geometry
introducing the warmth spell really makes me think that you can possible make a puzzle level with it having already frozen troops on your and the opponents side this would honestly only be possible if there were like an evolved mirror where i used the card on both sides

corvette v8 awd",862,"this car deserved to be in the main channel
james wit and observation skills is faster than a z06 coming up with that cor vette joke and observing the  synchronous clap in real time is crazy sharp always fun listening to these 2
i think they did a perfect job electrifying the corvette even with all the downsides i would 100 buy the zo6 but as a hybrid stingray its pretty good
thomas and james give us more info in 11 minutes than normal people do in an hour and funnier
its a corolla in the front and a vette in the back put it together its a corvette then thomass late reaction amazing video guys
the difference between this and a z06 is the same between a 911 turbo s and a gt3 rs very similar price tag completely different use and customer target
i really love how the cockpit and interior looks it legit covers you in with all kinds of buttons and screens pointing towards you making it feel like a spaceship they do interior better than most other supercars
who the hell is editing a extra throttle house upload   seriously guys  i love both of your channels  you make me laugh amd giggle everytime besides the wonderful production quality
cheers from vienna  austria boys  keep up the fantastic work
the editor for the definition of hybrid bit had me rolling thanks for the work all of your employees do to continue to bring these videos to the masses and for giving me something to watch while i eat my mcdonalds in the morning
back in the 1970s there was a british car called the austin allegro which objectively a terrible car but it had a quartic steering wheel which was so roundly mocked by the press and public that they changed it to a round one 50 years later and the squared off wheel is everywhere
that corolla in the front and vette in the back joke was incredible well done
the fact that this video is extra throttle house and not even a real produced and scripted video is so impressive
listening to them talking about this feels so natural just good
i had not even considered this to be the chevy nsx type s but youre exactly right  now i want honda to build the acura z06
james comical wit is pro level and thomas enjoyment of said wit makes the whole thing so fun to watch
that sounds like a good place to conclu
top tier editing
regardless of the rest of the car i absolutely love the wheel design  reminds me of ferraris from 1520 years ago
the benefit of the eray over the z06 would be probably more obvious on a wet road than in these perfect conditions great review
the content is gold they answer all the questions id ask the ones i should have thought of and they leave me in stitches with these jokes  best automotive showchannel on yt right now
i love what theyve done with this but id still take a z06 every day and twice on sundays  that fpc is just too good
would love to see a full throttle house review of this car im number one on my dealers list and the biggest reason im choosing this over a z06 is simply because an z06 is impossible to get here ive been patiently awaiting your review of the eray this just feels like a tease lol ",22,People & Blogs,264000,PT11M27S,"['this car deserved the main channel', 'james wit and observation skill faster than z06 coming with that cor vette joke and observing the synchronous clap real time crazy sharp always fun listening these', 'think they did perfect job electrifying the corvette even with all the downside would 100 buy the zo6 but hybrid stingray pretty good', 'thomas and james give more info minute than normal people hour and funnier', 'corolla the front and vette the back put together corvette then thomas late reaction amazing video guy', 'the difference between this and z06 the same between 911 turbo and gt3 very similar price tag completely different use and customer target', 'really love how the cockpit and interior look legit cover you with all kind button and screen pointing towards you making feel like spaceship they interior better than most other supercars', 'who the hell editing extra throttle house upload seriously guy love both your channel you make laugh amd giggle everytime besides the wonderful production quality', 'cheer from vienna austria boy keep the fantastic work', 'the editor for the definition hybrid bit had rolling thanks for the work all your employee continue bring these video the mass and for giving something watch while eat mcdonalds the morning', 'back the 1970s there british car called the austin allegro which objectively terrible car but had quartic steering wheel which roundly mocked the press and public that they changed round one year later and the squared off wheel everywhere', 'that corolla the front and vette the back joke incredible well done', 'the fact that this video extra throttle house and not_ even real produced and scripted video impressive', 'listening them talking about this feel natural just good', 'had not_ even considered this the chevy nsx type but you are exactly right now want honda build the acura z06', 'james comical wit pro level and thomas enjoyment said wit make the whole thing fun watch', 'that sound like good place conclu', 'top tier editing', 'regardless the rest the car absolutely love the wheel design reminds ferraris from 1520 year ago', 'the benefit the eray over the z06 would probably more obvious wet road than these perfect condition great review', 'the content gold they answer all the question ask the one should have thought and they leave stitch with these joke best automotive showchannel right now', 'love what they have done with this but still take z06 every day and twice sunday that fpc just too good', 'would love see full throttle house review this car number one dealer list and the biggest reason choosing this over z06 simply because z06 impossible get here have been patiently awaiting your review the eray this just feel like tease lol']",687

cookd out now  httpscookdstore",3468,"i did not sleep since lego came out so i could film and edit this and its still only 9 minutes 
other streamers crying when friends blow up their house 

lazar builds his own house just to blow it up
the fact that the lego mode came out 2 days ago proves that lazar can make videos in that time frame

weve caught him
the fact that lannan is happy and healthy enough to do uploads so quickly really brings me joy really gives early lazar vibes
i find it hilarous that lazar can screw around with literally anything his heart desires
hands down one of the best gamemodes weve gotten
always gonna be a good day when lazar uploads 
lazar never fails to break any game within 12 hours of its release
poor ceeday getting roasted 
lazar being this consistent feels unreal
its truly legendary that lazar is still using the gingerbread skin despite there being a literal skin of him
your creativity in this lego fortnite video is off the charts just like the designs in ytgw0010 truly inspiring work
so cool thing about these golems is that theyre not actually desertspecific either that or they change colour according to whichever biome theyre in
lazar complaning about ceeday not uploading with his upload schedule is criminal
the difference in the amount of time that lazarbeam streamed and the and the amount of time this video is just proves how much he cares about us to be entertained
lazar always finds a way to break every game in existence
i have to say this but this felt like an old lazarbeam video i love just the goofy ideas and music it makes me happy to see this kind of content again thanks lannan
lazar will never fail to attempt to break everything he finds even mullys collarbone

sonny played perfectly today congrats on having double digit goals for 8 consecutive seasons sonny
this is how our wingers supposed to play just like todays winger son
absolutely quality assists from son legend
son is what most clubs need from their forwards he creates fluidity and chances for everyone in the attack and works hard to position himself to score what a guy 
congratulations tottenham  i love this team
son assisted as a winger and scored as a striker in one game what a master class
as a liverpool fan but also congratulates tottenham son had an excellent match playing as a left wing striker with 1 goal  2 assists what a legend what a match
2 assists and 1 goal accomplishment of double digit goals in this season which means 8 consecutive seasons nice one sonny
no quality providers for son as a striker so son falls back and provides for others to score 
spurs always lacked that quality and thats why kane and son were the main providers and goal scorers for each other
their record is something but that also tells about the team as well
sonnys responsible for 3 goals today just amazing hell be missed so much when hes gone so much fun to see him play
son was there in every goals outstanding
sonny was a young player who always shed tears when his team was defeated in a crucial moment while playing in korea in his 20s now in his 30s he is leading the team as a captain and doing his best to make sure young players dont feel what he has been through he is one of seven players in premier league history to score double figures for eight consecutive seasons
whether he is a winger or a striker sonny is an irreplaceable player
sons dribbling is just incredible
son what a player what a legend
sonny is a living legendamazing
sonny is also a player who can play a role in penetrating the teams blocked blood vesselssonnys key pass is fantasticcongratulations on sonys doubledigit goal for the eighth consecutive season

brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
por primera vez estoy muy emocionada por la actualizacin pero en serio me siento mal por que ya no podr conseguir el brawl pass con gemas  pero al menos se compensa un poco con la mejora que le pusieron a las recompensas gratis
an as gracias supercell
the star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past the fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all
0 ameeei demais  quanta atualizao  ansiosa
eu amei o visual brasileiro da piper vlw supercell inclusive acho melhor  o 5v5 do futebrawl
240 si se dieron cuenta aparece el acceso anticipado de kit y por eso aparece que se puede comprar con oro
ojal y agregen mas recompensas a en la cuestion del nivel de experiencia ya que es algo que esta olvidado en el juego desde siempre y estoy seguro que muchos ni saben de eso solo se han enfocado en el camino de trofeos
when will the new warrior kit arrive
essa atualizao t incrvel s que eu no estou conseguindo a sequncia de vitrias ontem eu estava conseguindo mais hoje no
hola supercell tena unas cuantas preguntas  les agradecera si pudieran aclarrmelas  un saludo y gracias 
para la gente que ya hayamos conseguido las 50000 copas no hay stardrops legendarios   la recompensa antigua era mucho peor a la de ahora

the amount of dedication they put in this is more i could put in anything
why does dev always get the most infuriating challenges 
you know its gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
dev started as a hunter and when he got detached he still decided to be speed runner xd
i would love to try some of these challenges myself they seem fun but my computer can barely handle running minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting never mind multiplayer high paced pvp related stuff also i cant speedrun so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this
i love how intense this video was and then the end was the most anticlimactic thing ever
it was supposed to be fun like friends work together actually kinda hit me in the feels feels bad man
kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isnt a bad twist imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
you know id love to see a manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking ie trading doesnt give pearls enderman only spawn in the overworld waterlava source gives cobble and have dev be the speedrunner maybe then hed be kiers speed 3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions in a good way of course

alan deserves an oscar award
the cowboy hat was clever at first i thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until i realized it also was there to contextualize tscs rotational position in 3d space since otherwise we wouldnt be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape which most of them were
if you could turn this format into a video game youd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics
please never stop doing these biology chemistry logic history anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation thank you
for a spiritual seeker physics student this is emotional
as a physics student i can say that this is amazing i see were going for an interstellar interpretation of singularities which is cool to see as well
alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
this was absolutely stunning to watch i cant wait to see what comes next

maybe an animation vs chemistry 

chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts
genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts its like a whole season of bill nye compressed to the size of a single episode you would make an excellent teacher
one of the most relaxing videos i have ever seen proud to say i learned something from this and glad to know i get to exist at the same time as this all the work youve done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given
as a guy who loves physics i absolutely love this from classical mechanics to general relativity then quantum mechanics alan and his team are do amazing job at this
absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation i absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works keep up it up you and your team are absolutely amazing
woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown just like in math physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity acceleration friction gravity and many more i honestly love how you visualize every details that some people dont know which is crazy i remember learning physics during my high school years until college i know that it sounds really difficult to understand but im sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics thank you so much alan becker and the whole team for making this animation i hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals 
im loving these new new animations  there is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time

amazing job and i cant wait to see whats next
as a civil engineering major junior this and animation vs math have brought me to tears both of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why im still passionate about what im studying thank you 3
this is one of the most impressive things ive seen on youtube in a while respect to the team behind it
this is by far my favorite animation on this channel its so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully you deserve a damn oscar for this
spectacular animation as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that ive learned and for the ones that i have yet to learn it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is and why it is being used in the manner that it is one particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg im sure they were so happy that he joined them soooo adorable
ryan risked losing his apple watch just to test a review mad respect
the fact that ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane
i was cracking up from start to finish thanks man i needed that 
i always worry about content creators ettiquette when theyre recording in public it fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers 
i went on the harry potter ride many times but this one time i did actually get stuck for a few minutes the people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so i could go on again without waiting i have to say it was worth it 
watching ryan and his dad have fun at the place theyve talked about going together for so long is really heartwarming 3
as someone whos been to universal studios once and loved every second of it i was shocked to learn it had such a low review score i guess the waiting just doesnt bother me that much since im already used to disneyland waiting time
i dont know why but asking the kid if she knew janelle made me laugh so hard and then you saying she is upset and the kid going oh comedy gold
ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist 
i love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh 
universal studios is very popular so there is a reason why its so packed and that the lines are so long there really isnt anything the workers can do to change that the main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line some lines are kinda crazy of course there are a few rides in the harry potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties the ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride whenever ive gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
ryan trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content he took this to an absolute infinity win
i agree with mark we got stuck on the harry potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out i was scared and didnt know anybody else on the same coaster so i just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere
i watch your videos on regular days but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better thank you ryan
ryan never fails to make me smile

hopescope on tiktok for some laughs",3064,"does this mean were getting an i bought every american girl doll video because i would definitely watch that
i find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because i still see them every year
we loved having you and your team out to the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with us hope
as an american girl doll collector you did amazing at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls im so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again
as a professional baker ive made a barbie cake like that before a few tips for the next time wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in less mess that way also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 
love how you called the newer polly pockets clothes chewy 
i could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game i would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood
hey hope that polly was original but the castle is actually a star castle i had that exact one equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely its own vibe 
as a kid i had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what i was working toward after months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house she was finally mine 
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday so i was surprised to see them in here lol
i had the tiny polly pockets and rollerblading kira she was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything the essence of 1991 i had no idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like a lighter lol 
i wanted a samantha doll more than anything as a kid her books were the reason i started to love to read 
i love seeing how far hope has come i remember watching yall her videos in order and i would get sooo excited when i got a notification saying she posted and i still get as excitedi wish you good luck on reaching 4m
i was 30 in 2004 but the mary kate  ashley game still got me the graphics were crazy lol i remember my children wanting some of these items lol thanks hope
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
actually loving all the background changes in this video  it made it much more animated and fun
i legit had that rollerblade barbie she was my favorite i also think ag dolls were better overall quality when pleasant company was still in control the most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing everything was so true to life with little clasps and now its all cheap velcro but for the same price  also the dolls were made in germany back then  not china
i wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious  i love seeing childhood products i never got to have if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
for the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones you can find them at target it made me so happy to see 
my daughter actually loves polly pockets they make them in different varieties now there are ones with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge bodies and others with plasticsilicone forms called micro polly thats the small compact versions ",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S,"['doe this mean were getting bought every american girl doll video because would definitely watch that', 'find strange that the monster cereal were apparently discontinued because still see them every year', 'loved having you and your team out the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with hope', 'american girl doll collector you did amazing pointing out the difference between the era doll happy see many people finding their love for these doll again', 'professional baker have made barbie cake like that before few tip for the next time wrap the lower half your doll plastic wrap before you stick her mess that way also stick her before you decorate the cake that way the bodice the dress match the skirt', 'love how you called the newer polly pocket clothes chewy', 'could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game would definitely watch live you playing relive childhood', 'hey hope that polly original but the castle actually star castle had that exact one equally cute and nostalgic but definitely own vibe', 'kid had chore chart with picture that 2000s samantha doll taped reminder what working toward after month and month getting few buck week for doing job around the house she finally mine', 'the monster cereal were fully stocked target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday surprised see them here lol', 'had the tiny polly pocket and rollerblading kira she hip and the little fanny pack everything the essence 1991 had idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like lighter lol', 'wanted samantha doll more than anything kid her book were the reason started love read', 'love seeing how far hope come remember watching you all her video order and would get sooo excited when got notification saying she posted and still get excitedi wish you good luck reaching', '2004 but the mary kate ashley game still got the graphic were crazy lol remember child wanting some these item lol thanks hope', 'hope amazing she put much time work and money into these video just grateful for her', 'actually loving all the background change this video made much more animated and fun', 'legit had that rollerblade barbie she favorite also think doll were better overall quality when pleasant company still control the most noticeable detail were the doll clothing everything true life with little clasp and now all cheap velcro but for the same price also the doll were made germany back then not_ china', 'wish there hour this content scrumptious love seeing childhood product never got have you ever want make this video longer wed watch queen', 'for the polly pocket they brought back the 2000s one you can find them target made happy see', 'daughter actually love polly pocket they make them different variety now there are one with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge body and others with plasticsilicone form called micro polly that the small compact version']",1182

i think the attack speed getting reduced on charlie was the icing on the cake because in reality none of the other nerfs mattered if she can still spam her main attack
the amount of effort you put in behind the scenes to get us the data is awesome and underrated
honestly we really need an olympics again it would be cool to just see where every brawler is with all of the olympics kairos has made
the amount of joy i felt while hearing all the nerf to charlie was like waking up to gifts under the christmas tree  
subscribe for mico kit  larry sneak peeks
5v5 looks insanely fun its the mode ive been looking forward to the most
i noticed that when you were testing lous super charge rate on the before side lou had his epic supercharge gear equipped i think this could have affected the outcome but idk
lets all thank kairos for putting so much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peaks
0002 update includes progression buffs for freetoplay players and new balance changes
0153 edgars hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed
0519 several brawlers are receiving significant buffs to their attack damage and health
0712 buffs and nerfs to various brawlers
1043 brawl stars update brings changes to game modes and introduces optional ingame ads
1232 brawl pass system changes and updates
1605 new system brings significant buffs for freetoplay players
1734 freetoplay players getting a 132 buff to coins
2044 the new brawl pass offers more gems free credits and extra perks
2222 brawl pass plus offers 96 more coins 79 more power points and exclusive perks
2535 chroma credits will be converted to regular credits affecting the cost of buying chromatic brawlers
2719 new skins showcase and details
3056 new skins and animations for different brawlers
3244 new skins and upgrades coming in the update
every time this man uploads i think of how much work he actually puts into this the math and everything
3254 it really looks like hes firing power points with his main attack and i also love the fact that cil turned into a starr drop
i love the direction this game has been going as a whole but as a long term player i hope down the road they make a prestige progression system with exclusive rewards down the road i hope this game never dies i always look forward to the brawl talks and podcasts im so happy there only monthly seasons now
i feel like charlie  will never be under b or c tier even after the nerfs her super is still pretty easy to charge and the fact its a 5 second stun since ppl rarely seem to help get their teammates out of the cocoon anyway is still very good her dps on long range will probably be almost the same her attack is still pretty fast and easy to hit but i do like the fact shes not a must pick anymore
love to see my favourite ever mobile game get such a good update and such regular updates they are always trying new things and adding stuff
thanks for always making excellent and informative content 
i think the most oppressive part about charlie was honestly her projectile speed it is incredibly easy to land shots and hard to dodge and since she doesnt have normal ammo this means she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge i do think her super should be straight up reworked but thats a different topic nerfing the spiders and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though
kudos to kairos for making this video
what a huge amount of content you have to cover
im super excited for that mortis buff mortis has been and is still my favorite character in the game and this simply means that hes going to be able to get that extra healing off 50 quicker which if hes in a big bundle of enemies then hes just gonna be able to heal that much quicker
i do really appreciate how kairos does these videos and how he makes calculations for everyone so they can see how the value of their money translates but when he talks on buying every brawl pass in the old system i feel we should consider even most paying players but every other pass with gems so his stats for that seem a little off to me personally",20,Gaming,1050000,PT34M22S,"['crow going take out the bos fast with the new hypercharge', 'think the attack speed getting reduced charlie the icing the cake because reality none the other nerfs mattered she can still spam her main attack', 'the amount effort you put behind the scene get the data awesome and underrated', 'honestly really need olympics again would cool just see where every brawler with all the olympics kairos made', 'the amount joy felt while hearing all the nerf charlie like waking gift under the christmas tree', 'subscribe for mico kit larry sneak peek', '5v5 look insanely fun the mode have been looking forward the most', 'noticed that when you were testing lous super charge rate the before side lou had his epic supercharge gear equipped think this could have affected the outcome but not_ know', 'let all thank kairos for putting much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peak', '0002 update includes progression buff for freetoplay player and new balance change', '0153 edgar hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed', '0519 several brawler are receiving significant buff their attack damage and health', '0712 buff and nerfs various brawler', '1043 brawl star update brings change game mode and introduces optional ingame', '1232 brawl pas system change and update', '1605 new system brings significant buff for freetoplay player', '1734 freetoplay player getting 132 buff coin', '2044 the new brawl pas offer more gem free credit and extra perk', '2222 brawl pas plus offer more coin more power point and exclusive perk', '2535 chroma credit will converted regular credit affecting the cost buying chromatic brawler', '2719 new skin showcase and detail', '3056 new skin and animation for different brawler', '3244 new skin and upgrade coming the update', 'every time this man uploads think how much work actually put into this the math and everything', '3254 really look like firing power point with his main attack and also love the fact that cil turned into starr drop', 'love the direction this game been going whole but long term player hope down the road they make prestige progression system with exclusive reward down the road hope this game never always look forward the brawl talk and podcasts happy there only monthly season now', 'feel like charlie will never under tier even after the nerfs her super still pretty easy charge and the fact second stun since people rarely seem help get their teammate out the cocoon anyway still very good her long range will probably almost the same her attack still pretty fast and easy hit but like the fact she not_ must pick anymore', 'love see favourite ever mobile game get such good update and such regular update they are always trying new thing and adding stuff', 'thanks for always making excellent and informative content', 'think the most oppressive part about charlie honestly her projectile speed incredibly easy land shot and hard dodge and since she doe not_ have normal ammo this mean she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge think her super should straight reworked but that different topic nerfing the spider and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though', 'kudos kairos for making this video', 'what huge amount content you have cover', 'super excited for that mortis buff mortis been and still favorite character the game and this simply mean that going able get that extra healing off quicker which big bundle enemy then just going able heal that much quicker', 'really appreciate how kairos doe these video and how make calculation for everyone they can see how the value their money translates but when talk buying every brawl pas the old system feel should consider even most paying player but every other pas with gem his stats for that seem little off personally']",2062

were jason and nikki wynn  a couple of modernday documentarians perpetual travelers and seekers of tall tales  

weve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011 why  because curiosity is the key to unlocking life  it pushes us outside our comfort zone softens our assumptions and helps us embrace the great unknown  the more we let our curiosity lead the way the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us

our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land  selfreliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must  its all about managing our resources and were always looking for new and better ways to do so  

weve lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a van to rv to a sailboat and over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy creating safe drinking water and managing our waste

our journey is everevolving but the mission remains the same cultivatecuriosity

its a process you wouldnt want any other way but to be right  enjoy the journey  hugs for overcoming the challenges 
this is fantastic its about time  good people deserve good things
dear jason and nikki congrats on this most crucial of all milestones perfect flotation she looks stunning i hear your frustration and sense your months of inner exhaustion from anticipating her birth and yet despite your readiness shes gonna be born when she is ready not when anyone else is ready but thats the beauty of it it will all cone true and all be worth it meanwhile luckily you two are incredibly practiced at unpredictable waiting its one of your superpowers youre just stuck in the worlds most unpredictable weather window right now waiting to depart but the weather keeps changing and its all out of your control may you draw on your inner strength its expectation  the set up and the disappointment  that makes it so emotionally exhausting to you for us were just here for the ride and were not going anywhere so please dont worry about pleasing anyone other than yourselves may you just do what you need to do to take care of you sending support and all the positive energy from across the world lee
we started with travel trailers and are now building a boat pretty much because of you guys we took your advice to heart and have learned to sail and are building up our miles and skills before we pick up our own boat great to see how this whole process is unfolding took last weeks break as an opportunity to go back and watch your first couple of months of sailing videos how far you have come
limbo living is always such a challenge  ive experienced it a few times in my 77 years and i now know it was a teachinglearning time for me i admire the way you two are handling it all with such grace and putting it to good use so very eager to see the next step ive been following you since your very early rv days and its always been a joy peace to you both 
i noticed no props or bottom paint so then realized the process is ongoing i was able to watch the commissioning of our new monohull sailboat back in the day a very interesting and exciting process indeed congratulations and glad to see they are making sure everything is done correctly
love all your videos this build has been an adventure to watch can just imagine what your adventure feels like as to ebikes im a private pilot and have a few pilot friends that have ebikes they ftake on their aircraft so lightweight foldable relatively small package when folded durable etc theyve recommended stark drive montague me1 and brompton ebikes not sure if any fit your specsneeds but may be worth at least a look
your episodes never fail to leave us with anticipation of the next one fascinating process i was intrigued by the stepp ed process of checking systems and installing panels in a particular and necessary order thanks for the invitation looking forward to the next video be well niki and jason real close to sailing this jewel on your owncant wait for those episodes
im sure i can speak for many of your fans in saying we love you i understand it can be hard large life events going not quite so perfectly ive gone through some similar things building a barn but i know the wait is going to be worth it youll be so happy were all here to support the both of you as you follow your dreams through the good the bad and the delayed i know it can be hard but keep keeping your heads up you should be proud
im so excited for you and can also feel and see your disappointment on yet more delays thank you for showing us the reality and some of the emotion behind all of this im eagerly awaiting next weeks episode thank you for taking us on this journey with you
it is all just a part of the journey of building our own boat the more you are there the more you learn and the better you will know your own boat thanks for letting us be a part of your lives
congratulations on getting the boat in the water for the first time that was so exciting
you two are so down to earth in contrast with your shiny new yacht its a beautiful thing we need more stories about reasonable people making it 
you guys are awesome  its amazing the time and thought you put in to making great videos  keep up the great work
sorry that youve had so many things to challenge your happiness but great job of presenting the realities of this process  looking forward to seeing yall on board and testing everything out ahead of your future great adventures

kurtisconner",7115,"when i see a new kurtis upload i jump up and down and squeal like a little pig
thinking wed actually get a barbie analysis from kurtis was too good to be true
i understand the trilogy has come to an end but a bonus round comparing barbie video games to bratz video games is kind of warranted
thank you so much to the pokmon company international for sponsoring todays video click the link here to download pokmon unite

httpsbitlyholidaykurtisconner
i loved that kurtis reverted back to poc women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt poc women an ally through and through
how dare thee call me a wizard has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
i dont think im ready for the barbie vs bratz series to end
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i havent skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a barbie girl from childhood to now i am praying for a new andor remake of the bratz liveaction barbie was phenomenal for what it was imagine what we could have with bratz and to add we need a better monster high liveaction i said what i said
so glad the microchips line thats been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved lifesized as much as many of us did
congratulations on being sponsored by pokmon so proud and happy for you
as a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with bratz
glad the you dont have a daddy or a bankaccount line got the recognition it deserves been on my mind for years 
as a hispanic person yasmins part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
you should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more please and thanks target audience reached
idc how bad the bratz live action is it will always be part of my core memories

bloxfruits  roblox gamerrobot gaming",38802,"kitsune beautiful 
the sounds effects are so satisfying
theres something ive dreamed of seeing in blox since i started playing collision between attacks being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible using the ice x to stop attacks for example this would definitely change the blox combat style as well as making it more complex and in my opinion interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful
i personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island i think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled tree top
the z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender x move is lookin like the best combo starter fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer f is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage base

mode
riding is ultimate furry half joking lol
z move looks alot better fits the transformation
x move is honestly worse than non mode x range is way to short and can only be used as an extender but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
c move is practically the same just more aoe and probably damage
f move is just a slightly better version of itself not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

opinion is leopard better yes and no leopard is more spammy than kitsune but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

bonus fox lamp
z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it 
x tap good extender with seemingly good damage
xhold imo worse than tap x but better for aoe

is it better than the best sword aka cdk no it has potential but cdk has more combo potential and most likely more damage

i wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol
timestamps please pin this as it helps many people

kitsune fruitmythical
value higher than leoas showed on twitter



timestamps 
showcase 226
z move accursed enchantment 244
x move tails of burning agony 307
c move foxfire disruption 334
f move swift assault 403


v transform 440
when allied with someone they can ride the saddle on the kitsune
transform z 424
transform x 620
transform c 656
transform f 740

passive 805 you can run on water after transforming


fox lamp weapon

z move scorching azure 842
x move infernal firestorm 914
both moves can be held for more damage
the devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
i wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless i do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
most visually pleasing fruit imo hope for more much better updates to come been playing this quite a while and although i hate grind games this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games ive ever played
moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations i am looking forward to using this fruit in the future
this seems to be a good antiteamer fruit flashy incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others plus i see amazing combo potential with kitsune and fox lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
i started playing blox fruits a while back and blox fruits has really stepped up their game they have recently come out with update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new max level this new max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play they also definetly know what they are doing they always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often this update 20 came out somewhat around the time of one piece live action which means that when players watch one piece live action they might understand more about blox fruits and want to play well done blox fruits 
i think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon i hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion
i love this fruit and all the mechanics the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers cant wait for the dragon and control rework

it would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragons moves just to see if they are worth buying
055
lets just appreciate how much a lot of time gamer robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day huge respect  
when transforming like a fox maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler
maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work
i think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run  skycamp with tbh

httpshareepidemicsoundcomphdft",5831,"ive never seen someone buy so many items at a japanese electronic store you must have broken a record 
thanks for having me along for the day man was a lot of fun
hope youve got some snacks ready  this is the longest video weve ever made  which countrys tech do you want us to test next
looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in japan next time round how about scoping out some everyday gizmos would love to see how japans hometech game stacks up against ours
your one of my favorite youtubers arun you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
fun fact there was actually another company in japan called logitec its spelled the same as logitech in japanese and they were in japan before logitech was able to open up anything in japan so they had to change their name to logicool in japan only to avoid a name conflict
this is so surreal ive been letting the abroad in japan channel build up videos to binge and after the frozen frontier series i went back to another video from arun to finish it and i was like oh yeah theres a new video i wanna watch that and now seeing chris walk in was like

the only way i can express the feeling was imagine you watch a tv show and then switch to another tv show only to see the character from the other tv show nonchalantly walk in like what
that trackball mouse is something i used at my job back in the late 80s early 90s youve never seen one before 
this was a great collab  love to watch both yours and chriss channels 
that store completely blows my mind i could be in there for days
love the longer video btw this was enjoyable to watch
i might be one of the few japanese subscribers of your channel your videos are awesome and i genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho hope youll come back soon
i think i can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food genuinely amazing
the timing of those memes is just chefs kiss
i love how excited arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol
the ball mouse is called a trackball pretty useful especially helping reduce rsi its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it also for fine control you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate
3920 first time in japan over twenty years ago taught me that rice is not a bulk up  filler  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion  its a hard sell to a lot of westerners   
but  its my occasional once or twice a year life mission
im a japanese in the uk and i really enjoyed this  shame the kids watch wont work in the uk with child safety more of an issue here than in japan it would probably do relatively well here  i love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years  yum asia do good ones in the uk and not as expensive as the japanese leader but similar technology i didnt see it in the video and i know its not a cooking channel but i hope you washed the rice first 
its my dream to go to japan definitely visiting this tech place when i eventually go 
touch ball mice are used a lot in north america canada more then usa they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as autocad maya blender and image creation such as krita photoshop etc they work very well for a lot of things even gaming i loved mine but the ball has a small accident exactly like the one you had when you picked it up my sister and i nicked named the ball  booots its a joke from baldurs gate 2 with the gigantic minatare space hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling no boots as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over its done and now you are sad i would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion when it fits right you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life so you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how boots died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident after that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality 
final thing there are some that use 24 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3d environment such as 123d autocad and others but it also makes games such as mmorpgs fps and rts a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots especially the multiple sensor ones

so find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the dpi you want and never look back that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments
i love coverage like this id love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device for example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s a portable record player was one of my first repairs id be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then i suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts or vinyl enthusiasts but instead retirees whose entire music collection is in vinyl and are just happy to still be able to play what they have

i felt this way about a few of the items in this video and some recent videos i think its especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices

other than that youve done an amazing job as always and i cant wait to see the next one

everton premierleague eveche",435,"9 points in 9 days evertonians will suffer no longer 
congratulations to everton you guys fought like warriors deserving victory
everton has done it props to everton for getting chelsea ready for the championship 
dwight mcneil such a baller to be honest
everton with all their workrate determination and belief fully deserved to win 
so happy for dobbin well done young man 
      
im a wolves supporter but always like to see you boys do well glad you have bounced back after the point deduction all the best for the rest of the season 
how good is it to see our players just hitting the ball with confidence into the back of the net
mykolenko is awesome beast  real professional model 
dobbin what a moment for the young man hope theres more to come
this is the everton i always know the team that is extremely tough to play against good game 
so pleased for sean dyche and his players another fantastic result fully deserved really starting to gel as a team now all confidence at this level
everton were on the verge of relegation in 2021 2022 they always found a way to survive this season is much harder as they were playing well until 10 point deduction again put them in relegation battle but they still dont give up surely despite the difficulties they will fight and stay in premier league as they have been great despite the deduction credits goes to sean dyche too for keeping everton team spirits high
as a manchester united fan im happy everton is back in form and not looking like they r going to slow down
didnt ever look like conceding stayed in the game and took two chances when they came along youll never beat the toffees 
doucoure is a dyche masterclass all those years he was too deep until dyche moved him up now he scores every week always at right place at the right time
although not an everton fan but still feel justice for them for winning 3 games in a row feel they were harsh for being deducted 10 points but they already taken 9 points from e last 3 games really salute them n sean dyche
such a massive win
your club is impressive and im glad for pickford aswell 
the best goalkeeper in the league loyal to his club deserve to stay in pl with his team
another great victory sean dyche is getting us fighting for 90 minutes and playing some decent attacking football to boot
it feels good to be a toffee again even with a disproportionate 10points deduction keep it going

oh my goodness how on earth did that poor little seal drag that bucket around that rope was so tight around its neck you could see it expand when you cut it well done guys i dont know how much longer that baby seal could have survived another great rescue a really good job
thank you all such lucky happy little pups that bucket was one of the deadliest ive seen you do great team work
the little one dragging the bucket was so relieved and definitely seemed to understand he needed help and excepted it graciously
        
               
no way the pup dragging that bucket behind him would have had a chance to survive in the water thanks ocnteam for saving these two pups lives
1 seal didnt have much time left and what a horrible mess it had to deal with 2 was another one of those ball lines that also would have lead to its demise the way it was wrapped around the body thank you ocn for saving these babies and talking to them in a way to help calm them down is always so cute 
as someone with asthma i know what the seals feel when they are able to breathe freely  thank you for yalls unswerving efforts to helping seals and other wildlife have a wonderful and safe healthy holiday season 
thank you for the work you do  its interesting and helps to inform the public what these animals go through just to survive
watched seaspiracy last nightheartbreaking thank you all for helping fix this mess weve made of the oceans
thank you to the entire ocn team for everything you do to release the seals from those dangerous entanglements
well done two more little lives saved 
the things those little guys pickup  its a miracle they make it out of the water strong to be pulling a bucket around thank you for saving them
ive been watching these heroes of the sea life for years and keep wondering when they will give up on the endless need for saving seals from ghost gear entanglements but they persist with skill and empathy week after week year after year so grateful

CA,YerFRnGDBYE,no bank loaned them money they built dream hobbit home themselves,kirsten dirksen,2023-12-10T15:19:25Z,"underground home,earth-sheltered home,underground dome home,hobbit home,hobbit villa,earth-sheltered dome home,dome kit home,extreme weather home,personal building odyssey,natural cooling,bioclimatic home,self-financed home,earthquake-proof home,hurricane-proof home,hyper-insulated home,mortgage-free home,steve travis,jeff ingram,newport,oregon",100189,4585,"when no bank would give them a loan for a sunken dome home steve travis and jeff ingram began to build the earthsheltered hobbit villa on their own financing each step paycheck to paycheck and getting creative they used recycled highway signs to lay the forms for the concrete foundation 

they held a domeraising party to erect the ibeams purchased as a dome kit they tied their own rebar for a full year they lived in a fifthwheel trailer for 6 years before finally moving into a halfbuilt house

their commitment paid off today the couple has spent a decade living mortgagefree in a home that is built to withstand a nuclear blast as well as hurricanes and earthquakes they are in a fault zone they have no heating or cooling bills since the home is hyperinsulated there are 1000 tons of earth on top of the house explains steve the weight adds strength to the structure  like an egg because of the barrelhauled structure the weight of the earth compresses it and makes it stronger  but the main aspect is the thermal mass insulation value per code the county made them put in two bedroom wall heaters but they have never needed them 

the home is maintenancefree except for having to mow the roof which now bathes the entire home in green weve had people say it must be like living in a cave but theres light everywhere in this house 

because the walls arent loadbearing the barrel vaults hold the home in compression they were able to create huge windows on three sides of the home allowing in plenty of southern light more than any home weve ever lived in

on faircompanies httpsfaircompaniescomvideosnobankloanedthemmoneytheybuiltdreamhobbithomethemselves",234,"i like people like this no bank would give them a loan but they created a new alternative
this home is not only cozy and has gorgeous views it saves money and is built like a tank  a true shelter from the elements
amazing ive watched your channel kirsten for years and years always impressed by so many homes  structures youve featured this one is up there in my top ten faves of your visits to spectacular homes i love the ceiling   like an unpainted sistine chapel or the mihrab dome in the great mosque of crdoba spain its my dream to build something like this
my husband and i did the same kind of thing we had a 4000 sq ft round house that took us 12 years  he passed not long after and i moved that was 18 years ago now
this house and the way they built is very inspirational i love this
what a creative design and commitment views are stunning i actually considered building something similar but chickened out when i read articles about water issues plus the topography of my land really only allowed for windows on one side of the house what i love the most about your home are the  large windows on multiple sides i ended up building a gray shake shingle traditional home with white trim and window boxes i must mention i have a blush pink front door i built the home with tons of windows and views of rolling hills and a forest i watch the sunsets from my screened porch every night it makes me feel very connected with nature i purchased the land 25 years ago and built about one year ago and im in love with the property really enjoyed the tour of your home and i completely understand your  labor of love
i cant believe i am watching my friends steve and jeffs house it is a wonderful house story  thanks so much
i love this home in ways that might take forever to describeit has so much of all the ways i have wanted to build a home since i discovered earth based homes in 1979
i live in this arealove this so much i have been in an underground house here in oregon and what i loved about it was how quiet it was those views are to die for
i agree more homes should be built this way  nice job steve n jeff 
thank to the authors and the owners of the house for such an interesting project so happy for people that dont accept established rules and do what they want and feel i personally always felt that common square box paradigm of construction are such a mistake that was made once long time ago and continuing now squares and triangles are just unnatural almost nowhere in the nature we can find such forms but we still use them while building structures where we spend most of our time
wow what an amazing home the whole home is a artistic work in progress what a beautiful place to live
that concrete bench top 
such a beautiful home thank you for showing us this masterpiece 
absolutely  im in the process of placing wheels under everything i can  not to facilitate dance parties but those of us who are older want to be able to easily move furniture so we can more easily clean  whatever anyones reason is it just seems more logical  although i suppose most people would think it strange 

i also lived in a house with a lot of sunlight coming in too but living in the northern hemisphere the sunlight only reached into  4   45 into the house  just as this house in the video does depending on the time of year  i cant afford to build and live in my own house now but i often wondered about living in a narrow house where the darkness is cut off and the sunlight reaches more into the interior of the house but of course you sacrifice space  however no worries  there is the mass of the house which captures the heat  a couple of ways to heat  sunlight and or mass of the structure 

the interior is beautiful  with the curved surfaces and the out side of the house is covered green which is interesting  but  another sacrifice is that with a right angled home you have surfaces you can paint although far more expensive  im thinking about the black exteriors of homes in the faroe islands places in norway  and the beautiful glossy dark green or black paint on the homes in the island in the netherlands   marken also the beautiful whites and blues greece and spain tiles too or the exterior colors on the buildings in parts of europe this family has chosen a different path

oh yes as others have mentioned  gorgeous views

danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
for me barbie in the nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation
i would just like to point out that dannys little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker its a toy soldier
did you drink enough water today shoutout to air up for sponsoring this video try scentbased taste right now you cant miss all these holiday deals httpsairuplink3mmlipo
i could not take it with the dads reaction to the pebble i was laughing so hard the blank stare the trembling hands the concerned look from his wife like what could this rock have possibly done to you why do they never talk about it again
i love how what started as a quirky and unconventional nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left danny with more questions than answers about the original tale
fun fact this movie was funded by literal russian state and was the most expensive russian movie to date
ill be honest as a ballerina just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was hysterical
i would gladly watch you review ballets swan lake has like 4 different endings i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives
as a ballerina watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious especially when you referred to fritz as this little freak
that end bit scared me so bad i actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat seeing danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing ive witnessed in a while
its nice to see danny hasnt lost his christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen
can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with dannys toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass
i laughed so hard i fell off my bed when he said he misses his pebble
im honestly surprised that danny didnt make the connection that love on a leash also had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form now i just wanna know if theres any more movies with characters like that
what a stunning cast baby elle fanning snowbell from stuart little and moaning myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of the nutcracker the worlds ever seen
hiring albert einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex ive ever seen
thank you for watching the ballet danny sincerely every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the nutcracker
my little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago i rented this for her hoping shed love it i feel so bad 
in all the versions of the nutcracker ive seen drosselmeyer has a clownassistant guy with him not a child ive always loved the energy of just showing up to a family event with your clown friend who doesnt break character the entire time",23,Comedy,6360000,PT28M49S,"['little danny just sitting there with his huge top hat while someone constantly yelling out his name and just completely ignoring them awesome', 'danny not_ knowing the nutcracker ballet with word probably the most entertaining part this video', 'for barbie the nutcracker will always the superior adaptation', 'would just like point out that dannys little nutcracker guy not_ even nutcracker toy soldier', 'did you drink enough water today shoutout air for sponsoring this video try scentbased taste right now you cannot miss all these holiday deal', 'could not_ take with the dad reaction the pebble laughing hard the blank stare the trembling hand the concerned look from his wife like what could this rock have possibly done you why they never talk about again', 'love how what started quirky and unconventional nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into existential nightmare that only left danny with more question than answer about the original tale', 'fun fact this movie funded literal russian state and the most expensive russian movie date', 'ill honest ballerina just seeing your take the actual ballet hysterical', 'would gladly watch you review ballet swan lake like different ending think you should pick random recorded version and make bet see who survives', 'ballerina watchig you react the real nutcracker hilarious especially when you referred fritz this little freak', 'that end bit scared bad actually gasped with horror and heart skipped beat seeing danny staring the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint the most terrifying thing have witnessed while', 'nice see danny not_ lost his christmas spirit even after his room broken into and all his stuff stolen', 'can appreciate how well this come into full circle with that one skit from long time ago with dannys toy soldier becoming real boy through the glass', 'laughed hard fell off bed when said miss his pebble', 'honestly surprised that danny did not_ make the connection that love leash also had supernatural esque love interest that horrid piece sht their cursed form and completely entirely normal their human form now just want know there any more movie with character like that', 'what stunning cast baby elle fanning snowbell from stuart little and moaning myrtel all working together make the most amazing rendition the nutcracker the world ever seen', 'hiring albert einstein babysitter the most hilarious flex have ever seen', 'thank you for watching the ballet danny sincerely every ballet dancer who suffered through performing the nutcracker', 'little sister obsessed with nutcracker few year ago rented this for her hoping she would love feel bad', 'all the version the nutcracker have seen drosselmeyer clownassistant guy with him not_ child have always loved the energy just showing family event with your clown friend who doe not_ break character the entire time']",1729

unlike most of your covered incidents this seemed much less a swiss cheese model and much more a tragic plethora of challenges and confusion happening all at once so sad since the crew had been so professional and cautious
ive been an airline captain for 37 consecutive years have in excess of 27000 hrs pic on 777 767 737 a320 727 and atr 
im still learning been lucky on my career so far without any serious trouble to date
i must say this channels content is the most precious ever its a valuable learning tool 
my sincere compliments to mentour pilot
i live in rostovondon and this tragedy really shocked all of us and unfortunately someone i know were affected and lost the members of their families ive read a lot of investigations and different articles about this catastrophe but only here and now i really understood what happened thank you for this video and explanation and may all the crash victims rest in peace 
im an air traffic controller and we use your videos extensively during ect not only to provide better assistance during time of need but also to learn valuable lessons that could potentially help us in the future never too old or experienced to learn and your videos serve as excellent library of information thank you for the amazing content
the copilot was a friend of my brother and i from years before the tragedy we knew him quite well from those years he was smart and thorough i investigated all that i could of how and what happened and i saw he tried to save this situation as much as possible but the captain was tremendously confused and deep in tunnel vision to back off his decisions and start trusting instruments in time very very sad rip alex
ive been a pilot for 17 years here in germany not only is this channel informative it also serves as a valuable learning tool for pilots all across the globe the simulator is a fantastic learning device but most accidents i feel can be attributed to overload stress and crew resource management basic communication between crew members is absolutely essential if something is wrong mention it and a good captain uses his resources and listens inexperience does not always equal a wrong answer 

thank you for your videos they are second to none and a vital resource for any current or future pilot you may be saving future lives with your informative videos
i remember watching your videos when you were on the sofa with the notes and the dogs there was nothing wrong with that and i still love your old video but its so amazing to see how youve grown the channel into making tv quality documentaries at this point youre an inspiration petter
i can only imagine how fast the final 59 seconds must have occurred in that cockpit also to be in the back of the plane at that time of morning after waiting and waiting and waiting the horror that some of the alert passengers must have realized was about to happen i can only pray that the impact was so sudden so severe and so instant that nobody had any chance to feel that for even a second wonderful job here as always describing the events as true to life as possibly thank you

i was not really prepared for this to end in such a tragic crash it seemed like such a simple issue but unfortunately that wasnt the case this is one of the accidents that are so sad because it seemed so preventable my condolences to all who lost their loved ones
as a frequent flyer i treasure these insights into how safe aviation travel is  flying is complicated and yet flying is still the safest mode of transportation  channels like yours showcase what can go wrong but highlight what prevents these accidents from happening in the first place
great job petter describing a sad accident that simply should not have happened
im a retired 30k hour captain with lots of time on both the 737800 with its fabulous hud and other boeings up to and including the 747400
it was a really sad very disturbing story showing how absolutely critical it is to stay ahead of the aeroplane 
i wonder why he was so loathe to use autopilot in such conditions
the quality of the explanation at 3316 behindahead of the aircraft is just insane thank you mentour for letting us enjoy your lectures
my friend live in a building bordering the airport 
when plane smashed into the ground the whole building was shaken and few windows got broken 
some small fragments of the aircraft were scattered across his and some nearby buildings roofs 

that should give you a rough idea of the forces involved
as a young engineer that only just started her career in aviation i must thank you and your team for your hard work explaining each and every incident you cannot imagine how your content not only helps pilots but also other people who work in aviation
thanks to your content ive understood things more in depth and it brought a new meaning to my job as an aeronautics engineer and how much every detail can make a change

keep up the good work 
the fltcrew were well trained and performed well until the 2nd approach this terrible accident brings many things into question including if were reaching the limits of the manmachine interface as it currently exist 
pieter your content and presentation is absolutely amazing 
i felt this one in my bones
rip to all aboard
these episodes now blow any sort of nat geo type air incident documentaries with all their overly dramatic entertainment elements out of the water
massive thanks to you petter and all of your superb team  so well explained presented and executed
patreon membership here i come 
albert einstein said if you cant explain it to a six year old you dont understand it yourself i am not 6 years old but when it comes to aviation i may as well be after watching your videos i can give a reasonable explanation as to what happened in the event you reviewed proud to be part of you patron crew keep the videos coming
oh wow throughout almost the entire video right up until you told us that the gpws warnings were too late i had been thinking that this was going to be one of those near miss incidents where they went through some terrifying loss of control but were able to pull through in the end  i hadnt ever heard of this accident before and figured that if it had ended in a fatal crash id have known about it

the masked enemy is going to be absolute chaos with the larger lobby mod with giant groups of them on the map
the horrorcomedy combo of the masked in the ship repeatedly walking over the whoopie cushion 
no intro straight to business perfection
masked a creepy figure which takes over the body of the individual it possesses like a parasite forcing them to turn against their teammates to spread the mask

nutcracker lmao shotgun
it would be fun if the mask gives you some incredible power temporarily see monsters through walls temporarily see loot through walls etc but with an increasing chance of becoming possessed with each use
the masked is actually a great way to implement the mimic idea they didnt lean too much into the horror and too much into the comedy and fits the game perfectly
hey wurps i know you probably wont see this but i really wanna state how helpful each video of yours has been all are very informative and ive learned more tricks than i can count with your help keep making more
the spray can is very useful i remember an old indie game called erie had it as a mechanic to remind yourself where the exit at
i love the asthmatic of comedytragedy masks so when i saw that they added them i was ecstatic

i check the shop hoping to see the mask as a cosmetic for that day instead i leave with the pajama man i now worship the pajama man but thats besides the point

as i enter titan i stumble across a storage type room about 3 rooms from the door on one of the shelves i find a fancy mask darn its a scrap not a cosmetic i wonder if i can wear it 

to my glee you can left click to hold the mask to your face i should scare someone when they enter i though

twice more i put on the mask but right before someone enters i suddenly cannot remove the mask and everything turns red all they hear is my anguished cries before i go silent i proceeded to kill my entire team resulting in us losing the quota worth of scrap and one day to make it up

this game is awful 1010 would do again
one big thing to note about the masked enemies is that they will follow you outside the facility
someone should make a decoy that looks like a playerscarecrow that can be places to hold the coil head in space by looking at it
my friends and i discovered the masks organically we brought a mask back to the ship as well as a crewmates body when the mask makes contact with a corpse it automatically takes it over we were very confused as to why our friends body just got up and started walking
702 max speed is slightly less  you get the fear effect whenever it spots you
i love that players that have been bodyjacked by a shyguy still keep their friendly marker on the ship radar so unaware cams players can try to rescue them with the teleporter
my god i was just thinking that i wanted an enemy that hijacks your body this dev knows whats fun 
i hope that masked teamates still appear friendly on the radar i want mind games
important thing about the mask it can possess corpses always be wary of abandoning a corpse in rend you might see it walk out of the front door
i find it funny how the aracnophobia mode was added because just yesterday i was teaching a young cousin about the game and he was handling the game pretty well very scared all this considered but when it got to the spiders he got absolutely terrified when he was walking back trying to find the way out and found spider webs and i told him that was the bunker spider and he asked me to pick the keyboard and play just for that bit so he could go back to the ship and continue playing after id say the aracnophobia option will help him greatly lmao
i absolutely love love love that the power of the signal transmitter to keep the run alive is matched by it also just being another source of dread and terror
 imagine you are in the facility alone in the dark surrounded by monsters and you just see r u n or g o o d b y e fill your entire vision
 that is such a disheartening way to send bad news its perfect
what makes the masked so terrifying is that you dont even need a living person to be taken over the mask can also possess dead bodies lying on the floor",20,Gaming,14900,PT8M14S,"['the signal translator both really cool but also low key kind terrifying because how slow transmits data might too late the time you are reading', 'the masked enemy going absolute chaos with the larger lobby mod with giant group them the map', 'the horrorcomedy combo the masked the ship repeatedly walking over the whoopie cushion', 'intro straight business perfection', 'masked creepy figure which take over the body the individual posse like parasite forcing them turn against their teammate spread the mask', '', 'nutcracker lmao shotgun', 'would fun the mask give you some incredible power temporarily see monster through wall temporarily see loot through wall etc but with increasing chance becoming possessed with each use', 'the masked actually great way implement the mimic idea they did not_ lean too much into the horror and too much into the comedy and fit the game perfectly', 'hey wurps know you probably will not_ see this but really want state how helpful each video yours been all are very informative and have learned more trick than can count with your help keep making more', 'the spray can very useful remember old indie game called erie had mechanic remind yourself where the exit', 'love the asthmatic comedytragedy mask when saw that they added them ecstatic', '', 'check the shop hoping see the mask cosmetic for that day instead leave with the pajama man now worship the pajama man but that besides the point', '', 'enter titan stumble across storage type room about room from the door one the shelf find fancy mask darn scrap not_ cosmetic wonder can wear', '', 'glee you can left click hold the mask your face should scare someone when they enter though', '', 'twice more put the mask but right before someone enters suddenly cannot remove the mask and everything turn red all they hear anguished cry before silent proceeded kill entire team resulting losing the quota worth scrap and one day make', '', 'this game awful 1010 would again', 'one big thing note about the masked enemy that they will follow you outside the facility', 'someone should make decoy that look like playerscarecrow that can place hold the coil head space looking', 'friend and discovered the mask organically brought mask back the ship well crewmates body when the mask make contact with corpse automatically take over were very confused why our friend body just got and started walking', '702 max speed slightly you get the fear effect whenever spot you', 'love that player that have been bodyjacked shyguy still keep their friendly marker the ship radar unaware cam player can try rescue them with the teleporter', 'god just thinking that wanted enemy that hijack your body this dev know what fun', 'hope that masked teamates still appear friendly the radar want mind game', 'important thing about the mask can posse corps always wary abandoning corpse rend you might see walk out the front door', 'find funny how the aracnophobia mode added because just yesterday teaching young cousin about the game and handling the game pretty well very scared all this considered but when got the spider got absolutely terrified when walking back trying find the way out and found spider web and told him that the bunker spider and asked pick the keyboard and play just for that bit could back the ship and continue playing after say the aracnophobia option will help him greatly lmao', 'absolutely love love love that the power the signal transmitter keep the run alive matched also just being another source dread and terror', 'imagine you are the facility alone the dark surrounded monster and you just see you fill your entire vision', 'that such disheartening way send bad news perfect', 'what make the masked terrifying that you not_ even need living person taken over the mask can also posse dead body lying the floor']",494

thank you so much for being here and watching
i really hope you enjoyed 

miamaples dior expensive",4430,"the fact that the dior advent calendar is more expensive than buying everything individually at retail price
petition for mia to turn the dior box into a doll house
i love that dior is so aware that their 5400 is ridiculous that they actually pay someone to call you up and ask are you sure 
the disney swarovski set was underwhelming given how many characters disney owns
charlotte tillbury one was the only one thats worth it it provided all the basics that you need for makeupbesides foundation and concealer and stuff that you need to pick individually for your skin complexion so if someone wants to get into charlotte tillbury or just high end makeup this will be a perfect thing to buy props to them
only mama maples can make the best out of the worst situation of being scammed but a luxury company
in my limited experience the more expensive the calendar the higher the disappointment cant go wrong with a cheap one its only up from there 
i got progressively angrier at dior the farther we went even if they did retail that much theyre a scam and they dont even retail its disgusting
im a retired nurse  and in my life would never be able to afford  to indulge in even one of these products  saying that  i really enjoyed seeing you and your mom unbox these calendars  thank you for the opportunity to experience this with you this is the first video ive watched of yours and subscribed immediately  merry christmas and happy new year
has mama maples ever not been a ray of absolute sunshine   i cannot imagine her mad
i dont know maybe the cost was making you guys giddy but i cackled so hard during the dior unboxing thanks for the laugh 
am i the only one hearing that they are saying swarvoski and she also spelled it that way on the screen where she announces the different advent calendars i think thats so funny  love the energy
also the fact that mama maples tries to educate mia on all the disney characters is sooo funny 
watching mias advent calendar videos is now one of my christmas traditions lol i get stunned by the prices every year
mia im sorry that dior is so extra however these are the most fun videos i look forward to them every year i love momma maples reactions shes so priceless thank you
1913 the moment mia goes to stop mama maples from trying the lipstick  she is so cute
both of those went totally in a different direction than i expected i thought disney would be a new character every box and i have no idea why dior i assumed makeup this was a wild ride 
i love when your mom gets excited about opening the boxes the wows all made me laugh

i like the new fortnite lego game mode its something new and fresh
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest its way better than we all expected
one can only imagine how theyre going to continue developing the mode it has so much potential i cant wait to see where we go from here personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
also i found out if youre behind a bush while killing the boss dude he wont attack you he gets confused also another glitch if you put down a new chest and put your swords farming tools etc in it and punch it to break it it heals your weapons and farming tools note this will be patched asap im sure but it works for now
i hope you enjoyed the new mode its been a ton of fun for me and the boys 
i think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby as a person who experienced that myself today was my first time playing chapter 5 i absolutely loved battle royale but i clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in lego
i had some experience with motion capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall kudos to the devs its a funny detail you wouldnt neccessary expect in a game like this one ps you almost saw me as leon in these new resident evil games 
so far this mode is pretty similar to minecraft if they update regularly this can become an original masterpiece
keep it up creamy the new mode is really fun tho
you know its a good day when mccreamy uploads
ive been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative im so excited for this game mode theres so many possibilities
mccreamy is a legend bro makes a boring day into a good one love this guy 
i think that this is the best day that theyve had in a while amazing job fortnite 
mccreamy never fails to make good content  
can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us

fortnite fortnitetips lego legofortnite fortnitelego guide gaming gameplay minecraft survivalgame  fortnitebattleroyale tipsandtricks legofortnitetips",247,"when the npcs are glitching out like that then try talking to them first  if that doesnt work then continue doing what youre doing
one thing i like about the prefab builds is theyre modular you can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with shack doors to create passible outbuildings
biggest building issue ive had is there doesnt seem to be a way to change the elevation of your nonprefab foundations making it hard to keep things at the same level
destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
you can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches  yes it costs more wood however itll light up the cave for you so its easier to find whatever your looking for
before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating not a tip
dont just throw away tools that you dont use use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it they can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation
really fantastic synopsis and tips you nailed it i would add 
build your first village at the edge of a desert border and near a knotwood cave not where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient
build a bed at the mouth of a cave as a save point if you die you respawn in your bed you wont have to travel back to your quest point
empty almost all of your backpack before beginning a quest youll need the inventory slots
pack for a trip max wood planks to build repair chests cooked food snowberry shakes or cheesy burgers
its good to stack lumber mills it makes crafting so much quicker
something i always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever i need to collect granite i take that villager and start going at some rocks unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
if you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and itll destroy everything for you
go on top of moutains that have large trees cut them down roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
i love to make a village stylish and neat it is the most important thing 
man this was one of the coolest surprises of the year  ive always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome  whod have thought it would be fortnite to do it
youre lucky  the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and thats with infinite stamina  however the cold biome is 2 steps away
make glider  build staircases 11 high make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as i land i build another one so i can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol i even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so i know the direction they follow back to back  helps tons on the map
stamina bar is important when youre flying with a glider it consumes your stamina while up in the air by the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die
i personally think temp dont matter as muchbut stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didnt go down so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills lumber mills work benches etc then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
the way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me that way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells and the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S,"['when the npc are glitching out like that then try talking them first that doe not_ work then continue doing what you are doing', 'one thing like about the prefab build they are modular you can knock out the wall double shack and replace them with shack door create passible outbuilding', 'biggest building issue have had there doe not_ seem way change the elevation your nonprefab foundation making hard keep thing the same level', 'destroying bush actually easier with sword', 'for right now traveling the main issue cannot that you have walk min just get cave once you mined the cave kind nearby your village walk min the next dessert just you can die bcs you did not_ know that the mob there are way stronger', 'you can also build campfire inside cave instead using torch yes cost more wood however will light the cave for you easier find whatever your looking for', 'before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting cheating not_ tip', 'not_ just throw away tool that you not_ use use villager follower and you can give them those tool and they will use they can hold multiple tool and just swap the best one depending the situation', 'really fantastic synopsis and tip you nailed would add', 'build your first village the edge desert border and near knotwood cave not_ where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient', 'build bed the mouth cave save point you die you respawn your bed you will not_ have travel back your quest point', 'empty almost all your backpack before beginning quest you will need the inventory slot', 'pack for trip max wood plank build repair chest cooked food snowberry shake cheesy burger', 'good stack lumber mill make crafting much quicker', 'something always with the spare pickax give one designated adventuring villager and whenever need collect granite take that villager and start going some rock unfortunately they still use the pickax for fighting even over even though the brown pickaxe doe damage per second compared just punching keep that mind you are messing about the dark with them', 'you find boulder hill and you need mat just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and will destroy everything for you', 'top moutains that have large tree cut them down roll the log down farm granite and wood super easy', 'love make village stylish and neat the most important thing', 'man this one the coolest surprise the year have always thought minecraft style game the lego world would awesome who would have thought would fortnite', 'you are lucky the desert minute run away from spawn point and that with infinite stamen however the cold biome step away', 'make glider build staircase high make platform and you now got jump pad that will take you way further then the geyser and soon land build another one can basically the whole map under min instead hour lol even put marker every staircase jump pad know the direction they follow back back help ton the map', 'stamen bar important when you are flying with glider consumes your stamen while the air the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die', 'personally think temp not_ matter muchbut stam will literally make you the beginning because you can just outrun most early thing like wolf', 'noticed when you broke your grill the village point did not_ down technically you could just place down crap ton grill lumber mill work bench etc then destroy them get the material back and again and again', 'the way get the sand shell using shield and getting one villager follow that way follower can get the attention and can ham for the shell and the shield help the randomly start going for you']",668

3004 blooper",1935,"anthony telling shayne how important he is to smosh  how much he respects him is a major highlight shayne deserves his flowers
cant wait to see 20mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh
really happy to see where smosh is currently
i almost teared up when anthony at the end says that shayne has kept the true meaning of smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera its so true and thats what makes smosh so special especially the cast now you can see how close everyone is with each other and from ian and anthony to chance and angela the newest cast members everyone just puts a big smile on my face
come back next week for a new assumptions episode with openly gay pastors
members watch uncensored  ad free httpsyoutubecomanthonypadillajoin
man at the beginning when anthony started listing all the eras shayne went through i got so sad these people carried smosh through its darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old smosh shayne courtney damien etc truly are the unsung heroes of smosh
ill basically watch shayne do anything for any amount of time
i love this era of smosh smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter were now honoring smosh for everything theyve done and seeing how theyve become a giant family warms my heart what a time to be alive
shaynes depth as a human is what made me enjoy smosh more i remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is as someone else who loves reading and thinks it more than anything else can develop a person that was nice to see  hes genuine intelligent and over the top absurd love him
dearest shayne i cant tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on smosh this entire time we dont know what we would ever do without you you are not only hilarious but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member i see how invested you are in other people we all love you and please keep doing what youre doing
ian and anthony are the parents of main but pit and games are shaynes babies he really carried those channels for so long my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic woo shayne shayne it up
i actually really like the idea of interviewing smosh cast members
shayne is just such a pleasant person he seems so fun and nice to be around love seeing anthony and shayne together again the we bought smosh arc really is the best timeline
the way shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how i know he has the brain of an artist
him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome  deserves the world honestly
im glad that shayne is getting some flowers hes clearly a comedy powerhouse and very hardworking and loyal but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person im sure success will find him whatever he gets up to but im glad its smosh right now 
i respect everything that shane has done as he is my favorite cast member he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to smosh  has helped kept it alive alongside courtney  ian
not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but i feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way
im gonna be honest the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of shayne i find him the most funny comforting relatable and inspiring personality on the internet love you shayne
i dont know if shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry like i remember that scene of the office when jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives and we can see all that with shayne anthony and the rest of the smosh crew theyre all incredible people and its awesome to see how far they have all grown

honesty and integrity  thats fortnine  i havent had a bike for years but still watch the content anyway  plus ryan is one of canadas national treasures  part of our ryan trifecta with reynolds and gosling
heck yeah man i have so much respect for your decision to not only not sell crap but to resist the tooeasy choice of outsourcing to the lowest bidder in a horrible factory thank you
this sounds like hyperbole its not ryan i am always amazed and impressed with your writing directing and filmmaking witty words and sneaky visual jokes in every video just enough video to make your point yet also entertaining i appreciate your work and integrity
love that ryan highlights how we buy unnecessary things my motorcycle key is always on its own i guess thats another way to solve the problem if you can
a very entertaining informative video about an almost nonexistent problem 

and then a near apology for suggesting you could buy some of his merch and an almost warning not to 

and i listened to it twice while working in the garage because ryans videos are that good
i love that you guys showed your iterative process whether they were bad or good it is really nice to know that you guys thought out the concept and tested every possible scenario out first before finalizing the product and going to mass manufacture keep up the good work i only have one motorcycle at the moment so i dont think i have a need for such an accessory but maybe one day i will and ill be thinking of you guys
so well made and honest advertisement with the viewer as equally valued human i dont own a motorcycle but am drawn to the charm and quality of this channel 
bloody love the comedy ryan can produce while still being more informative than most documentarys
this channel is absolutely upper tier work and class love the f9 crew
glad to see someone other than myself recognized this problem and you came up with a great design and i like your attitude as always keep up the great work guys
rare to find a seller saying dont buy unless you really need it refreshing honesty in a world of sales hype
nice design definitely solving a real problem looks good two small issues potentially i the metal stud might still scratch the trip clamp unless you insert the key correct side up which is the problem youre trying to solve and ii the fixed dimensions of the leather patch means no more than x number of keys can be accommodated including possibly not the 6 or 8 keys you mentioned
i was planning on typing up a novel on how your channel is the best in existence for motorcycle and other stuff content you are a legend and the content you provide is and hopefully will remain premo otherwise it will blend with all the other junk out there kudos for not providing junk keep up the great work looking forward to more quality stuff
as for the grommets you can also wrap some or all of the keys in silicone rubber key caps available at your local hardware store
bellroy key cover made exactly like your 3d printed version and works great ive used one for years now made of leather uses magnetic enclosure and holds up to 8 keys it is more costly though but i use it for my everyday keys 

my motorcycles have always had their own dedicated soft key chains with their respective keys being the only ones attached to it
nice little invention  solving a nearly nonexistent problem love it  after losing my standalone key by dropping it finally finding it in the forkguards after disassembling half the bike i made a semibraided paracord loop with plenty of knots to increase its footprint plus no rattling or scratches  i can feel it with gloves on and in a pants pocket and i used paracord with reflective fibers woven in so if i drop it in the dark a sweep with a flashlight or headlamp will hopefully reveal it quickly  i have a mini carabiner on the waist adjuster of my jacket to hold it which i can get to without looking while im doing the helmetglove dance  these chipped keys are good and bad and losing one is bad on all sorts of levels",2,Autos & Vehicles,1850000,PT5M31S,"['the most important feature

sorry for the confusion i made the list for myselfadded the games i interested with btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event you can look for them
the orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of oscars the flute guy especially man he absolutely nailed it
i loved hearing the alan wake director speak on both occassions he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching
12915 loved geoff keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the hello kitty game best moment for me
lets all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there what a legend
congratulations larian you absolutely deserve all these awards and more
congratulations to every other winnernominee as well

in all honesty bg3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo but im happy totk ff16 alan wake 2 and hifi rush won some awards as well would have been perfect if lies of p won best art direction
sami jrvi aka sam lake just is remedy entertainment
this guy is living his job 
performing the choriography with poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make
remedy pretty much never dissappoints
cheers
flute guy is the pillar of the game awards that absolutely everyone can get behind we may all like different games but our celebration of flute guy is unanimous
huge congratulations to neil newbon and all the other baldurs gate 3 makers you have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves

thanks to all of our gold level patrons marisa alfonso wendy tran traci lew matthew tadros",2594,"marissa and zach have the energy of two siblings determined to ruin each others days
the guys have come so far since the very first war episodes

proud to say i have survived another season

still one of my all time favorite shows to film 
you should have a flipped season where all the experts have to try to remake all the dumb shit the guys have invented but actually good
i still want a reverse war where they challenge 4 experts to make something without a recipe and the try guys judge them
one of the things that i think is really impressive about keith is that hes able to see when hes messed something up really badly toss it out and then make something to fill the gap that isnt perfect but works he might not be the best cook but hes got some genuine skill that just needs a recipe
i love the judges reactions when keith brought out his smores noelle was concerned but hopeful whilst jonny  rosanna were like oh god not again 
this is the first war where i vehemently disagree with the judges zach should not have come in 4th place over marissa whose marshmallow literally almost made a judge vomit out of all of the smores i wanted to try zachs the most i am happy that eugene won tho those tartlets looked so pretty 
johnny was fighting for all of the creations to be considered smores  that keith mouth comparison had me dying 
im absolutely living for eugenes fancy mellows
we clearly forget the rubric we have a rubric and we just say fck the rubric that line took me out  i love zach lol
i dont know why but when johnny said mama this is a smore made me smile because it reminds me of all the failed and ugly attempts ive had at making something and my aunts or older cousins would be like mama this is good you did good
keith and eugene bring fun and wholesome energy marissa and zach bring low key competitive siblings who are grasping at straws to finish the assignment
something about her sweet tone of voice gives rosanna the same energy as a kindergarten teacher trying to use gentle parenting techniques on a student who just brought a dead squirrel off the road for show and tell
only 10 seconds in and eugene willingly going in for a hug from keith  initiating it  has sent me to another plane of existence  so happy
eugene just happily and casually hugging keith and keith being surprised is just so wholesome considering eugene doesnt like being hugged 
eugene the one who made ro throw up comforting melissa the one who almost made ro throw up is so funny 
eugene helping keith this time how the tables have turned

the hugs and kisses from eugene at the beginning were so cute too

bailey has really been dangerous these last few weeks looking like our danger man whenever he gets the ball these days utv
speaking from a liverpool fan 15 consecutive home wins is very impressive
dibu also in impressive form letting him go was one of artetas blunder hes better than both raya and ramsdale
after man city match i had a feeling that arsenal would lose tonight because villa now has the quality to be a true title contender imo as an arsenal fan for 20 years ups and downs being nature i start to admire the enemy no hatred less emotional if we lose we take it because every player on the pitch give their absolute 100 a good team is a good team we have to admit that
speedy recovery for bailey  lets do this villains lets make history 
as a liverpool fan i also congratulate aston villa since unai emery became coach of aston villa this team has played very well and impressively what a match

even when youre not playing at your absolute best and can still grind out the results  thats a sign of a team thats going to do something special
considering emerys tough time at arsenal his english was even mocked by his own players this win is a sweet revenge congrats emery
great performance from villa but i think not enough people are talking about how good havertz was some of his passing was amazing
congrats to aston villa from a lfc fan your goalie is badass vamos emiliano martinez

manchesterunited mufc",1289,"scary thing is this wasnt even the worst performance of the season they have played worse against teams and won
onanas shot stopping comparison is a trex   literally no arms
mark last week ten hag masterclass
mark this week we are a disgrace

chelsea had an awful game last game it wasnt that man utd were amazing it was the fact that chelsea had the worst performance of their season
we lost fair and square to a better team
its very simple chelsea didnt play as well as this team did today so manchester looked good
thought chelsea and today were similar performances conceded a load of chances in both and looked on front foot chelsea couldnt finish but bournemouth could long way to go for this team manager still makes same mistakes picking certain players every game
congrats goldbridge on predicting 30 scoreline
mark has lost ittalking about inconsistency we have been good in one game this season at home to chelsea its factual defending this manager is incomprehensible
threw the game they dont want ten hag and they showed it and your captain doesnt want to play liverpool imagine robson doing that
what have you actually seen from ten hag to suggest hes the right man like hes not won multiple champions leagues and dominated a top league before like a klopp or guardiola i agree half the team needs clearing out but its also entirely possible he isnt up to the job either im genuinely shocked at how tactically naive he is and how unable he is able to actually address glaring issues in the set up
well probably beat bayern 

never learn goldbridge never learn 
its baffling how you draw conclusions based on only looking at the performance of one team bournemouth outplayed villa last week and palace in the week this result was no surprise to a lot of bournemouth fans and it makes it more funny when you predicted an easy 30 win without doing the simplest most cursory homework on your opposition up the cherries 
our captains accidental yellow card
its almost ridiculous to say we played brilliantly against chelsea if we had played against city or liverpool instead of chelsea that day we would have conceded at least 5 goals still eth out
i dont understand how you can believe this team can beat bayern on tuesday and at the same time not recognise that the manager is likely to be the most culpable  he chose the captain and he carries responsibility for motivating the team  if you think the players are good enough to beat bayern then it seems to me that we must have the quality but not the leadership  personally i think we lack passion and aggression too many prima donnas on the pitch and no roy keane to remind them what the job is during the game
onana is the biggest problem hes simply 5 inches shorter than he should be the other problem is the utter failure to find a manu standard number 9 van persie was probably the last one
ive come to realise that shaw cant play lcb without varane there to guide him

whoever plays with varane looks good because hes such a good organiser and reader of the game
eth has made a lot of mistakes not handling players like he should overpaying and bringing in mediocre footballers overtraining players hence our long injury list no clear tactics its like weve got an identity crisis he was never the right manager to begin with give klopp or pep 400 million and theyll buy league winning players eth has no pulling power its just the brand doing everything were done this guy needs to go

if blade turns out to be as good as dishonored 2 it will be a memorable experience being 100 singleplayer is a great start
i couldve shed a tear when they said itll be a thirdperson single player game

thank you arkane lyon
getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most blade thing ever
so glad that a gameplayfocused studio like arkane is doing blade some of the most fluid gunsword gameplay in the biz
perfect mix of character studio and platform
cant wait to see more of this
finally one of my favorite characters gets his own game i love the dark ominous feel that this has 3rd person single player too yes please
ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it i just get excited that someone is making blade
loving the art style already this is definitely going to be visually stunning
love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop it gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires
esto ser un gran juego gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
this a blade game is a fantastic idea this has so much potential the artstyle colour and lighting is astonishing the character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and blade looks like he came straight off the pages 

and the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed the elements of dishonoured and deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit blades combat and abilities out of the upcoming marvel games this is my favourite
glad to see blade gets a new game hopefully they will do the character justice fingers crossed
the fact that were getting the game before the movie is bizarre but im so excited i cant wait for it this looks so dope
esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos
vou voltar aqui todos os dias para apreciar essa obra de arte
muito interessanteaparentemente sera uma animao linda

gee im gonna miss this show but putting your health first is something that we should all value the sake of entertainment isnt cheap thank you for creating such an awesome piece of animation
so this is the canonical ending todd tries to do basic maths and dies

i salute you sheriff hayseed you were fun whilst you lasted
super unique and stylized shame hayseed isnt gonna be finished 
for one side i get why it got canceled the artstyle is amazing and way too high effort for a small team to pull it out with out massive crutch but in the other side i would love seeing this getting a full budget and becoming yet another great youtube indie animated series
ill miss this guy hope your arm gets better eventually
love it pie i really dig the new style i know its been hard to animate with the pain in your wrists lately but you still did an awesome job with this kudos and looking forward to any new material you may put out going forward 
its really unfortunate that this got cancelled i love the animation and the style change looks really nice
its a shame the show is going on indeterminate hiatus i really like these twos chemistry

wwwjurassicparksurvivalcom",6126,"holy cow not only is it a jurassic park game instead of jurassic world to change it up but its a an official survival horror game weve been wanting for years 
if this is anything like alien isolation then were in for the biggest treat ever man i love that theyre going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place
its incredible how jurassic park has a different sense of tension than jurassic world
yes finally ive been waiting for something like this for years 
to me the ford explorer and jeep wrangler will forever be the real heroes of jurassic park takes me right back to my childhood
i cant believe theyre making an actual jurassic park survival horror game this looks incredible the attention to level of detail eg the ford explorer the jeep wrangler the dinosaurs i like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of jurassic park

hopefully this game doesnt disappoint
ive always wanted a jurassic park game like this
as a huge dino fan this is something im eyeing the most to come out i dont care how short or long i can tell im going to throughly enjoy this
the original islandthe original park this feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90s i dont even play new games anymore but im really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan  
it seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now  it looks promising 
ive been imagining a game like this for about 20 years they finally made one
ive never wanted anything more in my life i knew they were gonna do something like this at some point so happy to finally see it
this is what ive been wanting from jurassic park
the makers of jurassic world must take note from this game this is what a true jurassic movie should look and feel like we need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies
what i would really like in the game jurassic park survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993 it would be completely crazy for example we have the proceratosaurus the metriacanthosaurus the segisaurus herrerasaurus and the baryonyx this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of jurassic park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film it allows us to fill a void 
im going to need more gameplay footage  looks suspiciously like a jumpscare funhouse walk and look adventure
this looks incredible already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay thanks for sharing this trailer

woooeee folks let me tell ya i did not intend for this to be such a huge project but when nick and i pulled up to the marketplace sellers driveway and realized this dollhouse was 5 literal feet tall i knew i was in for a doozy but who would i be if i let that stop me so here we go 
ive been seeing a lot of people online turning dollhouses into gingerbread houses and i wanted a piece of that whimsical action i felt like this frozen arendelle dollhouse would be perfect for a little victorian twist so i grabbed my spray paint fake icing and pure determination to make this giant lady a snack
please enjoy heheheeh

gingerbread dollhouse upcycling",1392,"when you said what would christine mcconnell do i thought shed probably bake individual shingles out of gingerbread each with a unique design copied directly from historicallyaccurate examples of victorian wallpaper but with her own spooky spin of including a bat or a mouse in the corner of each only visible with a magnifying glass that shecast out of poured sugar and then i got tired just from thinking about the work that goes into her and your projects and got a snack
if you put the piping tip inside the snipped bag before you fill it with icing and then it stays in place while you pipe 3
welcome to a rachel maksy video where we all ask ourselves what will she turn brown today with the occasional green thing    it turned out great  also try putting the icing tip inside the baggie
my 2 year old just said that is a cute house 

you have the toddler seal of approval 
i feel like this is the home of the queen to whom your lil mouse knight pledges allegiance 
you could display your gingerbread house on your porch for the season i think it would be cute it turned out great by the way the appropriate amount of whimsy
tip if you ever find yourself doing icing like this again cut a hole in the pastry bagsandwich bag and put the tip inside the bag so the tip of it comes out the hole then twist the bag above the icingcaulk and squeeze with your hand on top of the bulb of icingcaulk youll get more control this way and wont have to hold the tip in place this is how i was taught to ice cakecookies when i worked in a bakery 
you made a sweet gingerbread hostel for all of your felt creatures to slumber for winter  love it so much
the idea of rachel being like ah yes i will do a small project a little gingerbread house and then receiving a huge castle is so funny

rachaels reaction to the size of the dollhouse was my reaction to every project i undertake super simple no problems at oh my gosh so relatable and delightful
next step make each room victorian themed and make miniatures 
i just started watching and i am so filled with affection for rachel looking completely overwhelmed by the size of this monstrosity and yet also giddy with the prospect of gingerbreadifying it rachel maksy patron saint of chaotic crafters 3
you took a dna test and bob is in fact your uncle  the gingerbread house turned out so cute
tip for the windows
a lot of people will use sheets of gelatin as the glass in real gingerbread houses 
the peppermint pattyo was a stroke of genius  love it
as someone who is a baker but also does decoden heres some tips  the icing tip goes inside of the bag lol you cut the tip of the bag off put the icing tip inside and then put your silicone in the bag you can twist the top of the bag rubber band it zip tie it etc to keep the silicone from oozing out the top and it also gives you more control of the bag with applying pressure  if you ever want to add color to your silicone you can use mica or oil based paint no waterbased colors because it will cause the silicone to seize up and then you cant pipe it
if rachel and nick ever chose to have kids they are gonna have the most whimsical childhoods
this is becoming such a cool trend i drove to another province to pick up one of these houses with my friend back in october so she could make an awesome haunted house for halloween it turned out amazing i love how this is catching on

isnt it funny how the cost of leveling up walls increases and the amount of troops with special abilities to go through walls also increases 
as a th11 i can confidently say that ill be excited for this update in around a decade

super wall breaker would be vanished from th 16 in some extent  
but loved to see new troop at new townhall
i expect a nerf coming soon even though its not yet officially released this new troop is definitely overpowered 
i feel like a lot of older troops are left out valkyrie is an apparent one but pekka is also significantly downgraded once electro titan is announced they should make a buff to the unusable troops
this new troop is truly amazing i cant wait to try it i see it as a little slow but they have unstoppable power
the troop is pretty interesting it seems kind of op at this moment it adds so much value to a hero dive without taking much space also seems superior to a lot of popular troops like electro titans and hogs interesting to see how it works out seems like it could break th 15 a bit
i cant wait to see the root rider dominate in pro games
i think that the apprentice warden is going to pair really well with it it boosts its health so much and if im not wrong it can jump over walls if not root riders will break them anyways 
the extra hp will be of great value especially if u use a qc root rider attack
for the ones who noticed two icons above the king 

new blacksmith building is coming to have different abilities for heroes
upcoming sneak peak i think it will be on our heroes ability charging option or somethingmore cooler
 i am so much excited before seeing it 
i liked the troop but i think they could have game her a better ability with the root manipulation concept like using the roots to force stop defenses for limited amount of time
i think they are kinda bad due to their low dps they are more like pseudo tank that crushes walls along the way and isnt prone to spring traps so i can see them being used instead of ice golems sometimes i think their best use case would be with super bowler smash since you would be able to use it without jump due to how good they are at breaking walls
always my first stop for all the new update information thanks judo all of the videos as always are well designed and very informative you and the other content creators are as much a part of the game as the game itself keep it up my friend
honestly i feel like ive really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through an attack strategy with basic commentary keep it up judo
to add to what judo said about using super wall breakers for king pathing the root riders are just a normal troop whereas the super wall breaker is a super troop so you dont have use your dark elixir or super potion im definitely looking forward to this troop ",20,Gaming,2730000,PT9M1S,"['troop can', 'jump over wall', 'dig pas under wall', 'crush wall second', 'fly over wall', '', 'and supercell likethe new level wall cost million coin per wall', '', 'not_ funny how the cost leveling wall increase and the amount troop with special ability through wall also increase', 'th11 can confidently say that ill excited for this update around decade', 'amazing how far coc come even after year still have much fun playing this game', 'they really made attacking th15 more userfriendly introducing new troop dang', 'subscribe for all the update sneak peek which root rider strategy will you use', '', 'town hall playlist', 'super wall breaker would vanished from some extent', 'but loved see new troop new townhall', 'expect nerf coming soon even though not_ yet officially released this new troop definitely overpowered', 'feel like lot older troop are left out valkyrie apparent one but pekka also significantly downgraded once electro titan announced they should make buff the unusable troop', 'this new troop truly amazing cannot wait try see little slow but they have unstoppable power', 'the troop pretty interesting seems kind this moment add much value hero dive without taking much space also seems superior lot popular troop like electro titan and hog interesting see how work out seems like could break bit', 'cannot wait see the root rider dominate pro game', 'think that the apprentice warden going pair really well with boost health much and not_ wrong can jump over wall not_ root rider will break them anyways', 'the extra will great value especially you use root rider attack', 'for the one who noticed two icon above the king', '', 'new blacksmith building coming have different ability for hero', 'upcoming sneak peak think will our hero ability charging option somethingmore cooler', 'much excited before seeing', 'liked the troop but think they could have game her better ability with the root manipulation concept like using the root force stop defense for limited amount time', 'think they are kind bad due their low they are more like pseudo tank that crush wall along the way and not_ prone spring trap can see them being used instead ice golem sometimes think their best use case would with super bowler smash since you would able use without jump due how good they are breaking wall', 'always first stop for all the new update information thanks judo all the video always are well designed and very informative you and the other content creator are much part the game the game itself keep friend', 'honestly feel like have really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through attack strategy with basic commentary keep judo', 'add what judo said about using super wall breaker for king pathing the root rider are just normal troop whereas the super wall breaker super troop you not_ have use your dark elixir super potion definitely looking forward this troop']",541

no way new hellogames game

i love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that nms trailers usually are
cant wait for this looks beautiful
the fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very very good thing thats a sign that theyre aiming for density on a much smaller scale despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
i genuinely cannot wait  you guys are some of the hardest working devs around and i really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making nms an incredible game im more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything i love in one game so excited
seeing how far theyve come with nms compared to its initial release makes this game very promising even if its not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning we no theyre 100 capable of making it better over time
as a nms player since day one im all in for light no fire
after the eventual epic success of nms hello games is now one of the few game developers i trust to deliver i cant wait to explore this world
i like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year i am genuinely excited for this i can see this being a huge improvement from nms for the simple reason its just one world which they can build on density
having witnessed the commitment they have shown to no mans sky im all in on this also no mans sky on psvr2 is insane
love the artstyle looks really interesting and after delivering nms you really deserve that this will be a success
what im hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards and some kind of engaging story if they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
everything about this is pure vibes the atmosphere the track selection for the video the editing very well done cannot wait to play this
i dont even know how i feel no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre and you guys delivered that  cant wait
i just want to say im a huge fan of your guys work you guys put passion first and money second unlike the vast majority of companies today

hopefully tatum finally gets to heal for most people who had toxic parents after they die they get to finally close that chapter and retrieve their lives i really really hope tatum soars and is finally at peace free from all that toxicity 
im glad ryan and tatum got to take that photo together after so many years everything came full circle after the drama in their lives rip ryan
condolences to ryans family especially tatum and redmond

 he was a very good actor and will be missed
done well to reach 82yrs rip we all have our struggles to deal with no one is perfect  papermoon is timeless classic
i always wished i could chat with tatum about her dad its tough to have a parent thats an alcoholic and is emotionally distant from you especially when he divorces your mother and you feel like youve been replaced despite all of that i hope in the end they were able to mend their relationshipnot just for his sake but for hers as well carrie fischer once quoted her famous mother saying resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die my wish for them both is that they forgave each other for whatever and were able to say i love you before it was too late
my sincerest condolences to ryans family and friends  i loved him in love story so sad to see our childhood icons move on to another plain rest in peace 
death comes at any time for anyone we have to be prepared for our final hour we are immortal only the body dies the soul lives forever i hope he finds peace
i feel so sad for his children  my condolences for all the grieving they have gone through 
i still remember sitting in the movie theater and sobbing    along with a lot of other teenage girls in the audience  love story   something about the music film locations and cast that  were timeless

condolences to ryans family especially tatum and redmond he was a very good actor and will be missed
i would like to give my condolences to the family of ryan oneal he was an outstanding actori did not see every movie that he made but i seen a number of themrip mr oneal
i actually feel sorry for tatum more than anything
i worked on a movie with him as a crew member he was nothing but professional wanting to do his best performancelike he wanted the glory of love story i felt sorry for him on many levels noticing how hard he was on himself after a take second guessing himself and genuinely trying to give his best performance rest in piece mr o niel
death is always sadsometimes a welcomed release but sad my love goes out to his family rest in peace ryan
my heart goes out to tatum its hard when a parent dies and leaves things unresolved with you much like tatum provably felt you wait a lifetime for that person to change because no matter what else they are they are still your latent sadly i know this too well
aside from him as a father and person i think he was a fabulous actor and he made wonderful movies my heart goes out to poor tatum i hope she found some kind of closure with her father
i always admired him as an actor its a shame he wasnt a very good father his children really suffered because of it i hope they can put it behind them and heal now
he was one of the greatest actors of our time rest in power 
mr onesl   and  thank you
ryan was an honorable actor his private life didnt fit the same category we are not perfect parents i am so happy the family was able to reunite and reconcile their past for the most part my thoughts and prayers go out to his sons and especially tatum i always worry about her i pray to god she is able to get some peace finally she definitely deserves it i also experienced a bad abusive childhood but when my dad closed his eyes he took all of that with him so i really hope that she can gain just a fraction of some hope here one thing for sure ryan fiercely fought the last 23 years of his life i gotta hand it to him hes really strong im praying and thinking of you tatum all of your fans are we hope youre recuperating well from your stroke too 
we are all sending our thoughts and prayers out to the family at this difficult time  rip ryan

minecraft secretlife",874,"the fact that i watched cleos pov first and nothing  grian did struck out of the ordinary other than when grian asked etho what he ate for breakfast i thought that was weird but nothing else until i saw this
jimmy somehow manages to weasel his way back in 
out of everyone to be paired together jimmy with grian is the best because now jimmy can torment grian freely
jimmy and grian are such brothers i swear i love seeing them interact and seeing jimmy get so excited to mess with grian is always so funny
ethos task must have been jimmy is telling grian what to do act as if everything is completely normal
this is honestly such a good representation of jimmys quick wit every sort of situation grian was in he managed to find something hilarious for him to do
grian sounded really panicked  as soon as he found out lol 
 the ghosts all stay above the clouds and watch 
whoa jimmy you just created lore
this is the furthest that jimmy has ever made it in a life series he may not be there in physical form but hes there in spirit
i like how timmy tries to embarrass grian but it backfires
the absolute sheer joy jimmy had doing this is absolutely making my day
forcing someone to be weird on this server literally has no effect  people have been weird since day one  ethos first episode here was titled server full of weirdos
i would love to see a future installment of the life series use a gimmick where dead players can stick around as guardian angels for the living players
when the world needed him the most he came back
funny how the secret keeper allowed jimmy back as a ghost instead of letting rejoin in a different name with a mustache just like in the hardcore series grian did with scar and joel 
seeing an episode from spectator mode is actually really fun not to mention this particular task was fantastic
knowing ethos strategy has been to do weird things so people couldnt guess his task he probably just assumed grian was doing the same thing on top off etho just being a chill person in general and not minding other peoples business too much
the leaves are all pointing upward
etho and cleo appear out of nowhere
kinda cute that jimmy used grian to woof at martyn from beyond the grave
observation jimmy spent most of the time just kinda playing around with grian but the instant genuine danger gets presented to him he drops the light tone and warns him

a tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
this is an awesome turn for the channel and they dont even always have to be death matches they could be races to loot or securing an area team death matches would be a treat too
the animation team did a fantastic job and congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
as an animator myself ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew  theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics ive seen hollywood do far worse

props allround  super keen to see more of these styles of videos
as someone who loved watching the most extreme as a kid on animal planet i appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly the only thing missing was the music used in the show
dang the fight choreography was so good all the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging the cat noticing the raptor the bluffing the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points

such good work
i didnt realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content incredible work
the animation on this episode is exceptional kudos to kuzim and wobblyworks
ive always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a cg character believable and id say this is proof of that
i love this so much as a big fan of the iconic animal face off series back in the day its nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback awesome stuff as always
the animations here are crazy cool  hoping to see more in the future
this channel has been great the whole time its existed and the skill going into production has been increasing thanks for existing
im a longtime fan of kuzims art and its so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel
wow such a good pilot this gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on tv but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe congratulations to the whole team

i just missed your gaming guide style of writing this one was professional succinct and great but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction
sadly i dont think these videos will hit your normal view count but please dont stop making them the series from this would be amazing and will blow up great job on the animation from your team
at first i was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality fearing they finally dropped the ball on outsides legendary graphics but then i realized this is a user made mod made from scratch not bad at all and a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing would love to see more content in this mod
2 years well spent this is amazing truly top tier content every single time tierzoo just doesnt disappoint
the step up in animation is phenomenal cant wait to see what you do with it next

playing against stockfish is like competing in arm wrestling against an industrial press basically
stockfish never fails to put levy in a video
this guy should make his own youtube channel about chess
stockfish be like you missed mate in 54 you filthy casual my suggested move is to never play chess again
it took him 34 moves to lose to stockfish i could do it much faster than that

so basically the answer to every single question is that stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol
i know he is an im but surviving 35 moves against stockfish is seriously impressive i wish i can survive 35 against my 1000 elo opponents
i love how gms dont even get on this all the less incentive to be one when youre more influential than most gms props gotham
just wait until they hear about mittens
i dont even see the opponents bishop on the opposite side of the diagonal let alone seeing 23 moves into the future
levy builds a youtube career roasting 500 rated bozos
stockfish exists
levy turns out the bozo was me all along

loving the gothamwired collabs
i love when levy appears in a video he didnt upload because the title and thumbnail actually tells you what to expect
this video is so good on so many levels its one thing to discuss the capability of a computer its another thing to be able explain to the common person why this computer is so good and to make the whole explanation so interesting add levys humor and his ability to explain things very well mix that with all that the wired editorial staff can bring to the table and its just wow this content is just friggin awesome thanks all involved
human performs opening move

stockfish after considering half a billion possibilities in a million different realities i will play knight to f6 
to think there was a time when we thought it would be impossible to ever teach a computer to play chess competitively against people  until deep blue beat the best of us
the fact alpha zero made stockfish look silly after only 4 hours of learning chess by playing against itself is both fascinating and scary at the same time
levys so good they can bring him on to interview someone else and the video is still awesome
as someone whos very interested in the world of machine learning and has looked into how stockfish works its cool seeing a video covering the fundamental concepts like this i hope we get more videos like this",24,Entertainment,10800000,PT9M54S,"['thanks again wired more collabs 2024', 'playing against stockfish like competing arm wrestling against industrial press basically', 'stockfish never fails put levy video', 'this guy should make his own youtube channel about chess', 'stockfish like you missed mate you filthy casual suggested move never play chess again', 'took him move lose stockfish could much faster than that', 'gothamchess wired thank you for having talk about computer chess been one passion for long time and much fun discus with you', 'basically the answer every single question that stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol', 'know but surviving move against stockfish seriously impressive wish can survive against 1000 elo opponent', 'love how not_ even get this all the incentive one when you are more influential than most prop gotham', 'just wait until they hear about mitten', 'not_ even see the opponent bishop the opposite side the diagonal let alone seeing move into the future', 'levy build youtube career roasting 500 rated bozo', 'stockfish exists', 'levy turn out the bozo all along', '', 'loving the gothamwired collabs', 'love when levy appears video did not_ upload because the title and thumbnail actually tell you what expect', 'this video good many level one thing discus the capability computer another thing able explain the common person why this computer good and make the whole explanation interesting add levy humor and his ability explain thing very well mix that with all that the wired editorial staff can bring the table and just wow this content just friggin awesome thanks all involved', 'human performs opening move', '', 'stockfish after considering half billion possibility million different reality will play knight', 'think there time when thought would impossible ever teach computer play chess competitively against people until deep blue beat the best', 'the fact alpha zero made stockfish look silly after only hour learning chess playing against itself both fascinating and scary the same time', 'levy good they can bring him interview someone else and the video still awesome', 'someone who very interested the world machine learning and looked into how stockfish work cool seeing video covering the fundamental concept like this hope get more video like this']",594

sarz gunna asake newmusic",1667,"sarz is definitely one of the best producers in the world steady taking the sonical level of the afrobeats genre to greater heights with each drop
asake thanks for sticking to your style and language 
the only problem with this song is that it ends
if you are here in 2090 i was here in 2023
asake was a young artist who came from grass to
grace he was among the best musicians of his generation  he was a living legend
in 2023 nigerian music was doing absolutely well getting even better everyday and it was loved worldwide we nigerians were proud of this success story
hope the world is a better place in 2090 stay safe and be a nice human
wow i did even expect gunna would follow up the beat with his own verse 
when talent is at its best no one can stop it big up to everyone watching this masterpiecemuch love from uganda 
lets not forget to also appreciate the producers they are the architects behind these great songs 
as a music producer deeply immersed in the rich tapestry of african rhythms i extend heartfelt gratitude to the nigerian music community for their instrumental role in propelling amapiano the vibrant south african genre to remarkable heights this collaboration is a monumental stride for african music on the global stage

amapiano with its unique blend of deep house jazz and lounge music infused with luscious piano melodies and lowtempo beats has found a resonant harmony within the nigerian music scene this synergy has not only enriched the genres texture but also expanded its reach and influence affirming the power of african musical heritage in shaping global soundscapes

this crosscultural fusion exemplifies the dynamic everevolving nature of african music and underscores the continents collective potential in forging new frontiers in the global music industry as we witness amapianos ascent its a testament to the unifying power of music and the endless possibilities that emerge when diverse african musical traditions converge and collaborate

i love how blacks literally support each other to grow and be a burst of sunshine again oh mama africa i cant wait to see you prosper and well africa
ive looped this to an unhealthy number of times might not get all the lyrics but im feeling every note mob love from nairobi kenya 
this is what happens when afrobeats meets hiphop  a beautiful array of colors love and vibe

just realized paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady  shes basically a drone
i just hope furina gets the well deserved hug that she didnt receive
would be so cool if navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  
furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished love that for her

this special program is the second one that actually made my day and zhonglis art at the last seconds of this program made me internally scream  cant wait for two online concerts and a new album of characters osts 
this patch for tcg is the closest well get to signora being a playable character
thank you dev team for all those system optimizations we appreciate you 
im smiling for this genshin baby
damn furinas ptsd kicking in with the word wave is so on point and i love how she is happy now
furina being a director cries she seems so happy i love her its so grest she gets to do what she loves and be free now and the film event looks amazing litterly looks like the mostfun version ever 
out of all the news shared im definitely hyped that we finally get to grace our ears with wanderers theme with stellar moments vol4 outside of his character demo and covers

i am absolutely certain that if 1 of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did regardless of what that may be to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place
thank you james for encouraging people through coffee to do more do better and question what they do
the reason youre not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process no idea the details of how the machine works but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains
its fascinating that the spritzing makes a measurable difference to the extraction of the espresso i could totally see well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality itll probably never mean anything but its amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful quantitative change
i love the citizen science your channel is promoting and that youre encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared there is a signal here we just cant see it yet keep sharing keep signal boosting and keep experimenting
if you close your eyes you can experience what its like to have jon hamm describe coffee physics to you
i think when collecting data from lots of people tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important i keep my house really dry 30 for 3d printing and i see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder which doesnt have any bottleneck so rh may be a significant source of noise

its always a pleasure to watch these videos and even more of a pleasure to watch james slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago  somehow forgot that id since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat  while i cant endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real proustian moment while i played what the hell is that weird perfume flavor
my suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed which usually i would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry the oils in the coffee also probably dont help with that if you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference so a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates this is not contrary to what the prof said it might be a combination of both
even though im not that into coffee and usually just guess each time i make it i absolutely love your videos its not just the information but the candor the dedication without obsession and the curiosity i wish there were clones of you making youtube videos on different topics  itd be a better world
this is fascinating  theres a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee  ive been freezing beans for freshness since i use coffee pretty slowly  an unintended result is that when i take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold  its like getting a mist and mix for no effort  hard to control the amount which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room but interesting nonetheless  ive also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my breville barista express or my fellow ode gen 1 and not surprisingly ive had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders
man this video is surreal i dont think i ever had a chance to meet him specifically but i was just at a small conference with chris hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research i dont think ive ever seen someone ive encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this i suspected that he or his work about coffee though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry would show up here eventually though super exciting stuff
i am super excited that you got a particle size analyzer and from a legit analytical science company like anton paar that is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders burrs grind rpm etc which so far has been limited to assumptions wow that instrument is a significant investment too and im thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune so to speak can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere

im assuming well be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument cant wait 
i used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published my grinder is the new fellow opus it was the first time i did it with the opus because i never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech and i was so surprised that when wet it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when its dry now that this paper has been published im going to try it again
james i would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind my theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators i think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders  the eureka mignon oro has a metal spout and cup
i just tried spritzing for pour over coffee there was less static cling which was nice i also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower i only did it once so it could be a fluke
well done chris and his fellow authors as well as you james what shocks me is that there isnt more science on how to improve the taste of coffee probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively but there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques

i lost my wife earlier this year she would have loved this song i shed tears of somberness and loneliness this christmas thank you for releasing this song simon
xg is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained  honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly
what an instant bop for this season
xg brings soul back in music they sing with their heart every word they say every note they sing every choreo there are soulful sincere message in it i hope they keep on doing what they doing they are making the right choice there are a lot of us who understand real music talented artists weve been waiting for a group like you our whole life the fanbase keeps getting bigger i saw new reactors everyday they been saying you are their favorite group so keep going xg hesono ooooo
they really need to play this on radio in all over the us
my great grandpa passed away in october its been really hard for me and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this christmas thanks xg for your amazing new song 
i wish xg would release a full length album with 1314 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts
the gals need some radio play for this song its such a good song and deserves more people to know before christmas
toda vez que escuto novamente meu corao vibra de uma maneira diferente obrigada xg 
i lost my mom this year this song made me think of her since she loved christmas 
the more i listened to the song the more it hit harder also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated christmas for so long because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that this song was so meaningful thank you xg xgalx the creators behind it so much for making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young  and yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 



its sad how underrated this group is
they slayed every genre
not only noisy music and dances
cocos voice so warm and smooth  i can listen to her forever 
jurias make me emotional
mayas and hinatas voices are so pretty im happy they did a lot of singing here
chisa always killing it
jurins and harveys parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time

love them sooo sooo much
i really want to meet the person who produceswrites their stuff it is so authentically american 90s to early 2000s rb its crazy kpop often chases black culture awkwardly but these girls truly pay so much hommage to it in such an authentic way its so amazingly beautiful also harveythat outfit at 333  i cant girl stopplease my heart 
the beauty of the song the amazing vocals the rap production the beautiful harmonies everything is perfect

mannn that was so fun your base looks so cool i really hope no one finds it from this video thatd be unfortunate xd
very cool video fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one
rekrap2 just wanted to let you know since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the target block and target fluid on the bottom right since they show exact coords
rekrap2 just letting you know if you want to properly blur your coordinates you also need to blur the chunk coordinates which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks edit after trying to figure out if you gave info away i have found that you did block it sorry
seeing rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
hey rek its amazing to see how much youve grown over the past couple of years form ecocraft to lifesteal then the race to 1m with parrot then to commentary speed runs hoplite and so much other amazing content thank you so much for entertaining me over the years
im so happy that you made this video i enjoy watching these types of  thanks rek keep up the good work 
watching secret life has made me extra anxious watching anyone playing on a server i especially skipped a beat when the meteor dropped on your head lol
edit this was a really fun video
you have to make this a series its soo good

new ecosystems new creatures a mount that lets you glide from high falls everything from this trailer brought me joy and i absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar
so excited  
this is what i always wanted to see in monster hunter large flocks of animals more ambiant megafauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs

it will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem cant wait to see what they cook up for us
as a fiver it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of monster hunter i am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
ill let it speak for itself is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement you know that monster hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds
the amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster and rath ofc is actually stunning to me didnt think they had it in them
seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment as well as one another has got me feeling the same giddiness i had seeing the monster hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time this franchise is in my blood man
one of my friends got me into mh back when world was announced i played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hours combined later this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time heres to hunting with everyone in 2025 lets go
heres the most anticipated game for me until it comes out very hard to top it from my list 
mhw have such a special place in my gamer heart
this looks amazing it gives me very open worldish vibes i would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting exploring and researching kinda vibe
the little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic
from that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in the synth stuff being used is really new to mh or at least it hasnt had a very large presence they mainly kept to orchestration

but all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme

truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack
mhw was my first introductory into the franchise it became and still remains my favorite game ever and i started at the base nintendo system this game just brought joy to my heart
love the little bit they showed here the movement feels like a mix of worlds more methodical speed and rises more open verticallity
i absolutely loved worlds ecosystem simulation and i absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game
i thought you couldnt get better than the palamutes i was so wrong though the mounts different movement types kinda make me think of koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mounts from scarlet and violet its a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great i love this creature and i want twelve of them
bro when i was going into the game awards i had the lowest of low expectationsbut then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interestedand then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me i am hyped beyond belief even if 2025 is quite a long wait i am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon
i want them to bring back 16 person hubs so much more lively for my 712 person groups it felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world
one of my friends got me into monster hunter my first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cant wait to see what the new game brings 
im reaching that phase in my life where i really dont feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited ",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S,"['hunter take care yourselves all make 2025 and play this amazing game together', 'new ecosystem new creature mount that let you glide from high fall everything from this trailer brought joy and absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this stellar', 'excited', 'this what always wanted see monster hunter large flock animal more ambiant megafauna and large monster type being able encountered hunting pack', '', 'will feel lot more like massive ecosystem cannot wait see what they cook for', 'fiver really surreal experience here for the next generation monster hunter absolutely stoked see what store for', 'ill let speak for itself one the best thing you could say game announcement you know that monster hunter iconic that player could immediately recognize second', 'the amount restraint they had only showing one new large monster and rath course actually stunning did not_ think they had them', 'seeing the way the small monster interact with the environment well one another got feeling the same giddiness had seeing the monster hunter test footage mounting and climbing wall for the first time this franchise blood man', 'one friend got into back when world announced played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hour combined later this the most exciting announcement for such long time here hunting with everyone 2025 let', 'here the most anticipated game for until come out very hard top from list', 'mhw have such special place gamer heart', 'this look amazing give very open worldish vibe would love see monster hunter move more towards this style that really push the boundary true hunting exploring and researching kind vibe', 'the little bit soundtrack get this trailer just legitimately fantastic', 'from that deep synth bass the start which then punctuated some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral part kicking the synth stuff being used really new least not_ had very large presence they mainly kept orchestration', '', 'but all that leading into what very quickly becoming favorite rendition the proof heroesque leit motif that each game get main theme', '', 'truly excited for this game and hear more soundtrack', 'mhw first introductory into the franchise became and still remains favorite game ever and started the base nintendo system this game just brought joy heart', 'love the little bit they showed here the movement feel like mix world more methodical speed and rise more open verticallity', 'absolutely loved world ecosystem simulation and absolutely cannot wait see what they with this game', 'thought you could not_ get better than the palamutes wrong though the mount different movement type kind make think koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mount from scarlet and violet great concept already and seeing put use beautifully here great love this creature and want twelve them', 'bro when going into the game award had the lowest low expectationsbut then few game trailer came out actually got quite interestedand then this came the very last moment and stole the show for hyped beyond belief even 2025 quite long wait more than willing wait for this masterpiece come soon', 'want them bring back person hub much more lively for 712 person group felt more dynamic and lot fun when had that freedom monster hunter world', 'one friend got into monster hunter first game world and have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cannot wait see what the new game brings', 'reaching that phase life where really not_ feel like investing much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited']",91

which characters are you hoping to see on the roster
who else is ready for one of the biggest and best fighting experiences to date rip all controllers
its like the fusion of dbz kakarot and dbfz in terms of animation  this is gonna be 
please i hope we get a huge roster like the old games and they dont lock a bunch of them behind paywalls
its absolutely crucial to feature local multiplayer for a fighting game not having this is a deal breaker for many people myself included i have so many great couch memories with the old tenkaichi 2 and 3 split screen battles  please make it happen
ive played budokai tenkaichi literally most of my life and now were finally getting another one we are so back
dont lock characters behind dlc and pay wallslet us unlock the roster
im hoping theyll have a lot of og db characters on the roster would love to play as piccolo jr or kid goku from the path to power movie
i find myself constantly rewatching this trailer in disbelief that a new budokai tenakichi is being made its crazy i still have play bt3 and rb2 to this day and a another is actually being made its soo surreal man thank god i lived to see this
no wonder why they took so long they wanted to make sure they did it right  incredible
no words can express
how much i been waiting for a entry in the budokai series in a very long time without this series i wouldnt have been a fan of dragon ball z or anime in general
ive genuinely done nothing but cry this past 2 days

i just cant stop thinking about this being alive to experience tenkaichis return and it being so glorious
ive been watching this trailer at least twice a day since it was announced its amazing and i hope its well worth the wait
this trailer showed me almost everything i need to know about the game play to be excited but please dont forget one of the things that made tenkaichi special was the uniquely cinematic character intros and the roster that included faces even harcore fans occasionally forget 

seeing bergamo helped but i would love to see this roster include more dragon ball and dragon ball gt characters like jackie chun king chappa ledgic and goku jr
i really hope they go all out on this for roster tenkaichi 3 was so crazy i want everyone from the pilaf gang and grandpa gohan to meta rildo and orange piccolo if the character has thrown a punch i want them in
better have a hercule with infinite combo like in budokai tenkaichi 2
also 12 arcade mode like in 2 or 3 would be awesome

ff7r ps5",3158,"this game is gonna make me shed so many tears and i am so here for it cant wait for february already who else preordered
god that last shot of aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds
cids voice sounds great cant wait to see more of him in this game
the thing im looking forward to the most is the dyne plot line it seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around and barret was already so good in remake
this game is literally the only reason im going to buy a ps5 in the original midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game i cant wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror
aeriths new white dress is so pretty did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral
so excited for this game
props to loren alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game truly magnificent 
so niceeeeee cid and vincent in the party cloud and aerith barrets storythe gold saucer and marlene there with cloud and zack so insane looking forward to playing the second part
im emotional already who knew the impact and trauma ffvii would cause a whole generation
cid was one of my favorite characters in the original ff7 cant wait to play as him again in this remake
i love aerith so much i teared up beautiful song 
i love dynes voice well everyone looks amazing
oh my gosh cloud and aerith just two inches away from each other 
i still have phantom pain from 26 years ago that last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th time
this is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers  and i dont think its going to end the way we suspect  it wont be smiles and rainbows but i dont think aerith is going to die either  if she did then it would beg the question of what this was all for  we know this isnt a true remake but a sequel to the original game  the true remake is ever crisis
quite possibly the greatest game ever made
i nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer im not ready for this i just want to see these characters i grew up with have a happy ending but i know the journey of rebirth wont be an easy one final fantasy for life
nobuo uematsu is truly a legend he just knows how to make music fit the themes of final fantasy games so well cant have final fantasy without nobuo you just cant this song may possibly be the signature theme of ffvii games from now on the ending for ff vii is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this im looking forward to when that day comes
just when i thought my hype couldnt get any bigger i havent even played this game yet and i can already tell its going to be one of my favorite games of all time
one of my favorite trailers ever this is gonna be a masterpiece",20,Gaming,172000,PT2M37S,"['this game going make she would many tear and here for cannot wait for february already who else preordered', 'god that last shot aerith praying black feather fall around her reopening old wound', 'cid voice sound great cannot wait see more him this game', 'the thing looking forward the most the dyne plot line seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around and barret already good remake', 'this game literally the only reason going buy ps5 the original midgar just feel like prologue the actual game cannot wait see how this one compare that feeling when the world open and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with side horror', 'aeriths new white dress pretty did anyone else notice that decorated with the same yellow flower she grows the cathedral', 'excited for this game', 'prop loren alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release the game truly magnificent', 'niceeeeee cid and vincent the party cloud and aerith barrets storythe gold saucer and marlene there with cloud and zack insane looking forward playing the second part', 'emotional already who knew the impact and trauma ffvii would cause whole generation', 'cid one favorite character the original ff7 cannot wait play him again this remake', 'love aerith much teared beautiful song', 'love dyne voice well everyone look amazing', 'gosh cloud and aerith just two inch away from each other', 'still have phantom pain from year ago that last shot opened wound again for like the 7777th time', 'this going the cliffhanger end all cliffhanger and not_ think going end the way suspect will not_ smile and rainbow but not_ think aerith going die either she did then would beg the question what this all for know this not_ true remake but sequel the original game the true remake ever crisis', 'quite possibly the greatest game ever made', 'nearly she would tear seeing this trailer not_ ready for this just want see these character grew with have happy ending but know the journey rebirth will not_ easy one final fantasy for life', 'nobuo uematsu truly legend just know how make music fit the theme final fantasy game well cannot have final fantasy without nobuo you just cannot this song may possibly the signature theme ffvii game from now the ending for vii definitely gona 10x more emotional with this looking forward when that day come', 'just when thought hype could not_ get any bigger have not_ even played this game yet and can already tell going one favorite game all time', 'one favorite trailer ever this going masterpiece']",157

tyler and bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots they endured sitingstanding in a wall and floor for 3 hours
jt fan favourite the insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though especially when james said how disgusting that would be like whats coming next year hiding in the septic tank
jt hiding in plain sight was awesome
funniest has to be jt and andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while james goofed around with his card trick but tyler and bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure hard to pick between the 2 though
wow lots of good hiding spots this year

its be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in
honestly tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening but tylers had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile
im surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid i was most impressed with jt hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently
someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year
if the hacksmith industries ever move to another building the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property
the insulation hiding spot was 200iq when james pulled out the thermal camera i thought he is not going to find that person with the camera
i love how much team work they put in and i love how often james walked past some people in plain sight lol
jt hiding was the best ive ever seen dude was just sitting there like nobodys business while james was running around legendary
i really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building this is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever
jts hiding spot deserves commendation james was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
this looks like so much fun despite the highpressure work environment and the demands of producing youtube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech yall still manage to bring your a game to hideandseek great job
jt hiding right in front james at the desk was by far the best even though he got caught eventually
i feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings
if i had a nickel for every time i saw a youtube based company playing hide and seek with their employees i would have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened right
jt keeping his cool with james leaning over his shoulder was absolutely the best that said tylers hole in the floor was prolly the most effective spot",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT21M1S,"['sitting just few centimeter away from james insane just hiding plain sight legendary', 'tyler and bogdan definitely had the best hiding spot they endured sitingstanding wall and floor for hour', 'fan favourite the insulation the best hiding spot opinion though especially when james said how disgusting that would like what coming next year hiding the septic tank', 'hiding plain sight awesome', 'funniest and andreas hiding plain sight the office while james goofed around with his card trick but tyler and bogdan had the best hiding spot for sure hard pick between the though', 'wow lot good hiding spot this year', '', 'shame someone secretly spent all year digging hole with trapdoor somewhere hide', 'honestly tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot all bogden cut wall had some form opening but tyler had absolutely telling that altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile', 'surprised that many hid from thermal camera and left little clue where they hid most impressed with hiding plain sight and how long pulled off with eye him frequently', 'someone need incorporate hiding spot project and sit for month just win next year', 'the hacksmith industry ever move another building the next occupant will find unusual amount hidey hole and secret passage throughout the entire property', 'the insulation hiding spot 200iq when james pulled out the thermal camera thought not_ going find that person with the camera', 'love how much team work they put and love how often james walked past some people plain sight lol', 'hiding the best have ever seen dude just sitting there like nobody business while james running around legendary', 'really wish other company understood the importance this kind team building this the kind stuff that make memory and employee will talking about future job about how they used work for the coolest company ever', 'jts hiding spot deserves commendation james stood next him and had goddamn idea', 'this look like much fun despite the highpressure work environment and the demand producing youtube content while simultaneously designing and building some the coolest tech you all still manage bring your game hideandseek great job', 'hiding right front james the desk far the best even though got caught eventually', 'feel like someone who want win this should plan super far ahead build spot early the year that people get used seeing whatever change are made the surroundings', 'had nickel for every time saw youtube based company playing hide and seek with their employee would have two nickel which not_ lot but weird that happened right', 'keeping his cool with james leaning over his shoulder absolutely the best that said tyler hole the floor probably the most effective spot']",1261

globalnews canada cdnpoli",2158,"maybe they should do the same with immigration i dont understand how we will support the influx of 500k per year when there is already a lack of housing health careetc for canadians
it would be a mistake to blame international students for the housing crisis you got that right you the government are to blame not international students
i cannot understand why our  government has more concern and compassion  and wanting the international  students to thrive  then their own citizens  going forward lets start offer solutions  so  canadian citizens   thrive and just not  survive
they need to bring their own support here the tax payers cant be held liable to support immigrants the money needs to be going to our canadian veterans and families in need the colleges are making an obscene amount of money from international students and they can provide them with the knowledge on how to get on in canada they are literally an education institution
so we can ensure international students are set up for success in canada

what are you doing to ensure canadians are set up for success in canada our leaders are a joke on both sides of the aisle
so youre gonna find affordable housing for international students but keep ignoring the problem for canadians
canada have to invest and support its own canadian citizen students  not in foreign student
it feels like the government cares more about international students than canadians who have lived here their entire lives
enough is enough  we are tired of our own policies ruining our country   liberal government
i immigrated to canada via being international students then work then immigrate let me tell you its not an easy route and it has a lot of limitations i took a ton of coop to ensure i will have good job opportunity when i graduate i also spent more than 100k in tuition alone im grateful for this path and privilege its disgusting to see some international students scamming the system and going to food banks the purpose of international students is to boost our economy better our university equipment and staff its not to burden the society when i applied decades ago i couldnt work more than 20 hours i have to renew my permit every year or two prove i have enrolled in full time school show them my grade and sufficient financial support they expect you to have at least 10k in cash sitting around untouched 

how d f we got to this point why would we even have international student going to food back send them home if they cant afford ive done it its a privilege not right
international students are coming for the betterment of themselves they are taking the jobs that our homeless and youth should be getting now we hear of forien students going to food banks to provide more for themselves and its free canada should not be responsible for delivering proper education for international students while our own need assistance
i like how he says he wants international students to thrive but never mentions canadians hahaha
universities are meant for the majority of canadian kids  its ridiculous that in some universities overseas student get class preference just because they pay more in fees  its not right or fair that canadian children young adults are missing out on class spaces due to this  what are provincial governments doing about this 
as a student i was offered inadequate living conditions at inflated prices and i am not an international student i am from here
our social security nets should not be able to be accessed by foreigners 

they should be for our citizens only
the canadian government is making a big mistake by giving so many student visas hundreds of thousands the short gain in tuition fees will be paid by the next generations of canadian citizens the reality is that all these foreign students the majority from india are using the visas to become residents of canada when they take the jobs of canadians and they bring more of their relatives it will be too late to close the door immigration should be regulated gradual and selective
canadian students born in canada can barely afford their living costs and tuition and none cares but the government is more concerned about international students before their own its truly sad
one thing to consider if some people have not realized yet is that the largest canadian colleges not universities are essentially diploma mills that bring in hundreds of thousands of international students into the country each year a lot of these 1to2year college diplomas are just a piece of paper with many classes consisting of 75 international students as a secondgeneration immigrant i favor halting fraudulent student visas which some politicians have suggested the cost of giving oligarchs their much loved cheap labor to work under horrible conditions is a price everyone is paying dearly for it lowers salaries across the board makes standard work conditions worse and promotes fraud all because these desperate entitled people sometimes lying on their application and pretending to be students will accept anything to stay or become prs international students may pay taxes and subsidize domestic tuition but the broader long term economic implications they have is contributing to the crises were experiencing in this country rising cost of living severe lack of affordable housing overcrowded healthcare etc and you wonder why people arent having children if were going to allow more immigrants we need more skilled labour or people who will study something useful and who will actually integrate with the rest of canadian society leaders and politicians are just as much to blame if not more
agreed  very well said its time to put a cap on the number of students coming in canada if the country doesnt have enough housing then they should limit the students to come this is the reason why landlords are increasing rents due to high demands
no international students until our own people are all housed this is insane",25,News & Politics,3970000,PT1M37S,"['maybe they should the same with immigration not_ understand how will support the

sales from merch will support all life members who opted in",2915,"the leaves are all pointing upwards is a killer quote
etho unknowingly roasting jimmy while hes listening is just pure comedic perfection xd
the cutoff immediately when martin says when is that ender pearl gonna is golden
i think jimmy confused guardian angel with intrusive thoughts personified
joels for the bad boys hurts way more when you consider that he didnt know jimmy was there it was like a moment of them all working together again in a weird little way my heart
grian cleo and etho are like the most wholesome trio that grian had in the entire life series hhahahaha i love it doing that zombie dance without hesitation hahaha
i love how the leaves are all pointing upwards somehow manages to sound so menacing even though it means absolutely nothing
gems little yes when they said the berry bushes got them was so cute the reds this season arent even scary theyre adorable
etho and cleo simply not reacting to grians strangerthannormal behaviour is so based they got this
what ive realized from this video is that jimmy has a brain made for content like the amount of things he did that made this video so many levels of entertaining is genius
them having tasks for the people who died early so they still have funcontent is actually so cute
im super appreciative of the fact that the captions in this video are different colors depending on who is talking thank you
now i kinda wanna see an smp where everyone has a secret spectator buddy
etho and cleo listening to grians weird requests and not thinking or asking twice before doing them for him perfect
jimmys reaction to ethos casual reaction to itsa me was so funny
timmy is forgetting that everyone just embraces the weirdness in this series after 8 episodes
the curse of timmy is contagious he guides grian and grian loses so many hearts turns red and loses even more hearts
crazy how i watched 11 other perspectives and didnt think for a minute that grian was acting weird
the for the bad boys was timed real well with the fact that timmy is guiding grian

while it didnt happen in a lab or on a test stand it was absolutely a test what we did with this second flight will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing starship 

the test achieved a number of major milestones helping us improve starships reliability as spacex seeks to make life multiplanetary the team at starbase is already working final preparations on the vehicles slated for use in starships third flight test 

congratulations to the entire spacex team on an exciting second flight test of starship

follow us on xcomspacex for continued updates on starships progress",2435,"we need these streams back on youtube i need to see this on a large display
so great seeing all 33 raptor engines staying lit during the entire stage 1 ascent excellent work
i really hope you start showing the spacex launches on youtube again their are many many people who dont do social media and miss watching all the falcon launches and updates
great work to all at spacex as always
excited to see spacex making history in our lifetimes
im 67 and i remember the space program from mercury through apollo they used to wheel a tv into the classrooms so we could watchyou cant imagine how thrilled i am to see this happening spacex is just running away with the ball so happy for everyone on the project 
i love this
please bring back live launches to youtube or make a smart tv app for x so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone
this is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and cooperation long live the entire team at spacex 
the length of the flame plume is completely insane starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
it looks almost like an animation the performance of those 33 raptor engines was flawless 
it was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life thank you spacex team
106 the shutdown of the engines in a ring from the outside to the inside pure exhibitionism from spacex a true spectacle
inspiring mom always told me shoot for the stars because youll land on the moon i always think about it when i look up thank you guys for always pushing yourselves it reminds me to do the same
its amazing how close the shot at 053 looks to prior renders of starship both by spacex and by fans
the way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome well done spacex
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the spacex team 3
go for it
this gave me goosebumps i feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future thankyou spacex 
impressive epic view of liftoff the visuals from spacex have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech   looks like spacex is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles
compared to the first test flight this one was like night and day bravo spacex crew ift 3

i think itd be interesting for a video to explain if a type v civilization can do anything to combat each way the universe is destroyed
i love these anthropomorphizations of these universal forces they feel like they could be end bosses to a jrpg or something stellar like that
i remember watching the first version of this 9 years ago it is cool seeing this remade again but i find it interesting how much more of this i can understand now
interesting to see how kurzgesagt has evolved in rhe 10 years since they put out their first video on the subject which also introduced me to this channel
the art quality of this video is absolutely exceptional truly a masterpiece
this video brilliantly explores the mindboggling concept of universe destruction the mix of science and animation is topnotch making complex ideas accessible im both fascinated and slightly terrified by the possibilities

all the brawlers sound fun as hell though im surprised the 3rd brawler is for the rt trio and not the castle court yard
which brawler are you most excited for
subscribe for update sneak peeks
for larry and lawry i wish we could switch playing between them as long as both are alive also it wouldve been cool if we could choose with which one we start the match this will also be the one that respawns during the match
kairos turns a 10 minutes brawl talk into a 20 minutes analysis and i wouldnt want it any other way 30 minutes of my saturday well spent
watching kairos after brawl talk is compulsory 
333 its not that the healing is inconsistent kit heals a flat percentage of the brawlers max hp every second  the inconsistency is megs natural health regeneration
i feel like one of the l duos gadgets will let us change to the other l meaning we will be able to play as larry  the evilbad one
i think a better idea for larry and laury is that their super would make them switch out so you can have a different attack power
wasnt sandy once classified as support

update its true on the wiki it shows us that on 01232020 sandy was changed from a fighter to support he was later reclassified again to controller so kitt isnt the first legendary support just the only current one
just a quick fix there is a frame in the brawl talk where you can see mortiss gear speeds up bats by 50 great video kairos
it would be cool if for larry and lawrie you are able to change perspectives using maybe a gadget of some sorts
i like having some sort of stage hazards like the ice we havent had that since the minecarts and it adds some good variety
if they add hot zone 5v5 i hope they add a contested mechanic because having 10 people constantly coming to the zone will be more of a who reaches the zone first wins than capture and defend the zone

also the cartoon trio skins is a wierd trio
anime cat maid colette
cuphead rico
and power puff girls spike with mickey mouse pants
i think it would be fun if we had the choice to switch between laury and lawry just like how eve can switch her attack pattern by equiping star power so it would be cool if we had the sp
you can see how when edgar activates his hypercharge he doesnt get the reload buff only when he jumps with his super he starts having the red effect sign of a reload speed buff like bulls 1st star power and megs 2nd gadget
it would be fun if it would be chosen randomly if you play larry or lawrie after respawn or joining a match 
micos first star power allows him to instantly reload a shot when the bar is full
this is what brawl stars needs this update seems so polished and like a whole new fresh experience i cant wait for 5v5
i said it once and im going to say it again kairos is the man for giving us the info we need after the brawl talk man i love kairos best brawl stars youtuber",20,Gaming,1050000,PT19M55S,"['those 5v5 look absolutely insane', 'all the brawler sound fun hell though surprised the 3rd brawler for the trio and not_ the castle court yard', 'which brawler are you most excited for', 'subscribe for update sneak peek', 'for larry and lawry wish could switch playing between them long both are alive also would have been cool could choose with which one start the match this will also the one that respawns during the match', 'kairos turn minute brawl talk into minute analysis and would not_ want any other way minute saturday well spent', 'watching kairos after brawl talk compulsory', '333 not_ that the healing inconsistent kit heals flat percentage the brawler max every second the inconsistency meg natural health regeneration', 'feel like one the duo gadget will let change the other meaning will able play larry the evilbad one', 'think better idea for larry and laury that their super would make them switch out you can have different attack power', 'not_ sandy once classified support', '', 'update true the wiki show that 01232020 sandy changed from fighter support later reclassified again controller kitt not_ the first legendary support just the only current one', 'just quick fix there frame the brawl talk where you can see mortiss gear speed bat great video kairos', 'would cool for larry and lawrie you are able change perspective using maybe gadget some sort', 'like having some sort stage hazard like the ice have not_ had that since the minecarts and add some good variety', 'they add hot zone 5v5 hope they add contested mechanic because having people constantly coming the zone will more who reach the zone first win than capture and defend the zone', '', 'also the cartoon trio skin wierd trio', 'anime cat maid colette', 'cuphead rico', 'and power puff girl spike with mickey mouse pant', 'think would fun had the choice switch between laury and lawry just like how eve can switch her attack pattern equiping star power would cool had the', 'you can see how when edgar activates his hypercharge doe not_ get the reload buff only when jump with his super start having the red effect sign reload speed buff like bull 1st star power and meg 2nd gadget', 'would fun would chosen randomly you play larry lawrie after respawn joining match', 'micos first star power allows him instantly reload shot when the bar full', 'this what brawl star need this update seems polished and like whole new fresh experience cannot wait for 5v5', 'said once and going say again kairos the man for giving the info need after the brawl talk man love kairos best brawl star youtuber']",1195

kierans new character design mixed with the music was really well done
im excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around paldea hope theyre not shiny locked and you can finally get shiny sword  shield legendaries
152 i love how when the player character sends out ionos magnemite she sends the pokeball the way iono does thats a nice detail
everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary pokemon but im just glad we get to see more larry
honestly it feels like teal mask walked so that indigo disk could run looking forward to this one
350 not only am i glad darkrai is getting the attention he deserves but also challenging dialga and palkia with darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie
yes blastoise 3d model is finally fixed ive been wanting this for over 10 years his face is sculpted proper his cannons are the correct size and his shell white trim is now sculpted properly hoohs new model also looks nice
the fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries  not only does its lore look interesting but we are finally getting the majestic minogame pokemon that ive been wanting since squirtlewartortle didnt evolve into one
gen 9 isnt even over yet and im already nostalgic for it and ive been a pokemon fan since the beginning
im so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there the music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement
i love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders can we have the team star members back as well love those guys
this dlc has been amazing so far its been personally heartwarming to see familiar pokmon return and have new places to explore
im so freaking happy all the starters are coming back cant wait to find a popplio
i dont often comment on youtube videosbut im extremely excited for this one get to bring back some of my favourite pokmon i collected over the years to join me in this dlc im also excited for new pokmon to catch and explore this new area been playing since 2006 when i was 14 amazing that how pokmon games have come along the way
i hope that the catch rate for legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown paradox entei and paradox terrakion
theres so much about this trailer that im really happy about i am hyped cant wait for this to come out
one thing i seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing 

and oh man keiran looks like hes changed quite a lot i guess well have to see if theres a way to save him but it looks like hes gone villain mode or maybs just angsty rival mode

still its gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again and how the story is going to play out i mean getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too never even expected them to pull off a dialga and palkia tera raid much less give out a darkrai even though you can get one in legends arceus or bdsp if you managed to the members card last year

still all these new things are amazing

outro cover done by httpswwwyoutubecomchanneluccs0ucupsilvk8qin5byia",3004,"you know i expected it to be bad i did not expect it to take a 180 and be an awful extraction shooter thats the biggest plot twist of all time was expecting a survival game but we were given a whole dumpster surprise
we are not surprised the developers are laughing all the way to the bank for every single person that spent 40 for this
the fact this game was the most wishlisted game on steam is insane
i was pretty much expecting it to be this bad what kind of bothers me is how they marketed the game in one trailer they scripted it as to make it seem like the two players are speaking to each other using voip their usernames highlight when speaking and everything features like that get shown in trailers and then end up being non existent in the game its no wonder they deleted the old trailers from their channel ign kept them uploaded though
the fact that people had such low expectations for this and it still managed to do even worse is incredible
well done everyone for feeding this type of scams
the day before is a perfect example to never ever under any circumstances trust a trailer or pre order anything before a full release
they didnt disappoint its exactly what i expected
i wasnt waiting for this game i was waiting for this video
hey pick up some merch maybe httpsbigfryshopcom  thanks for the amazing day
just so be clear the entire city map which is not even open world is a unreal engine store asser you can get for 539
hopefully other devs see what these devs promised showed in trailers and can make the original idea into a reality
the alarms use so many resources that zombies cannot spawn in maybe if they reduce the amount of alarms from 1000 to 10 they could add 5 more zombies wow what a sad game
517 im legit crying tears of laughter great work on this man i know you were on this literally since the day before day one and love to see it come full circle i dont know if the day befores saga is finally over but always enjoy your takes on it
i had a great time watching your stream today thanks for taking one for the team so i didnt have to waste my money on absolute garbage
watched your live stream while caring for my daughter thanks for the laughs the absolute shame of this and other games they rely on our hope for something amazing and sucker people in this game deff solid bet on train wreck hence the sales it got no one wanted to miss out like watching a fight at school
something that promised so much and ended up being completely different can definitely be fit into a class action lawsuit especially this
the moment when the character running for hours and looking into sky and said  so this is what a day before feels like this is the day before that i always looking for  put tears in my eye
ill never forget how blown away i was the first time i saw the trailer i just cant believe things turned out this way
we all knew this was going to happen whats upsetting is that i wanted it to be good so that i could have a fun coop shooter with the squad because we dont really have many games like that we arent sick of my next hope of things that could be cool but probably will be really bad is ubisofts skull and bones it cant be that hard to make good games that people can play with their friends",20,Gaming,328000,PT10M28S,"['you know expected bad did not_ expect take 180 and awful extraction shooter that the biggest plot twist all time expecting survival game but were given whole dumpster surprise', 'are not_ surprised the developer are laughing all the way the bank for every single person that spent for this', 'the fact this game the most wishlisted game steam insane', 'pretty much expecting this bad what kind bother how they marketed the game one trailer they scripted make seem like the two player are speaking each other using voip their usernames highlight when speaking and everything feature like that get shown trailer and then end being non existent the game wonder they deleted the old trailer from their channel ign kept them uploaded though', 'the fact that people had such low expectation for this and still managed even worse incredible', 'well done everyone for feeding this type scam', 'the day before perfect example never ever under any circumstance trust trailer pre order anything before full release', 'they did not_ disappoint exactly what expected', 'not_ waiting for this game waiting for this video', 'hey pick some merch maybe thanks for the amazing day', 'just clear the entire city map which not_ even open world unreal engine store asser you can get for 539', 'hopefully other devs see what these devs promised showed trailer and can make the original idea into reality', 'the alarm use many resource that zombie cannot spawn maybe they reduce the amount alarm from 1000 they could add more zombie wow what sad game', '517 legit cry tear laughter great work this man know you were this literally since the day before day one and love see come full circle not_ know the day befores saga finally over but always enjoy your take', 'had great time watching your stream today thanks for taking one for the team did not_ have waste money absolute garbage', 'watched your live stream while caring for daughter thanks for the laugh the absolute shame this and other game they rely our hope for something amazing and sucker people this game deff solid bet train wreck hence the sale got one wanted miss out like watching fight school', 'something that promised much and ended being completely different can definitely fit into class action lawsuit especially this', 'the moment when the character running for hour and looking into sky and said this what day before feel like this the day before that always looking for put tear eye', 'ill never forget how blown away the first time saw the trailer just cannot believe thing turned out this way', 'all knew this going happen what upsetting that wanted good that could have fun coop shooter with the squad because not_ really have many game like that are not_ sick next hope thing that could cool but probably will really bad ubisofts skull and bone cannot that hard make good game that people can play with their friend']",628

music by epidemic sound httpwwwepidemicsoundcom  others",906,"seeing chris throw the ball at harrys mom has to be one of the wildest things ive ever seen 
bidstrup took it like a legend huge respect
editwtf i checked my phone cuz i thought this comment got 1 like 
its always a long wait for a new video from chris but when it finally arrives its a piece of cinematic gold
the video weve all been waiting for let us know if you wanna play for us soon 
to everyone in the comments check out our channel for more chris vs mads content 
i swear harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 
bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
you notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round they are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge small things but big differences
manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
chris dashing the ball at w2s mum brought it to another level 
awesome to see levi colwill in this video met him when sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against hamworthy united
the pros were all really down to earth thats cool to see
the way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
bidstrups a class guy seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to gurnsey to record that clip with harrys mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
chris is one of the best youtube football dribblers he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still wont preform the same in a charity match
crazy that bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is di maria  benfica has just won 31 salzburg
di maria scoring a corner goal absolutely insaneee
ive been watching your videos for almost 10 years now and they are always such a fun watch you still have so much authenticity which almost gives like a nostalgic feeling when i watch your videos

manchesterunited mufc",278,"he said man united would win the champions league and they didnt even make it out of their group 
imagine losing the group stage to a squad that is cheaper than antony
united fans spent the whole summer mocking liverpool fans for not getting champions league only to finish bottom of their group lol
united conceded 15 goals inside a group with galatasaray and the giant copenhagen itd be so unfair to classify even to europe league
ten hags record this season is worse than gary nevilles record at valencia 
i cannot wait until we play you guys on sunday 
masterclass from hojlund   how to avoid the ball for 95 minutes well done 
its goldbridge and chill tonight 
sad to see the underdogs finish dead last 
the notion that no other manager could do better than spending 400m and finishing bottom of a group with galatasaray and fc kobenhavn with 4 points and 4 defeats is laughable and extremely harmful and corrosive to manchester united utter mismanagement right from preseason with his training regime that has resulted in shocking fitness injuries and medical management that was a training session for bayern
bring ole back to the wheel
keep blaming the glazers for giving the manager 400m
mark owns up to his mistakes about sancho and onana but he is too obstinate to know that ten haag is a mistake too
respect to copenhagen everyone thought theyre finish last
remember ole persuaded haaland to join man utd before haaland moved to dortmund but man utd refused the contract terms
dont be sad goldstein varchester united played really well
tenhagbridge really loves ten hag

its always mctomminays fault or solskjr
its more long term to focus on hannibal instead of mctomminay because were not going to build a future midfield with mctominay anyways we have a midfielder with good enough passing and good enough ball control to be a united player in hannibal he has played for the academy and hes united as well hes more qualified to be a long term midfielder for us and he should be prioritized like other young players like garnacho if he did i think he could be a really good player for us in the future

manchesterunited mufc",1438,"david de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade i hate how he was brushed aside
ten hag in his post match said we played well and we didnt deserve to lose
i cant believe you actually thought they would win mark  with that team  we are manchester united  yep a midtable team with horrible players and management  it will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4
but mark you have to admit that other than martinez ten hags signings have been just terrible and very expensive
the problem is that because eth rates players like onana antony mount and mctominay i dont rate him
karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like its gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
figure it out eth wanted onanahe got him  not the glazers eth accountability
what does accountability of ten hag mean if a possibility of firing him isnt on the table
manchester united are the first premier league side to finish bottom of their ucl group on two occasions also 200506  record breakers also the first english side to concede 15 goals in ucl
onana has been a revelation in goala terrible revelation that ten hag has no fkin clue cheers erik
for me its mainoo simple as thatthe kids got a needle eye for a through ball and hes brave enough to attempt it we need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him we cant be playing side to side long balls all the effin time like why is this kid not constantly starting
the biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
we pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
david is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment
ten hag is sacking himself playing mctominay keep starting onana not subbing off bruno kmt if he gets the sack he deserves it  he can blame no one but himself kmt
a lot of people dont wanna hear it but bruno ruins the team its not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much either a terrible pass or a terrible shot occasionally hell slap a beauty but most of the time hes a losing factor either way hes way too risky if you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position his attitude stinks complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in honestly he has to go and mctominay 
dont get me started on mctominay
youll blame anyone and everyone other than erik ten hag for the team he manages
as you sit and listen to mark defend eths job after this just remember mark unironically believed manchester united would win the cl this season he said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had
if you go from believing we can win the competition only to come 4th in a favourable group then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable 

eth spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at lcb as an excuse for his ego trip with varane and then tonight kept him at lcb while evans played rcb he constantly talks about standards but onana who has now led us to being the english team who has conceded the most goals in a cl group stage ever got to play every game despite costing us points the sooner this guy is gone the better
i dont see why we signed bayindir when he hasnt played a game surely hes good enough to play cup games
they sanctioned onanas  deal because they believed in ten hag who is now showing us how clueless he is we need to get rid of him with the immediate effect",17,Sports,1790000,PT39M41S,"['david gae kept utd from bottom the league table for decade hate how brushed aside', 'ten hag his post match said played well and did not_ deserve lose', 'cannot believe you actually thought they would win mark with that team are manchester united yep midtable team with horrible player and management will take year get this team back even consider fighting for top', 'but mark you have admit that other than martinez ten hag signing have been just terrible and very expensive', 'the problem that because eth rate player like onana antony mount and mctominay not_ rate him', 'karma boy laughed liverpool year wait for title looking like gunna lot longer wait for are absolute mess and off the pitch', 'figure out eth wanted onanahe got him not_ the glazer eth accountability', 'what doe accountability ten hag mean possibility firing him not_ the table', 'manchester united are the first premier league side finish bottom their ucl group two occasion also 200506 record breaker also the first english side concede goal ucl', 'onana been revelation goala terrible revelation that ten hag fkin clue cheer erik', 'for mainoo simple thatthe kid got needle eye for through ball and brave enough attempt need central midfielder who can play through the space front him cannot playing side side long ball all the effin time like why this kid not_ constantly starting', 'the biggest disgrace all mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buy the player pick the team and decides what tactic play', 'pay world class wage third rate underdog', 'david laughing his off and enjoying every single moment', 'ten hag sacking himself playing mctominay keep starting onana not_ subbing off bruno kmt get the sack deserves can blame one but himself kmt', 'lot people not_ want hear but bruno ruin the team not_ just his attitude but loses the ball too much either terrible pas terrible shot occasionally hell slap beauty but most the time losing factor either way way too risky you watch him play into strike pushing our striker out their position his attitude stink complaining the player constantly when they make mistake but take accountability when make selfish play and sky the ball when shoot free kick from mile away instead whipping pas honestly and mctominay', 'not_ get started mctominay', 'you will blame anyone and everyone other than erik ten hag for the team manages', 'you sit and listen mark defend eths job after this just remember mark unironically believed manchester united would win the this season said this despite knowing who the manager and the player had', 'you from believing can win the competition only come 4th favourable group then the manager blamed and his job clearly untenable', '', 'eth spent week saying needed left footed player lcb excuse for his ego trip with varane and then tonight kept him lcb while evans played rcb constantly talk about standard but onana who now led being the english team who conceded the most goal group stage ever got play every game despite costing point the sooner this guy gone the better', 'not_ see why signed bayindir when not_ played game surely good enough play cup game', 'they sanctioned onanas deal because they believed ten hag who now showing how clueless need get rid him with the immediate effect']",2381

this looks incredible when we say we want the visuals this is what we mean 
i havent gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years  this can only be seen properly in theatre
denis villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed also the fact that theyve built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love denis and the team have for the process
this film stands as the cinematic masterpiece weve been yearning for elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights its impact on the scifi genre is unprecedented setting a new benchmark for future endeavors
but i do see a way there is a narrow way through i absolutely love the way he said that line im so excited for this movie
this film is the cinematic brilliance weve been waiting for for decades it really takes movie making to another level i really dont think there is any scifi series like this one is showing up to be
by far one of the finest movie trailer in recent years the build up is just so powerful and aweinspiring especially with the gorgeous music denis seems to have outdone himself with this one this is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope it is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years he is also the new master of intelligent and profound sciencefiction films i mean arrival blade runner 2049 dune part one dune part 2 and most probably following next will be rendezvous with rama and dune messiah an amazingly talented artist
that silence gave me serious chills i had to watch it again cant wait to see the actual scene 
this is not a movie this is pure art
how the heck does denis villeneuve deliver yet another classic that works so ridiculously well this day and age incredible i am just hoping he does more projects similar to this taking an oldie and bringing it to the modern audience
im a huge fan of the dune universe and i absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books theres also a game in development called dune awakening so i love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 
this movie franchise is a work of art love the books love everything about part i part ii is a must see
princess irulan looks like a prisoner of fate you can tell the team behind this is on the next level when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a characters costume embodies their story
yessssss    throughout the trailer i had goosebumps bigger than i have ever had clean to the end and even after   i dont think i have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does
since the first dune movie ive been obsessed best stuff that has come out of hollywood in years villeneuve and hans zimmer go hand in hand here cause it was the first time i came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score my spotify top 5 of 23 is all dune  hats off and i really look forward to dune 2 not less than how i looked forward to the return of the king 20 years ago
absolutely blown away by this trailer the visuals storyline and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters cant wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen
major goosebumps everything about this looks incredible i loved part 1 and im all in for part 2  i just wish i could watch it now
the cinematic event ive been waiting for dune will win best director editor cinematographer music costume and vfx if it doesnt then i dont know what should this is a pure labour of love i would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does cannot wait

ufc",2092,"brandon royval just casually running 10 miles at 65minute pace is impressive dude has excellent cardio
leons first nfl game was one of the worst scoring games ever  30
my takeaways from this
i am absolutely exhausted watching pantoja workout what a demon
paddy catches a lot of shit when hes away from a hot mic regarding fighting he seems like a good guy
as an american i want to apologize to leon for attending that awful fuckin nfl game
heart says wonderboy 
brain says shavkat 
watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art shit is so impressive man
tony is 06 yet i still cant wait for his appearance on the embedded

guy really is a legend and a hell of an entertainer hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens
100 respect colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class how can you not respect it
you gotta respect colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class half of the champions in the ufc or more dont fight at their normal weight class
the flash of genuine colby when they brought out the candles you could tell he loved that
you can tell that colby is a good guy and just plays a character seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter  people have to separate the ppv selling colby from the person he seems to be
still makes me sad pantoja got booed after he won the belt he left it all in the octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears dad are your proud of me now  

i like both brandon and alexandre but im rooting for alexandre
you just cant hate thompson so humble
so pumped to see colby back in action the guy is a true gem of the sport hate or love him hes thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the octagon
really rooting for colby to get it done he is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat colby twice decisively
not a colby fan but i respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport he seems to always be in fighting shape he has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
thing i love the most about colby is he doesnt cut much weight maybe 4 kilos he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
cool seeing colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment this card is gonna be a banger 
man wonderboy does not look 40 years old at all 
seeing pantoja and jds so happy and down to earth is so damn wholesome
can tell colby is actually a really good dude his manners and respect to the waiter were absolutely tops ",17,Sports,17300000,PT9M25S,"['brandon royval just casually running mile 65minute pace impressive dude excellent cardio', 'leon first nfl game one the worst scoring game ever', 'takeaway from this', 'absolutely exhausted watching pantoja workout what demon', 'paddy catch lot shit when away from hot mic regarding fighting seems like good guy', 'american want apologize leon for attending that awful fuckin nfl game', 'heart say wonderboy', 'brain say shavkat', 'watching wonderboy strike like watching painter create work art shit impressive man', 'tony yet still cannot wait for his appearance the embedded', '', 'guy really legend and hell entertainer hope this his last rodeo whatever happens', '100 respect colby right one many few fighter the roster that really doe fight his weight class how can you not_ respect', 'you got respect colby for keeping real and fighting his weight class half the champion the ufc more not_ fight their normal weight class', 'the flash genuine colby when they brought out the candle you could tell loved that', 'you can tell that colby good guy and just play character seen many interaction from him like the one with the waiter people have separate the ppv selling colby from the person seems', 'still make sad pantoja got booed after won the belt left all the octagon and that interview had grown man tear dad are your proud now', '', 'like both brandon and alexandre but rooting for alexandre', 'you just cannot hate thompson humble', 'pumped see colby back action the guy true gem the sport hate love him thoroughly entertaining camera and the octagon', 'really rooting for colby get done fighting guy that hold two win over guy that beat colby twice decisively', 'not_ colby fan but respect his decision fight his natural weight class and his overall dedication the sport seems always fighting shape point about the dagistani guy being weight bully', 'thing love the most about colby doe not_ cut much weight maybe kilo are not_ weight bully like most the other guy', 'cool seeing colby being his true self and not_ the alter ego for moment this card going banger', 'man wonderboy doe not_ look year old all', 'seeing pantoja and jds happy and down earth damn wholesome', 'can tell colby actually really good dude his manner and respect the waiter were absolutely top']",565

football rizespor ankaragucu superlig farukkoca turkey news",468,"such a massive embarrassment to the turkish people there needs to be some extremely harsh consequences for this or we will just see it replicated some time in the future this is a great example of what losing control of your emotions can result in
absolutely disgusting behaviour prison is the only place for these people
the guy that kicks him in the face while lying on the floor is even worse than the guy who threw the first punch
real men doesnt do such illmannered offensive things real men behave themselves
absolutely disgusting behavior  very immature hope all involved in the assult on the ref get arrested
he was kicked by another guy on the right as well  hope they dont miss it
the kick was worse then the punch
i hope that ref is okay
ive seen the behaviour of grassroots football in the uk and that can be quite bad 
ive havent seen anyone assaulted but its come close a few times and the abuse hurled at refs by fans players coaches can be awful
just to say that a year ago this guy took a fair play award
so cheap shots him and then someone kicks him while he is unprotected class keep watching soccer gents we dont want you in rugby games
if this happens to all leagues anthony taylor would have been dead years ago 
if it happened in england english clubs would be thrown out of every competition going it wont be dealt with the same way here though
and people wonder why we have a referee shortage
kicking a man while he is down is simply pathetic
im not condoning this behaviour as its wrong on every level but i believe theres a simple reason why it happens or why theres a strong potential for it to happen at any top level game  the reason is that theres far too much money involved in the modern game growing it into a monstrous entity worldwide  this places pressure to perform upon managers and players pressure from sponsors etc to win games and trophies  it has grown too big too fast and needs calming measures applied
before something worse than this punch happens
turkiye boyle bilinsinnustemezdik
even his captain was shocked 
the neck brace 
that hospital scene like something out of a comedy sketch that punch wouldnt have knocked over a 5 year old
very often such thuggish behaviour can be attributed to the culture of course this should not be deemed as an excuse you should have seen the crowd trouble in indonesian football stadia the players too get consumed by the events  the spectators would be wondering if they are watching a kung fu spectacle 
if the police could arrest corrupt referees people wouldnt resor to diy justice",17,Sports,262000,PT1M2S,"['such massive embarrassment the turkish people there need some extremely harsh consequence for this will just see replicated some time the future this great example what losing control your emotion can result', 'absolutely disgusting behaviour prison the only place for these people', 'the guy that kick him the face while lying the floor even worse than the guy who threw the first punch', 'real men doe not_ such illmannered offensive thing real men behave themselves', 'absolutely disgusting behavior very immature hope all involved the assult the ref get arrested', 'kicked another guy the right well hope they not_ miss', 'the kick worse then the punch', 'hope that ref okay', 'have seen the behaviour grassroots football the and that can quite bad', 'have have not_ seen anyone assaulted but come close few time and the abuse hurled ref fan player coach can awful', 'just say that year ago this guy took fair play award', 'cheap shot him and then someone kick him while unprotected class keep watching soccer gent not_ want you rugby game', 'this happens all league anthony taylor would have been dead year ago', 'happened england english club would thrown out every competition going will not_ dealt with the same way here though', 'and people wonder why have referee shortage', 'kicking man while down simply pathetic', 'not_ condoning this behaviour wrong every level but believe there simple reason why happens why there strong potential for happen any top level game the reason that there far too much money involved the modern game growing into monstrous entity worldwide this place pressure perform upon manager and player pressure from sponsor etc win game and trophy grown too big too fast and need calming measure applied', 'before something worse than this punch happens', 'turkiye boyle bilinsinnustemezdik', 'even his captain shocked', 'the neck brace', 'that hospital scene like something out comedy sketch that punch would not_ have knocked over year old', 'very often such thuggish behaviour can attributed the culture course this should not_ deemed excuse you should have seen the crowd trouble indonesian football stadium the player too get consumed the event the spectator would wondering they are watching kung spectacle', 'the police could arrest corrupt referee people would not_ resor diy justice']",62

kratos is not just the god of warbut he is nowthe god of hope
kratos the spartan the god of war and most importantly the father of boy is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts
theres something eerie about seeing a younger kratos in this modern light ive grown to love the older kratos but at the same time you are terrified of the younger kratos
the god of war becomes the god of hope i think we can all agree that kratos deserved this ending more than anything
everyones talking about young kratos and rightfully so but can we give a round of applause for tyr the fact we got to fight him not once but four times was amazing and that last encounter pure awesome
that young kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look they did great job in representing young wild kratos who still doesnt seem to understand what was going on with him at that point
if old kratos hates himself from the past you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed what an absolute legend
seeing tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more he truly has traveled a lot
kratos really came full circle he became the god of hope when all else was lost he still found hope to move on im happy to see he never forgotten pandoras words
the size difference and the different vibes young kratos and old kratos have is amazing specially when young kratos moved from his pose it was so menacing
im not gonna lie i almost teared up watching this ending

mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational

definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way
looking at this scene i cant help but think how many times i have wanted to do the exact same thing kratos did staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young selfish stupid cruel and nothing more than a lowly piece of work but then realize how far i have come in my years i needed this more than anyone could realize kratos your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that i was in tears your story one of death destruction and chaos but also of love redemption and hope you bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question who am i we are who we choose to be both of our past and of our present
love how kratos finally confronts all his regrets and it hits hard

this was such an emotional journey thank you so much to santa monica studio for this beautiful gift theyre amazing for this who agrees with me seeing young kratos meet with redeemed kratos facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light this hits home for me because i suffer with mental health disorders and seeing kratos face his younger self will be me when i recover

laufeys music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger mainstream audiences coming to the genre her sophomore album bewitched broke spotifys alltime streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platforms history and resulted in her first grammy nomination she opens the set with from the start a bouncy whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend connecting chet bakerlike scats with charming and playful lyrics taking a more melancholic turn into 2021s let you break my heart again and promise her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings creating a symphony of emotions laufey concludes the set with california and me which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by liszt and chopin this mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and musics ability to evoke raw unfiltered emotion

manchesterunited mufc",1160,"rangnick told the board two years ago what they needed to do 

sadly he was ignored
i feel like we could buy mbappe and bellingham and wed just turn them into lazy below average players
klopp wanted mount caicedo even amrabat was linked with liverpool he wanted bellingham didnt get him he bought macallister szoboszlai endo  gravenberch  got on with the job we can be complaining ten hag didnt get his targets good managers get on with the job  make it work
even the season when mourinho got the sack we qualified from the group we even beat juventus in turin no excuses for eth
all im saying is chelsea bought kepa for 80 mil they replaced him with mendy eventually its okay to make mistakes but eth does not wanna learn
erik ten hag has repeatedly said we are playing well when we arent hes either an idiot or a liar 

far less than 60 of his signings are correct

his squad selections and player treatment is dreadful 

the glazers arent going anywhere thats no excuse to keep a man who is making it all worse
rangnick had it right from the start he saw this coming we were warned but nobody took him seriously
a managers job is to get the best from his players just because a club is run poorly doesnt give the manager a free pass rather it means he has to do even better and make use of every window and the squad
i would go as far to say that the players went out on purpose to get a break mid week so they can work on their brands
every one knew that getting rid of ronaldo the way he did was going to come back to haunt him
the main issue i have with ten hagg is that i dont really see any progress around how were playing
with klopp early days they would be beaten quite a bit and finish low down the table but you could see what he was trying to do
ten haggi just have no clue

the other issue is that while i would love a massive clear out but when you have players on long term contracts who dont want to leave then there isnt much you can do
personally the club does need a huge overhaul in terms of getting rid of a bunch of players combined with very good recruitment that said though i also think eth probably needs to leave the club aswell because antony mount onana etc were his picks for the club and they have been mediocre at best
so glad mark and others have seen this fanbase for what they are yesterday fans at the park were clapping the players off and asking for autographs and handshakes ive stop blaming the glazers the players and management or even how the club is run the biggest problem is the fanbase imo standards are on the floor they would all turn up to the next home game in masses again
its on ten hag that he didnt want to have talks with rangnick or use his findings klopp met with rodgers when he took over and had talks that were useful
not so fun fact last season united lost 12 games all season after sundays game united will have 13 defeats from 25 games which stands for 52 games lost 
and were not even halfway through the season 
mic drop
mctominay is nowhere near good enough for us but i do have a certain respect for him hell play wherever hes asked give his all never complains knows hes not liked some of the far more talented players could do with that mindset
its getting crazy that when we go 2nil up im still wondering if we will concede  rather than score another
the biggest concern with the club and this extends to the manager is recruitment spending close to half a billion on new signings keeping the deadwood and basically ending up with the same team as ole is unforgivable and would only happen to man utd
at this point im lost i dont know who to blame anymore the way weve retrogressed over the years is something i wouldve never imagined 12 years ago ive never seen any big club with financial prowess and a global appeal go down this bad we are a mediocre every decision appointment signings made by this club becomes sheer mediocrity
so many people dont seem to understand marks point on eth he is saying that just changing another manager right now will make him the scapegoat and will result in keeping the players the leadership the recruitment and everyone else and will change nothing the next manager will be in the same exact position two years from now for united to become a team that is competing for the top again there needs to be a cleanout first and then bring in a new manager in better conditions",17,Sports,1790000,PT56M54S,"['rangnick told the board two year ago what they needed', '', 'sadly ignored', 'feel like could buy mbappe and bellingham and wed just turn them into lazy below average player', 'klopp wanted mount caicedo even amrabat linked with liverpool wanted bellingham did not_ get him bought macallister szoboszlai endo gravenberch got with the job can complaining ten hag did not_ get his target good manager get with the job make work', 'even the season when mourinho got the sack qualified from the group even beat juventus turin excuse for eth', 'all saying chelsea bought kepa for mil they replaced him with mendy eventually okay make mistake but eth doe not_ want learn', 'erik ten hag repeatedly said are playing well when are not_ either idiot liar', '', 'far than his signing are correct', '', 'his squad selection and player treatment dreadful', '', 'the glazer are not_ going anywhere that excuse keep man who making all worse', 'rangnick had right from the start saw this coming were warned but nobody took him seriously', 'manager job get the best from his player just because club run poorly doe not_ give the manager free pas rather mean even better and make use every window and the squad', 'would far say that the player went out purpose get break mid week they can work their brand', 'every one knew that getting rid ronaldo the way did going come back haunt him', 'the main issue have with ten hagg that not_ really see any progress around how were playing', 'with klopp early day they would beaten quite bit and finish low down the table but you could see what trying', 'ten haggi just have clue', '', 'the other issue that while would love massive clear out but when you have player long term contract who not_ want leave then there not_ much you can', 'personally the club doe need huge overhaul term getting rid bunch player combined with very good recruitment that said though also think eth probably need leave the club aswell because antony mount onana etc were his pick for the club and they have been mediocre best', 'glad mark and others have seen this fanbase for what they are yesterday fan the park were clapping the player off and asking for autograph and handshake have stop blaming the glazer the player and management even how the club run the biggest problem the fanbase going standard are the floor they would all turn the next home game mass again', 'ten hag that did not_ want have talk with rangnick use his finding klopp met with rodgers when took over and had talk that were useful', 'not_ fun fact last season united lost game all season after sunday game united will have defeat from game which stand for game lost', 'and were not_ even halfway through the season', 'mic drop', 'mctominay nowhere near good enough for but have certain respect for him hell play wherever asked give his all never complains know not_ liked some the far more talented player could with that mindset', 'getting crazy that when 2nil still wondering will concede rather than score another', 'the biggest concern with the club and this extends the manager recruitment spending close half billion new signing keeping the deadwood and basically ending with the same team ole unforgivable and would only happen man utd', 'this point lost not_ know who blame anymore the way have retrogressed over the year something would have never imagined year ago have never seen any big club with financial prowess and global appeal down this bad are mediocre every decision appointment signing made this club becomes sheer mediocrity', 'many people not_ seem understand mark point eth saying that just changing another manager right now will make him the scapegoat and will result keeping the player the leadership the recruitment and everyone else and will change nothing the next manager will the same exact position two year from now for united become team that competing for the top again there need cleanout first and then bring new manager better condition']",3414

tearsofthekingdom legendofzelda somethingseries parody nintendoswitch zelda nintendo animation terminalmontage",5968,"link does another speed run and ganondorf dancing his another suave dance

lol nice animation
loved seeing nabiu with a doortal at 533 cant wait for the pilot
510 all things considered ganon using his own health bar as a weapon is metal asf
rauru it would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi 

link wing shield jumps disrespectfully
the five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
i love the ending where it seems that link is going to save zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until link realizes that the speedrun is over
i dont know what zelda told rauru about linkbut he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
i appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and i appreciate that you gave it some meaning and the ganondorf fight was next level
i already knew he couldnt get wrecked like the other endbosses because of suavemente but i never would have expected that his weakness was no suavemente 
also i laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon
in all its accurate to the source material and continue what you do best
the fact that ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and i love it 
the life ending neck cracks throughout the terminal montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
when ganon started  dancing suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears love the details 
merry christmas  jeremy big hugs to you and the team i love your work 
all the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing ive been waiting for this one for a while
gotta love how link doesnt even bother trying to save zelda the first time then doesnt even visibly question or react beyond the mandated qte to the fact that shes suddenly appeared out of nowhere in freefall and still leaves her to take a dunk in the lake 
425 this is my favorite moment you can feel links determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
a rush of dopamine always hits hard every time i enjoy the chaos of another video 

also i love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol
421 i cant imagine how terrified that bokoblin mustve been he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing hyah sounds and then link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
your animations will never get old
325 as much as i find the gloom hands to be terrifying i would imagine it would be cool if ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack lookout landing it wouldnt add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like ganondorf was more of a threat
447 is seriously the coolest attack animation youve ever done
the amount of effort that goes into these is bonkers and im so grateful as i expect are the speedrunners",20,Gaming,4360000,PT7M18S,"['link doe another speed run and ganondorf dancing his another suave dance', '', 'lol nice animation', 'loved seeing nabiu with doortal 533 cannot wait for the pilot', '510 all thing considered ganon using his own health bar weapon metal asf', 'rauru would reckless for you head directly the castle this poi', '', 'link wing shield jump disrespectfully', 'the five loaf passage used for duplication glitch actually genius', 'love the ending where seems that link going save zelda the most emotional scene the whole game until link realizes that the speedrun over', 'not_ know what zelda told rauru about linkbut certainly not_ ready for that level chaotic', 'appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch even though patched really this easy use and appreciate that you gave some meaning and the ganondorf fight next level', 'already knew could not_ get wrecked like the other endbosses because suavemente but never would have expected that his weakness suavemente', 'also laughed hard once used his healthbar weapon', 'all accurate the source material and continue what you best', 'the fact that ganondorf using his dance actual form combat hilarious and love', 'the life ending neck crack throughout the terminal montage franchise are hilariously satisfying lmao', 'when ganon started dancing suavemente and talking about copyright had tear love the detail', 'merry christmas jeremy big hug you and the team love your work', 'all the enemy and character your style look amazing have been waiting for this one for while', 'got love how link doe not_ even bother trying save zelda the first time then doe not_ even visibly question react beyond the mandated qte the fact that she suddenly appeared out nowhere freefall and still leaf her take dunk the lake', '425 this favorite moment you can feel link determination run toward ganondorf and the music the background getting louder link approach ganondorf', 'rush dopamine always hit hard every time enjoy the chaos another video', '', 'also love how faithful your video are the glitch the game lol', '421 cannot imagine how terrified that bokoblin must have been probably just heard explosion and the scream his brother accompanied menacing hyah sound and then link just morphs out the wall like some kind eldritch creature', 'your animation will never get old', '325 much find the gloom hand terrifying would imagine would cool ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hand any other monster attack lookout landing would not_ add much the story but would make felt like ganondorf more threat', '447 seriously the coolest attack animation you have ever done', 'the amount effort that into these bonkers and grateful expect are the speedrunners']",438

props to keith and becky for keeping their baby very private shows theyre already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them
the mystery event is 100 a 24 hour livestream of eugene sitting on keiths lap
so much respect for keith and becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality ahem that is the way to raise a child as a public figure congrats to you both
i appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to eugene the fact that hes off making his dreams come true and they dont make him pick try guys over that is amazing hes still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy 
i cant believe the return of candid competition isnt the biggest announcement thats incredible news
i consider kwesi an official try guy he fits so well hes so perfect so funny and sweet
even though the situation that caused it was awful i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible the variance of content the variance of oncamera personalities its all such a breath of fresh air theres so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now there really is something for everyone
i miss eugene but were all proud of him and excited for everything hes a part of i struggle with change but yall make it exciting
i would love to see another episode about zach talking about his chronic pain management him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot
the best thing try guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in jared kwesi johnny marissa are the best additions to the try family
okay i gotta say you guys blow my mind i first arrived here because of the event but i stayed here because i liked your personality and because i was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or dumb they are in the past year ive been learning more and more about how you manage the company how you create more content etc and wow i respect it so much and this video just confirmed it even more for me
honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the keith and zach channel and eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and zach and keith have always been my favorite try guys
ive said it before and ill say it again this channel has the most talented editors every single video looks so incredible
i really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen so happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth
i am so damn proud of them to see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years i am so damn proud
we miss eugene when hes not here but im so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them i hope it all turn out great for him 3
the way they are so candid about why theyre charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on youtube is incredible honestly i love that about them
i love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship

hi claire since finding your channel ive dragged myself up my first 5 munros experiencing 45mph winds with rain and sleet low cloud with sideways hail or 9 celsius and a foot of snow with the best views i was scared to put myself to such a test and seeing you doing what you do gave me the push i needed you do scare me sometimes though the way you wingit stay safe stay warm stay dry and stay strong

facing the trepidation of the first step
loving the elation of reaching that summit
and reliving those moments as you look back at the route that was taken
hi claire fantastic jaunt into the wild if noones mentioned it those jelly like blobs are probably frog egg sacks they arent always found in water and those may have been laid when the water level was higher or there was a puddle right where they were
youre awesome claire keep being you and inspiring others to get out and explore
as someone whos encountered rampaging cows in the mountains too never underestimate an angry cow great video

now this is a good way to start the afternoon i missed these videos im glad youre back and hoping the ankle holds up edit im glad about the ankle youre right to be careful with it in the future because joints rarely if ever heal back to normal 38 years later i still get the odd reminder that i abused mine and youre so right about gratitude it wouldnt be much of a stretch to call it a key to happiness thanks for the video

clashofclans coc th16 townhall16 clashon hammerjam foryou foryoupage fyp gaming update heroequipment spiritfox rootrider",2683,"lets go love that players from th8 and above have access to the equipment it certainly will be one of the most epic ever great job
i seen very few games that i never get bored of truly a master piece thanks a lot supercell
adding hero equipment is such a good idea im glad the devs found a way to make attacking more interesting and interactive without having to make it too complex
just saw the patch notes they changed the power potion effect from laboratory level to townhall level this means you dont have to make lab your priority after upgrading to a newer townhall 
loved everything so far but maybe a alternative th defense would be better next time rather than the 4th remake of gigainferno
wish we could still have the stat progress bars so you could see how the new equipment progresses with each upgrade relative to the maxed stats
i really love the update specially the nature sheme it looks so awesome but i it wouldve be alot better if the townhall would do a massive earthquake when troops comes near it than this lame inferno weapon but yeah thats my opinion
to give a significant role to the walls now they could start doing damage to troops since they have fire pikes or eletricity
im glad the hero abilities stayed at the right level good job supercell greatest update ive been present for
edit i do wish the blacksmith was elixir to upgrade instead of gold
i love how its straight to the point
i like when they add both new content for max players and some stuff for us midtownhall players too
been saying hero skins need to come with varying abilities for years now glad they finally made a way to have heros adjustable
what i think is that we were getting a free upgrade on our hero abilities by upgrading our heroes but now we have to extra grind for them separately 
the new troop is absolutely devastating it really opens up the base
part of coc since a decade 
lots of love waiting for update as quick as possible 
one of the biggest updates ever never bored clashing way to go team 
the giant arrow is so fun

its hitbox might be a bit big though it hits stuff that it doesnt even come close to visually touching a 05 tile radius would be more fitting to the visual and might help temper its power a bit
loved it wow such a upgraded version we awaiting  amazing 
respect for game developers
i love the hero equipment as long as they dont make it pay to win its gonna be so much fun it also allows for more build crafting for players which is so fun and makes attacks unique",20,Gaming,20100000,PT3M14S,"['let love that player from th8 and above have access the equipment certainly will one the most epic ever great job', 'seen very few game that never get bored truly master piece thanks lot supercell', 'adding hero equipment such good idea glad the devs found way make attacking more interesting and interactive without having make too complex', 'just saw the patch note they changed the power potion effect from laboratory level townhall level this mean you not_ have make lab your priority after upgrading newer townhall', 'loved everything far but maybe alternative defense would better next time rather than the 4th remake gigainferno', 'wish could still have the stat progress bar you could see how the new equipment progress with each upgrade relative the maxed stats', 'really love the update specially the nature sheme look awesome but would have alot better the townhall would massive earthquake when troop come near than this lame inferno weapon but yeah that opinion', 'give significant role the wall now they could start doing damage troop since they have fire pike eletricity', 'glad the hero ability stayed the right level good job supercell greatest update have been present for', 'edit wish the blacksmith elixir upgrade instead gold', 'love how straight the point', 'like when they add both new content for max player and some stuff for midtownhall player too', 'been saying hero skin need come with varying ability for year now glad they finally made way have hero adjustable', 'what think that were getting free upgrade our hero ability upgrading our hero but now have extra grind for them separately', 'the new troop absolutely devastating really open the base', 'part coc since decade', 'lot love waiting for update quick possible', 'one the biggest update ever never bored clashing way team', 'the giant arrow fun', '', 'hitbox might bit big though hit stuff that doe not_ even come close visually touching tile radius would more fitting the visual and might help temper power bit', 'loved wow such upgraded version awaiting amazing', 'respect for game developer', 'love the hero equipment long they not_ make pay win going much fun also allows for more build crafting for player which fun and make attack unique']",194

its hard being pregnant giving birth and being a mom women need to be able to be open about that more instead of shamed for it because it really is not for everyone and thats okay
molly we support you and care about you always know your worth not financially but your inner worth thats most important of all 
i think youre both amazing   people tend  to forget how young both molly and tommy are to be first time parents while handling successful and busy careers all while being under the scrutiny of the media cannot be easy you both get judged at every step i hope you continue to carry this  attitude  molly 
i love how real she is
okay this is so random but you are the definition of someone who glows on both the inside and outside you are such a genuine and inspiring woman
it physically hurts my heart that you cant be more honest with us anymore  you must be under so much pressure moll and you do an amazing job under the circumstances i look upto you so much and i hope you keep your pure heart 
girly you best believe when i had my daughter i chucked so many things away in first year of mum life because i was like i will never do this again i was truly traumatised from the birth colic not good sleeper regressions my body and so on but shes nearly 3 now and im slowly starting to feel like i would love another theres so much pressure especially when they reach 2 years old to have another do whats best for you your mental health and your family i always thought id have a small age gap but im so glad im waiting until im ready xxx
the newborn stage is very hard no one can prepare you for it no matter how much support you have it is absolutely exhausting both physically and mentally  i cant even remember the first 6 months of my daughters life because i was so exhausted and i realised about 5 months in that i had terrible post natal depression honestly you are doing amazing molly  i was a single mum and i feel like with tommy being away at camp so much you must have been on your own a lot too but yes  you are amazing and i completely understand where youre coming from sending you lots of love and glad that you are all happy and healthy x
so glad you openly talk about hard being a mum is it literally is the hardest job in the world and i wish more people were open and honest about it cos i genuinely feel like this big expectation is painted for us and then when real life looks anything different it can feel so lonely my little boy will be 2 in march and still doesnt sleep through and its honestly hell not getting a proper nights sleep  but then i have so many positive things to say too swings in roundabouts being a mum thats for sure x
i went to school with conna and she was so glam at school its mad how she created her brand at such a young age and how successful she is  
this is my favourite video i have ever watched molly mae is so real and genuine and i look up to her so much her and zoes videos keep me going honestly dont know where i would be without those two
im glad you are both going to be ok  i cant even imagine the stress and scrutiny you are stronger than you think molly 
her pride is not in her appearance alone it in her strength kindness and beauty

it was 10 months for me when i finally felt at ease with having a baby it stopped feeling like such forced joy but real joy x
molly i love this video so much and your candidness and this type of content is so needed  so many women show the positives which is fine but there are negatives too although they often fail to get mentioned  the fight or flight comment is so real because those without kids dont understand you literally have someones life in the palm of your hands literally so you can be extremely anxious especially at the beginning but i think this talk was really a tribute to what a good and thoughtful mother you are because you are aware and honest about your struggles bambi is so lucky to have a mom like you 
her pride is not in her appearance alone it in her strength kindness and beauty 
343 lets only take a moment to appreciate how much hours and work she put in this vidits unbelievable and i think they deserve a lot more than that
i also hated the newborn stage but am thriving in the toddler stage youve got this 
yes were definitely waiting for 2nd one but best thing being a mum but hard work you dont know until you become a mum x proud of you girl
im a first time mum with a 4 month old and i honestly watched you throughout your pregnancy and having bambi and hearing you talk about your own experiences is so so what i needed to hear it is so hard at the start and you finding your feet i feel like im finding mine too navigating your new life with a baby your new body skin hair everything we need more people to be open about th3 struggles

pokemon legendarypokemon infinitefusion",532,"pokemon fusions are one thing but the fact things like deoxys and regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
the only thing i regret is not fusing more legendaries with magikarp
i actually like this twist to a fusions playthrough because we get to see the coolerrarer fusions
no chance john wins that champion battle without tyler he really saved the day
the miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now tysm john and tyler for putting this in
i love that john still names his requazas gregory after that epic jmc episode in season 1 
i also love how john plays this game we all know legends are the most fun to fuse xd
935 loving the ben 10 reference with this one been rewatching it this week for the first time since i was a kid and just finished my first ever infinite fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a chronosapienclockwork reference in this fangame i hope you do more videos on it
pm7 providing top notch quality videos right when im about to eat lunch lovely
i love all the screams tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
how can you follow up giratina square
lance another one
roger is one of my favourite fusions ive seen across all infinite fusion content love the videos john
that raikouhydreigon is so sick that could definitely be a boss battle in dark souls or something
ive always wanted to play infinite fusion but just have never found the time its nice to see someone exploring all the fun legendary fusions
i cant believe it he actually evolved feesh raydos might look awesome but itll never recapture the image of rayeesh
i seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 
lets go clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurkdialga fusion
2531 that just about killed me
its never too late to do a playthough of a game ive seen lots of infinite fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it really looking forward to the next part
also i think the catch rate might be higher in this game or fluctuate depending on the fusion but i was still left in suspense at all the captures
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level so you dont see slugmas and pichus in the elite 4

i got my eyes on the new mustang finally a proper modern mustang
just done the cayo perico start to finish exactly the same way taco does it and i only noticed one small change 
it the intel gather mission when you steal the plane to fly to the island the driver side door is no longer stuck open this is excellent for my ocd 
i regret choosing the most expensive location hard to get into shop gang attack could spawn and cars dont always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the moc to have the leds from the christmas truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 here is your weekly update video including all of the things added in the winter dlc chop shop what do you think of this new dlc so far more vids coming throughout the day
prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane
the range rover was on my very short list along with the escalade v and that 96 impala ss was an amazing surprise but im still hurt about no new   dubsta aka g5563 its got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community the turismo and the chop shop are the only things ill have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me
the new grotti drives so damn nice liking the new declasse impaler lx but i just love them type of muscle cars anyway the vigero zx and dominator are pretty cool but i still prefer the roof up best feature so far the garage organizer
the vehicle prices are crazy  i wish it was more like real life
tuner update and chop shop are my fav so far love the low grips and manual stick
so far so good this is a solid dlc its a w from me still would have liked to have a heist with this dlc as well but its all good
top tier i appreciate the time and effort put into the vids

the car selection for this update is quite nice loving the infiniti and the camry
another change that i noticed on ps is when you fire the avenger turrets it changes to a different turret they made it the same button
well i actually like the interaction menu updates there are less items in each category now makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier will this change speed runs
im probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle but im hyped that we can get the cluckin bell van and omg the baller std only rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
done my first complete salvage mission start to finish took almost 2 hours without knowing what the heck i was doing mind and made gta350000 from it 
not the worst business by a long shot and im sure well all get quicker at doing them

its clear to me laird gets her inspiration to become a landlord after dealing with such an incompetent property owner
its here 
nosy generous and cringe uh oh i think you accidentally made laird into my mother 
i really love when james gets so excited about how convenient and perfect it is to have a makers space in the world as if he didnt do it intentionally to help with handiness 
when u find a bike or any draggable item in the dumpster you have to put it first in your own lot then go to build buy and put it in the household inventory for the game to consider it as your own
the sims team should update the woodworking table for sure its so sad that we have to use mods to make it fun to play with
james constantly dabbing and wearing the cringe meme shirt is absolutely everything this lp is already one of my favourites also why is it kinda really easy to make money in this game by just scamming your landlord and spreading secrets i swear this is the strongest start for any of the bigwallets
for the white cake situation its the foodie nap get rid of it and disable npcs from voting for naps in the options this is why i dont play with any of the naps most of them just cause really annoying stuff like the white cake making to happen
the landlord visit for the stove was so funny  i have a feeling this will be a common problem for this lp
ah yes the 6 simoleons shes is basically rich compared to her ancestors 
i love how youre not the landlord but literally doing all the landlord things 
i laughed way to hard at james saying disable furry effect 
idk if its a glitch oe not but the landlord ignoring the burnt stove even after having it pointed out and paying laird less than a quarter of its cost was hilarious
i think you should clear up the counter space or add some more counters so they stop leaving food unmade

thankfully santas vision is based on movement so glad that everyone is safe
so impressive that aunty donna got the real santa claus to feature in their video
i love it when the news gets a bit naughty bit cheeky all in good fun all in good fun
this is exactly what its like to watch the news on christmas eve
i love sketch sketchy sketch sketch here it goes down down into my belly
i love how zach consistently mantains that gormless expression throughout 

anyway time to get on with watching this video
im just surprised santa had time to visit the studio in between delivering presents and cucking with elves
this is the kind of ground breaking news reporting that the world needs right now  bipartisan sticking to the facts and being professional at all times is so important
i love the concept of having a christmas themed skit all about some mundane christmas thing maybe next year you guys can expand this and do one on some type of favorite christmas dessert
cant belive santa who is poly didnt give zach a bike after offering it think zach has been a naughty boy this year
i cant believe mick molloy has been santa this whole time  
now i want a news skit where mark is not just the weatherman but every single onfield reporter
only aunty donna can get one of the biggest aussie comedians put them in an indistinguishable costume and make no mention of who they are
good to see broden has finally admitted defeat
i would have loved this sketch but as a professional kid i unfortunately had to go to bed so i didnt see it
broden should wear glasses more in sketches it gives him a totally different vibe

ramsdale was beaten  it was an incredible reaction save onto the post the ramsdale hate continues
elneny still being at arsenal is midboggling only the player still left from the wenger days
happy ramsdale got his debut finally and eddie scored his first champions league goal was also pretty impressed by nelson arteta has got to give him more of a chance in the league
015 what a tackle by saliba
im not sure how arsenals second goal was an offside i think that was kiwiors goal and he was on
that bakayoko looks a player ripped us tonight
225 the save and reaction time by ramsdale is crazy
player who headed arsenals 2nd wasnt offside  whats going on here
reiss nelson motm deserves more gametime
229 do they not realise ramsdale tipped it onto the post 
reiss nelson should be trusted more by arteta great finish from eddie lord please help smith rowe to stay injury free amen
bakayoko what a talent 
glad ramsdale finally made a well deserved champions league appearance he is one of the reasons we are in the competition and his treatment over raya has been awful by arteta i wish eddie scored in games when it matters as he has been pretty absent for some time now needs to prove why we dont need to seek a striker in the transfer window
233 not offside absolutely shocking decision but thats nothing new against arsenal despite the game being meaningless
i think the selection and the subs used in this game were needless from arteta ive no idea why hes against playing the youngsters in a game like this i genuinely believe that if saka was in the u21s when arteta joined us hed be nowhere near as established as he is now
i watched the match and ramsdale and elneny performed rlly well hope they get some more mins
playing saliba and gabriel come on bruv give them a rest knowing were topping the group regardless of todays result and the fact that weve got a couple of big games coming up too

lyrics
hi 
are you looking for the other side 
feel like nothing ever seems quite right 
are you circling the drain pipe 
getting off on pain like 
youre corrupted 
i need to know where your loyalties lie 
tell me are you gonna bark or bite 
do you really want to twist the knife 
in the belly of the monster 
get the fuck up 
wake the fuck up 
wipe the system 
and back the fuck up 
youre a puppet 
when they cut your strings off 
dont come crawling back 

kingslayer 
destroying castles in the sky
kingslayer 
forevermore the apple of my eye 
id sacrifice my life to find you 
angel of the blade 
kingslayer 
come and collect us from the night 

 cry 
  
  
   

another world  
this world is so dark that i cant see 
the future wont disappear 
but i want to obtain 
another world

system failure 
life 
is encrypted 
you are modified 
like a virus
in a lullaby 
artificial til the day you die 
silly programme 
youre corrupted 
get the fuck up 
wake the fuck up 
wipe the system 
 back the fuck up 
youre a puppet 
when they cut your strings off 
dont come crawling back 
youre on your own 
 
  
 
 

now lets go 
and open the door of time 

kingslayer 
destroying castles in the sky
kingslayer 
ill fight for you until i die 
kingslayer 
destroying castles in the sky 
kingslayer 
forevermore the apple of my eye 
id sacrifice it all to guide you 
never have to battle alone 
kingslayer 
come and collect us from the night 
this is your wake up call 
were going down the rabbit hole 
are you ready 
i cant feel you 
is this what you want 
this is what youll fucking get

ufc",2367,"the fact that wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
always rooting for wonderboy hes a great role model love seeing him teach the kids karate
if the ufc made a show about wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome id never miss an episode
thompson is unreal he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
this was one of the most positive and happy embedded ive seen happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week theyll need it for the presser
such a heartwarming embedded even someone im not a fan of like paddy hes a good dude at heart good to see
im proud of wonderboys facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight but ensuring that they get their homework done
wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act its honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
123 i respect wonderboy so much he knows to his core all his skills took time years  years of honing what hes teaching these children  by simply picking them up from school a world class fighter you have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds we all got in this art from watching movies i cant imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training
since everyone is talking about how great wonderboy is 

right after the luque fight i ran into him at disneyland i was a single rider on the smugglers run ride and ended up with him and his family i was so stoked i told him my wife cant ride because she is with my 2 year old son and he said well youre part of our family for this ride now

after the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son he was seriously the nicest guy id ever met it was something ill never forget
wonderboy really is that dude great human being
why cant wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years hes one of the nicest guys on the planet and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
the fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing ive ever seen
we need more fighters like wonderboy in gyms everywhere a good man is hard to find
brandon royval and stephen thompson seem like genuinely good guysrole models really nice to see that
paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell hes a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan 
im rooting for royval and edwards 
but it aint going to be easy 
what a great card to end the year

good bye large cameraman your heroic act will never be forgotten 
this series never disappoints cool
looks like the cameraman found the skibidi lab bases sound like this is gonna be an interesting episode
mad respect for the large cameraman he risked his life for recording 67 from 14 now  he is in peace you will be remembered man
press f to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman
rest in peace large cameraman 
you were loved and you helped the cameraman find the factory and protected everyone 
you will be missed
gran cmaraman tiene mis respetos muri como un gran guerrero que hasta el final protegi a sus compaeros si dudar 
rest in peacelarge cameraman youve been a brave soldieryou will never be forgotten
presione f para presentar sus respetos al camargrafo grande l era el punto de vista del episodio 67 merece respeto por sacrificarse
agora sim o dafuqboom se surpreendeu no roteiro deixou os tits de lado e mostrou o que os personagens secundrios so capazes os personagens vo morrendo aos poucos na fbrica dos skibidis isso  insano e tenso epica luta a desse episdio
this almost made me cry rip large cameraman  rpg he will always be remembered and be in our hearts we only got to see him in the previous episode same as 66 also with his last lives he still did a thumbs up still in pain
respect to that large cameraman rest in peace
dafuq as i didnt see almost anyone talking im going to say you probably wont see this video but it doesnt matter im sending my strength to you man every time i go into the comments i see people talking about how the video is or so saying that you are no longer the same im not saying that this second is all of them but anyway i came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us and for what you have to go through with rude comments i dont know how you are behind that screen but i hope you are well they will probably tell me if anyone sees this you deserve a rest man take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity go out with your friends and go to a place to rest your mind well i just said that because im really worried about your psychology all the work you do when it comes to being private motherfucker saying skibidi skibidi all the time and in return getting insults that youre not the same anymore thats it probably no one will read this but its here now im less worried
what i love about episode 68 is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also rip large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
dude the large characters are the underappreciated heroes seeing as the large speakerman died then the large cameraman that might mean that large tv man is next on the chopping block rip large cameraman
wow inspiring to say the least a year ago today i was standing on a 351849 mile long sandwich  which too be fair had no mustard and was about to eat it all  this video along with the tuna song saved me

drumeo nandibushell twistedsister",1839,"thank you so much drumeo for inviting me on i had the best time
aj pero was a criminally underrated drummer  lots of people are unaware at how good he really was
a great fresh version of a classic

her innocence when she says  i like how they all dressed up for the video
keep rocking nandi great work 
if you want to try this and many other drumless songs get a 7day free trial to check out drumeo  httpwwwdrumeocomtrial
shes 1000x better at this age then ill ever be in my life  so much talent and work
absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer its truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age i can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums the precision timing and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable a true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself
she effin killed it  her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing  i was super impressed  im not as surprised now to see how foo fighters identified her skill so long ago  this was incredible  no offense to twisted sister but i think she really turned it up to 11
that was phenomenal you can see how nandis taken all of the lessons from chad smith and dave grohl to heart so happy to hear her keeping rock alive id say her drums worked better in places than the original track she had more fills and had some double kick in places one of the best in this series
this was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 
her talent just shines in this video  what a great take on that song
her approach brings such a late 90searly 00s poppunk vibe to the whole song if that version were released in that era it still would have been a hit
what i love about nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is you can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that
i love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hihat that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when its metal
she is so impressive with not only how she plays which is outstanding but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly
aj is smiling down at this best series hands down shes so effin talented 
nandi is so awesome what an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid this was pure joy
i gotta saythis was amazing nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before wow wow wow 
im so psyched to see nandi on here  love her drumming love her energy this is an amazing performance  so many little things match up with her version and the original  cant wait to see more of nandi here  i know the guys of twisted sister will love this
nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with dave grohl im very impressed shes got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that dont overwhelm the overall song great work from her and i think once her gcses and a levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one

jimmy could never do this
iykyk
that transformation from ethan and simon shaking from pain to harry and josh casually eating breakfast was top tier
ethan  simon trying their best
tobi  jj suffering
harry  josh happy wholesome couple having fun
tobi and jj getting driven around just to go back to man vs food is so funny 
props to ethan and simon for suffering through those unholy wings sacrifices that did not go unnoticed
the cut between ethan and simon suffering and josh and harry enjoying themselves was quality 
go hard or go home 
shoutout too all the sidemen for giving a legit effort for the challenges and content yall killed this
the cut from simon and ethan tweaking to josh and harry enjoying life is everything 
the jj  tobi pairing is underrated tobi definetly brings our a calmer side to jj and jj brings out a more joker side to tobi
this was an awesome video its one thing to watch beardmeatsfood absolutely crush these challenges but its even better watching two normal guys try to tag team one it makes what beardmeatsfood does way crazier but theres something more interesting about watching normal people struggle their way through it
i love how harry exposes the concept of this video about an hour in
i would have liked to see this be 3 challenges over 3 days im not sure how else they thought this would go down
also food waste was inevitable glad harry gave the pizza out
tobi and jj had me laughing so hard the entire video  this is quality content
ethan saying hes a professional eater while having something stuck to the front of his tooth killed me i cant stop laughing i just wanna tell him
2708 its so funny everyone suffering and harry and josh just having the most wholesome time ever like two fine english men chatting
josh and harry is like watching a father with his son

get closer to the likes of jack grealish bunny shaw kevin de bruyne lauren hemp erling haaland ellie roebuck phil foden esme morgan and the rest of pep guardiola  gareth taylors teams",805,"as a chess and football fan i see this as an absolute win
magnus explained football and chess perfectly even pep was shocked there
thanks for giving me the opportunity to host  be in the same room as these two geniuses  
goats
pep was clearly impressed when magnus was speaking the eyes say it all
you can tell pep enjoyed this he looked so deep in thought when magnus was speaking
this is such an insane crossover as both a man city fan and a lover of chess 

all the best at the currently ongoing cct to magnus vamos 
its rare that someone impresses pep you clearly see magnus caught peps attention within the first 10 sec when pep crossed his arms and touched his face
incredible hearing magnus speak about the similarities between chess and football
for those who dont know much about chess let me tell you that magnus is the strongest chess player who has ever lived he gave up his world championship because he believed there was no adversary that could beat him in a wc match and no one argued against it
hes not only the greatest chess player of all time but also was briefly ranked world no 1 in 2019 in premiere league fantasy football
a football genius a chess world champion and pep guardiola all in the same room

mega stuff fg x
without riyad in that movement everything would not be possible he still thanks and praises him what a coach
i love the way magnus is trying to simplify chess concepts for pep magnus knows more football compared to how pep knows chess as a chess and football fan lots for respect for both i just love this 12 minute video wish it could have been an hour
look how happy is magnus to be there and talk about this 
i think he feels on the same wave and mindset as pep great chemistry and duo 
bravo to the host for asking great questions and allowing these two geniuses to share their wisdom uninterrupted

its common to see hosts who do too much and end up imposing themselves onto a video like this really nice to see one who gets it
the best interview i have seen in both sports what an insane explanation magnus gave to the resemblance of football and chess the look on peps face says it all lastly the interviewer was just amazing great questions solid handling of two pure geniuses very very enjoyable to watch and what a nice unexpected collision of two legends
we want more of pep and magnus collab or a much longer interview
lets make these two brainstorm something 
its was so unexpected but quite a pleasant surprise nonetheless to see these 2 guys i admire so much together

im an american and i must say the wales family are a breath of fresh air
i really love how george and charlotte and louis work together to help their mother pack and carry things its very rare for me to see something like this and the first time i saw this video i feel extraordinary closeness and warmth in the welsh family  thanks for sharing this video
if all parents took their time to educate their children like this we would have a better world
this is really a great initiative we would like also to inform everyone that we collected thousands of 9o off codes for this month make sure to get some
this is so wonderful catherine teaching her children at a young age to give back i love that they took boxes out of their car to give as well
catherine is a great teacher to her childrensimple as that  just having them aware of other human beings like themselves
this is such a wonderful caring video  princess catherine bringing her children to volunteer helping with the huge job of sorting of dividing the donations for families in need  not only have they learned the positive lesson of volunteering but more importantly they are learning about the thousands of children and families who are struggling and will be so happy to receive this loving outpouring of support from their communities during the holidays the wales children are caring and loving just like their wonderful parents  
got very emotional watching how down to earth the wales family are catherine princess of wales emits beauty from within
the interactions between herself the children and the people surrounding her 
is genuine and regal 
the children are so naturally well behaved may god bless them the wales family is built on solid foundations and stability
how can you not love this family kudos to the prince and princess of wales for raising well adjusted children they are doing an amazing job
love how  george wants to come back yes momma train them to serve and care about others
the fact that the children behave so well and so politely is all due to their parents
great mother great wife and great future queen of the uk princess catherine works hard to carve out her own roles and create her own style of doing things it is never look at me aint i a great humanitarian we can see her humility dedication steadfastness of purpose and tremendous hard work thank you catherine we are lucky to have you and your family
what a wonderful mother teaching her children the value of giving back to others and recognizing those in need there is not a greater gift than compassion for others and while i am sure catherine and william teach many private lessons on selflessness at home it is good to see george charlotte and louis in action no doubt these children will live lives of service and respect for all
the wales children are absolutely wonderful  so are their parents
catherine is an amazing mum educating her children to show respect and compassion for others who have far less than they do  the royal children do it so carefully and considerately they are an inspiration 
so wholesome a great example for everyone
it is so good to see catherine the princess of wales taking her children and teaching them to serve i got my kids to plan and prepare a meal to give to one a family having a new baby when they learn to serve when they are young the children grow to be empathic and compassionate and to look around outside themselves it is so good to see such an excellent example of guiding her children and being a leader for the world

what a simple message  to get out there and help in any way  it is good to see the future royals learning how to help  in the us we have a few organizations one is toy for tots  police depts  fire depts all get involved as do individuals to help out    there are many other organizations too  for single parents for runaway teens for the animals and those in hospitals  so many ways to get involved

that 00 to bournemouth had me dying inside  almost spit my water out in the gym
broskis this show was gold honestly proud how far this platform has came plenty of clips from that debate between turkish and hughie and grizz constant quality  love from oxford 
nah this is easily the best episode so far this season the cooking sessions were all on point top work guys always elevating 
it has to take the arsenal getting involved for the title race to be truly entertaining this is one of the best big six shows of all time and its because were going neck and neck with city  lpool mah tobs and saeed stirring everything nicely in the background as well 
5315 that saeed exit was quicker than henry at his peak
matisse got absolutely fried the september 17th tweet literally had me on the floor great show 

15435 underrated saeed quote im my opinion that was missed 
when we say this is the best show on youtube no cap is involved big up the whole team that mah cooking was insane 
this channel deserves so many more subs great content as ever keep it up lads 
the show was a masterclass show absolutely smashed it all you guys are legends man the panel compliments each other perfectly the matisse cooking was mad
the matisse segment killed me  i was walking to work and couldnt stop smiling i had to pause the video just so i wouldnt burst out laughing
this was the most fun ive had watching any big six episode  top class lads
this was one of best shows michelin star cooking of matisse great instigating by saeed and mah to get turkish and hugh at each others neck hugh is clearly settled in now and seems like he has moved to south london grizz and tobs taking great pleasure in being rude to each other

too show
tobis cooking of matisse was literal gold  those tweets have come back to haunt him expeditiously 
great episode fantastic intro video by skull had me creasing  and the matisse cooking  especially the 00 to bournemouth had me loling

givesyouwings f1",959,"vettel next please dont make us beg for it it just simply has to happen
happy for dc he put a lot of effort into building up this team glad he got to drive their best car to this date
for all the work dc has done for rb to lay the foundation for what it is today he absolutely deserves to experience such masterpiece of machinery now i wanna see newey webber and vettel in the rb19 as well
dc is one of the smartest funniest and most knowledgeable lads around and its an absolute joy to watch every time he does coverage for f1 its so amazing to see him tear up the track like an absolute pro
red bull is kind of company which takes a good care of its drivers sebastian buemi and dc are still under rbs payroll mark webber had rb money in his pocket years after he retired from f1 the company still supports marc marquez in motogp despite hes been riding for rival teams since rbktm partnership and alex albon during 2022 season in williams had it as personal sponsor he separated from rb just because the nature of mercedeswilliams cooperation
kudos to red bull i wish we had more sponsors like it
lovely seeing that scottish flag on the rb19s monocoque dc is the reason why i ever watched f1 in the first place  why i follow this team 
thank you red bull and christian for letting dc take a lap in a truly beautiful powerful dominant and aweinspiring machine
its a shame he only got one lap i would have liked to see him get fully comfortable over the course of a day
52 years old in an current gen era car is fantastic you can see the old school early 2000s trackline approach 
quite a reward from horner to a person who was dare to left mclaren mercedes and switched to a new team run by drink company and develop the car from not competitive into very dominating
 
also how people remember dc nowadays  schumacher angry pitlane meme
i have a huge amount of respect for dc he helped this team go forward and i think the team know this
dc is hands down the most likeable person in f1 you just cannot hate this man an absolute legend
the whitty humor of dc love it  and the comeradery within the team is so wonderful to see how liam fits right in gp there this was filmed on drs tyre testing day at silverstone i think few days after silverstone gp thats why horner was there too i just love the humor and the fun rbr has while working hard with full focus
the guy that helped get newey to rb gets to drive some of newey s best work beautiful to see
david is such a great guy he deserved this opportunity
the cars are very easy to drive
 liam lawson the man who replaced ricciardo after he crashed who replaced a de vries that couldnt stop crashing
thanks dc and red bull for an ear to ear smile throughout
liam comes across as a thoroughly decent guy
not my team but they seem to promote a family feel
very enjoyable
ive had the pleasure to work with dc on several occassions for these kinds of red bull productions and he really is just as likeable genuin humble and professional in person as he comes across in the content 
he gives everyone the same amount of respect and time such a gentleman
dc was my favorite driver when i was a kid i just loved something about him and now he is my favorite f1 promoter he still looks to be in great shape talks passionately and throws jokes all the time such a joy to watch him so nice of rb to let him drive the current car for a change he definitely deserved it

thedaybefore scam fntastic",1922,"the drama around this game was millions of times more entertaining than the game itself im almost sad its over seriously this is more like a crypto rug pull than a studio closure
this was a total social experiment and in some ways quite hilarious to prove a point that people will buy trash and be happy
the fact that hundreds of thousands of players actually bought such an obvious scam is the saddest part expect a lot more similar scams coming soon
most brain dead defenders of this game are like its not a scam you got a product  yes when i buy chevy camero and they give me a ford festiva im like well they did give me a product
these trash and overhyped companies need to face multimillion dollar lawsuits for false advertising
i get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games 
it honestly feels like everywhere i look there is a scam
this game was an ai generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
four days wow
that has to be some kind of record they didnt even try to hide it thats how confident they were that they could get away with it and they pretty much have
four days unbelievable
this is so blatantly a scam that im actually curious if this would qualify as criminal
like we all know that at least in america false advertising will never actually be prosecuted but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme also who wants to bet that those server issues at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund
as i said in other threads they met their contractual agreement to release a game they send their volunteers a boilerplate thank you email pay their investors and whatever is left theyll pocket without legal ramifications cant get money from a stone so by closing up shop theyre effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investorscreditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have 

they used the hype of tdb to generate a trickle of income through prop night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates

at this point steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue 

they pretty much have to at this point
its been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip  folks are claiming it was built using the 300 american city packs bundle which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95 of the ingame world would suggest is accurate its also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the 65 survival game kit v2 which is where the ingame inventory mechanics all come from
modern game made for modern gamers you all deserve each other

this was so obvious from day 1 too bad people still gave them money
watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly i cant fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming which is that i almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the actual product is instead of the dressedup version seen in trailers and marketing
personally i think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry these kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing
it would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release
imagine if you were one of those volunteers thinking they had a hand in something great and find out later the boss was scamming
this has been my favorite game for the last two years not because i was excited for it but because its just been a rollercoaster of bad pr and terrible decisions that led to what everyone knew from the beginning that this was a scam

twitter httpstwittercomthatmumbojumbo",1772,"as another comment pointed out you now need to have scar and grian try to watch this and build their own giant walking machines
mumbo you should make a machine that retracts fence posts
just in case youre being chased down by a warden 
i like mumbos concept of a basic loop and a jumbled loop however instead of jumbled loop i think it should be called a jumbo loop
if it is soo simple get grian and scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
it is kinda funny to see how closely mumbos three design rules parallel the design principles im learning as an engineering undergrad
ive never really gotten that into redstone so im genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along flying machines always mystified me but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes so much sense kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it
i love when we get mumbo videos like these  feels like the balance between theory and tutorial that makes it really easy for me personally to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards it doesnt ruin the magic of how you make them far from it it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand how cool your stuff is
yknow for tight timing things like this i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod  or recording in the 120 snapshots
that way youd have access to tick freeze and tick step which would make these explanations even better imo
this was actually really informative ive built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots thank you mumbo 
ps cool armadillo i love the eyebrows
you should use the new 1203 tick rate  tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video would probably help alot
what you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together when you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique a person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning and cool looking final product
the fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
reminds me of clockwork certainly gears are simple at their core but when combining them in large geartrains the complexity increases a lot of it is down to timing speed and torque 

fascinating
from now on every time mumbo states that something is simple we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement
ive only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle and ive already learned so much about these flying machines thank you so much mumbo
great video as always not sure if youve had a look at all the new snapshot features yet besides the crafting bench but the variable tick speed is really useful for showingseeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly
the carpet mod or even in vanilla since 1203 adds the tick command
this is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game and then go one tick at a time and see exactly whats happening and when
incredibly informative grian and scar can now fix docs giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 
i think this makes the whole process so much cooler even if in total its fairly simple
really cool to see the inner workings of how these seemingly complicated machines actually work",20,Gaming,9260000,PT17M52S,"['another comment pointed out you now need have scar and grian try watch this and build their own giant walking machine', 'mumbo you should make machine that retracts fence post', 'just case you are being chased down warden', 'like mumbos concept basic loop and jumbled loop however instead jumbled loop think should called jumbo loop', 'soo simple get grian and scar watch this video and watch them making flying machine', 'kind funny see how closely mumbos three design rule parallel the design principle learning engineering undergrad', 'have never really gotten that into redstone genuinely amazed that you explained such way that easy follow along flying machine always mystified but them being loop push and pull make much sense kind like caterpillar when you think about', 'love when get mumbo video like these feel like the balance between theory and tutorial that make really easy for personally synthesize understanding how the circuitry work while still having grand reference work towards doe not_ ruin the magic how you make them far from brings that magic within range knowledge that can actually understand how cool your stuff', 'yknow for tight timing thing like this would actually recommend getting either carpet mod recording the 120 snapshot', 'that way you would have access tick freeze and tick step which would make these explanation even better going', 'this actually really informative have built flying machine before and understood the basic idea but seeing broken down and explained like this really helped connect all the dot thank you mumbo', 'cool armadillo love the eyebrow', 'you should use the new 1203 tick rate tick step command decrease the tick and show slowmotion the flying machine the video would probably help alot', 'what you said the end about flying machine being smaller principle all put together applies many thing that you learn programming for example just bunch different component put together when you look from the top view you see all the smaller component but where becomes tricky putting them together make something cool and unique person could make those smaller component them self but would take lot more work and creativity make functioning and cool looking final product', 'the fact you can take something this crazy and simplify down succinct video honestly impressive more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build', 'reminds clockwork certainly gear are simple their core but when combining them large geartrain the complexity increase lot down timing speed and torque', '', 'fascinating', 'from now every time mumbo state that something simple need grian attempt and replicate verify that statement', 'have only watched far the fourth green rectangle and have already learned much about these flying machine thank you much mumbo', 'great video always not_ sure you have had look all the new snapshot feature yet besides the crafting bench but the variable tick speed really useful for showingseeing block movement sequence and other tricky redstone stuff which can hard figure out when happens quickly', 'the carpet mod even vanilla since 1203 add the tick command', 'this extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game and then one tick time and see exactly what happening and when', 'incredibly informative grian and scar can now fix doc giant tunnelbore just time for the end the season', 'think this make the whole process much cooler even total fairly simple', 'really cool see the inner working how these seemingly complicated machine actually work']",1072

music by kevin macleod httpsincompetechcom",2540,"missy is just literally the chillest creature out of everyone in this game shes so kumbaya and i need that i wish i had her energy
given how poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this i do hope she wont become this final hidden main antagonist
the fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is lowkey respectable great job man
i actually theorize that we wont meet catnap as this giant monster right away but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat however once he learns that poppy apposes the prototype it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form keep in mind that catnap can adjust the proportions of his body hes a sizeshifter
this game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
the character that is being tortured and strapped is dogday the leader of the smiling critters dogday is also the one of the screenshot coming out of a large tube we see him chasing the player on the trailer as well coming out of that same tube i believe that the guy on the phone saying this is what he does to heretics etc is dr harley the doctor sawyer from project playtime i am not sure but his voice is surely the same voice actor the dr was also the one responsible for the monsters the project being called the bigger bodies innitiative
the little critters were so cute in a creepy way seeing them with long human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel for me that made them look scarier than the plushie version i also noticed the stitches on the arms if they are working with the prototype maybe it helped make them biggertaller and safer we know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys
ill be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 
the scratch on the wall fully says fate awaits those who believe also that character we see tied up actually looks like the dog it has the same ears and if you look closely that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth this character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us
i think 1901 says peace awaits those who believe im really excited for the game though thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us mike
chapter 3 is lookin very good so far also massive props to mob entertainment just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story just cant wait to see it now xd
man i cant even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see catnap and something tells me that this is going to be the scariest chapter ever
my theory on nightmare huggy is that its the same one from chapter one but under the influence of catnap who saw how obedient huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again  through catnaps orders
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went wild  or rabid  the fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting cant wait to see  whos the real bad guy or something
given how much information is in this next chapter i wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe theyll do one more and then end the game it seems like were going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so i would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype also i just thought of this but its possible the player is a toy themselves if they were a bigger bodies toy they would be working in the factory have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged
one of the biggest things i cannot wait for is seeing how the player and poppy interact with kissy but why do i have this strange feeling like red flags are being raised that shell sacrifice herself to save poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter

idk id be happy if kissy lived but i guess we will have to wait and see
yo the voice lines from poppy it sounds so chilling shes actively trying to save people and kissy missy yes i knew she would be involved that would actually be so cool i really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people not just you were secretly the bad guy

GB,FIzurQuAJF0,the day before disaster sets a dangerous precedent,levelcapgaming,2023-12-11T21:35:32Z,"the day before,scam,scam game,asset flip,fntastic",737489,20218,"the day before launched 4 days ago and proved to be a monumental failure  so much so that the studio shutdown and is likely running with the money

special thanks to bigfrytv for his gameplay
hollyrexs clip httpswwwtwitchtvhollyrexclipbombastichyperalmonditsboshytimeyk9mhvw17bk6cm",2684,"steam has taken the game down  you can no longer buy it  apparently steam also holds money for 30 days  theyre also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played  so it looks like the developers jumped ship too early
luckily steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark this was too much of a scam even for steam
players and valve should put these guys in court
one thing i have learned over the years is there are people defending it means absolutely nothing in the world of video games    they love abuse
what people have to learn
never believe trailers 
never preoder anything
wait till the game is fully released
this is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on or rather orchastrated this game so people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
not to mention fntastic used volunteers in their development process they asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received participation certificates and free codes for the game every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it
the fact that the studio literally said shit happens is wow
level i gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isnt that easy
seconds later
also level random guy on reddit is recreating the game by himself  
i remember watching you when i was in middle school and you made airsoft videos im happy to see youre still at it man keep up the hard work 
imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be
keep an eye on the ranchers it was announced at tga a year ago and is going down the same route  even after a successful kickstarter
i have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens regardless of whether or not fntastic is actually in the red or not other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity expect to see people learning from the errors made by fntastic and performing scams better keep an eye out everyone do not buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear be cautious and stay safe and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
the frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam this was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release yet they bought it anyway its pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time
my biggest issue is i was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self but every video and trailer i watched i kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it but the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
i always follow the rule of if it looks and sounds too good to be true it probably is especially when they never show real in game footage
the gaming community should keep an eye on these people apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to eight points i feel theyll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
been appreciating your efforts since bf3  thank you for what you do
imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody i bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year thats making the game actually playable and improving on things too
i think this is a good thing long term for consumers if this doesnt get people to wise up and quit shelling out money for games without a good idea of what theyre getting something with a lot of thirdparty gameplay videos then theres no hope for video gamers",20,Gaming,1940000,PT10M53S,"['steam taken the game down you can longer buy apparently steam also hold money for day they are also allowing refund matter how long you have played look like the developer jumped ship too early', 'luckily steam accepting refund for player past the hour mark this too much scam even for steam', 'player and valve should put these guy court', 'one thing have learned over the year there are people defending mean absolutely nothing the world video game they love abuse', 'what people have learn', 'never believe trailer', 'never preoder anything', 'wait till the game fully released', 'this one those case where need make publicly visible who the scammer are that worked rather orchastrated this game people will know these scumbags decide just make new development team and try the same shit again', 'not_ mention fntastic used volunteer their development process they asked people help develop their game and exchange the volunteer received participation certificate and free code for the game every single stage development had the stench shady grifter all over', 'the fact that the studio literally said shit happens wow', 'level got give some credit the devs because what they put together not_ that easy', 'second later', 'also level random guy reddit recreating the game himself', 'remember watching you when middle school and you made airsoft video happy see you are still man keep the hard work', 'imagine they released the source code for the community use the foundation make the game supposed', 'keep eye the rancher announced tga year ago and going down the same route even after successful kickstarter', 'have feeling this will not_ the last time this happens regardless whether not_ fntastic actually the red not_ other people will see this possiblt opportunity expect see people learning from the error made fntastic and performing scam better keep eye out everyone not_ buy any new game from new and unknown developer until you see content creator review and give the all clear cautious and stay safe and hopefully this trend will die before take flight', 'the frustrating thing about this that consumer were told uncertain term practically all the gaming medium that this scam this made clear for them for pretty much year before release yet they bought anyway pretty hard imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that out there over that length time', 'biggest issue keeping eye this and planned get for self but every video and trailer watched kept sitting there feeling like this cash grab and not_ touch but the cinematic trailer they did looked great', 'always follow the rule look and sound too good true probably especially when they never show real game footage', 'the gaming community should keep eye these people apparently they have secondary studio already changed their name eight point feel they will continue their scam practice until they are demanded something the legal pathway thing', 'been appreciating your effort since bf3 thank you for what you', 'imagine legitimate developer like that guy joined make that parody bet they could have functional game out about month year that making the game actually playable and improving thing too', 'think this good thing long term for consumer this doe not_ get people wise and quit shelling out money for game without good idea what they are getting something with lot thirdparty gameplay video then there hope for video gamers']",653

and do check out auto reserve for your jaguar spares httpswwwautoreservejaguarcom",453,"the reason jag would have quoted 2600 for the subframe will be mainly labour in this situation you really need to take the subframe out of the car remove all rust down to bare metal and then paintwaxoyl it while its out of the car what youve done is basically put a rust proof layer on top of rust this will stop new moisture getting into the subframes metal but it wont stop the rust you left from spreading underneath the coating so it will look all nice and new but the metal will continue to deteriorate
jack next time you polish headlights i recommend putting masking tape on the paint around the lights first as its easy to accidentally polish through the paint on the edges of the panels  it lets you see if youre going past the edge of the light too often and gives the paint a touch of protection before it starts to burn off
the headlights will need a coat of uv resistant lacquer to last else youll need to polish them again in 1218 months as they will go cloudy again no biggie but worth getting them coated in my personal opinion
personally id have put a neutraliser on the rusty subframe to prevent corrosion coming back under the waxoil  i also always put copper ease on wheel bolts and the hub facing surfaces does make life easier thereafter  looks like its turning into a really usable and still gorgeous car
its great to see you back on the spanners jack as much as i love your reviews this content is what its all about 
i wouldve personally put some rust converter on the subframe as all youve done with the wax oil is lock in the rust which will make it worse long term i see it all the time you need to get rid of the rust first
if you have to attack the lights again please use tape around the surrounding bodywork
great result and just shows how much you can save on dealer quotes however i think the subframe refurb is a bit misleading as youve only really so it would seem got the crap off and sealed the bits you can physically get to you would really need to drop it and take off all the ancillary bits to do it properly just sayin
if you dont already i suggest only using single hex sockets on those kind of wheel nuts double hex ones can damage the this shells and they turn or get stuck in the socket 
found this out the hard way
similarly id avoid using an impact wrench to undo or tighten them as it will break them with no warning use a socket and bar to undo and a torque wrench to tighten
the subframesuspension fix is very temporary
not bad to do and it will buy you some time definitely but i would have removed the thing and either wirewheeled it or better sandblasted it then painted it properly and coating it after that
as a proud canadian owner of an 07 xkr i appreciate your content jack  looking forward to more  thank you
4050 years ago it was common for cars to allow water ingress my old sd1 was always filling up but i find it hard to believe that in this day and age most manufacturers still havent eliminated the problem great video though jack very entertaining  and im so pleased that you saved yourself a small fortune
great channel jack  painting over rust is never a good idea though moisture will get underneath the paint and be trapped which accelerates decay just the lanoguard would be a better idea if you want a quick fix 
the quality of your videos never disappoint jack ive lost count the years ive been watching now
this is what you do best jack i do like the reviews but this is your real strength very entertaining and informative content
great job jack  im not sure if its true with the 42 cars but with the 50 cars you need to have the new battery programed to the car so that it will charge correctly  battery issues can cause endless headaches with these beauties so just make sure that new battery will last  cheers
well done jack i love seeing the economy minded approach to repairs
hello jack great to see you getting your hands dirty again for the subframe or just rusty parts in general a rust converter is a great step before wax oil treatment in theory encasing the part in wax oil should inhibit the rusting process but ifwhen the wax oil chips away youre back to square one a uv clear coat on the headlights will keep them looking clear for longer
i really enjoy this sort of video  its what got me hooked back in the ferrari repair days  the craziest estimate you quoted from jag has the be the headlamp work  so easy and cheap to just routinely buff out the headlamp housing  keep it coming

i bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign and its absolutely amazing i used it for a few hours on the 4th of july and had no issues i didnt even have to refill it
oh my sweet celestia i love the logo design with aperture science

and id say its accurate because you guys are the embodiment of science is about why not

also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
fun personal experience for about a year i worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with class 10 clean rooms no perfume cologne makeup or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there and no skin exposed everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed and goggles that even had small air filters in them

james ive gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode this episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that ive been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today i sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team def bought a minisabre too
not a starwars fan more of a pirates of the caribbean guy but i loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic its an amazing project with an amazing team
i know no one will see this but i just want to say how amazing you guys are from your garage to the herc facility ive watched every video ive forgotten how long or at what amount of people i subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago but i want to thank you guys for everything youre doing pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers chemists physicists and rocket scientists keep up the amazing work cant wait for the we amputated this guys limbs and turned him into darth vader video but seriously you guys are awesome
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists been watching for a very long time around 4 years goodluck hacksmith
i am curious as to how theyll manage sabers clashing its been long theorizedand more or less confirmed in rebels that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact maybe theyll be able to utilize something to that regard
i love how casually he said lets play with liquid oxygen immediately after telling us how dangerous it is exactly what id expect from a sciengineeringinfotainment channel
how far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
while watched you earlier you were just making marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
now  the hacksmith is like an industry
too happy for you my man
keep going
hacksmith is doing something that even large companies wouldnt do big respect
the team at hacksmith industries actually do things that most people dont even think of its crazy 
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational maybe youre less stressed now or something but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends
i truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility you can see engineering past present and future in your labs
you guys are awesome and are living the dream so happy that you are allowing all us nerds this awesome experience hope everything continues to go well",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT16M51S,"['the use liquid oxygen actually perfect because somebody assembles his lightsaber wrong will quite literally explode just like the lore', '', 'edit tysm for the like', 'imagine getting robbed and then you whip out lightsaber', 'get minisaber for off for limited time the discount automatically applied check out when you click through the youtube shopping shelf you cannot see the shopping shelf try disabling your blocker thank you for supporting and our journey make real working lightsabers', '', 'these guy really push the limit what possible', 'happy see youtube sponsoring this video you definitely deserve proud how far you have come hope you take the time appreciate what you have built now and then', 'bought one the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign and absolutely amazing used for few hour the 4th july and had issue did not_ even have refill', 'sweet celestia love the logo design with aperture science', '', 'and say accurate because you guy are the embodiment science about why not_', '', 'also love how the video are feeling now and really excited seeing more content', 'fun personal experience for about year worked silicon wafer manufacturing facility with class clean room perfume cologne makeup even deodorant allowed the people working there and skin exposed everybody had wear full body suit that were sealed and goggles that even had small air filter them', '', 'james have got say that you have accidentally made feel emotional during this episode this episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come the year that have been watching your video and watching the legacy you have literally built into today sincerely and eagerly await see great future for you and your team def bought minisabre too', 'not_ starwars fan more pirate the caribbean guy but loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic amazing project with amazing team', 'know one will see this but just want say how amazing you guy are from your garage the herc facility have watched every video have forgotten how long what amount people subscribed you guy because long ago but want thank you guy for everything you are doing pushing the boundary and inspiring generation engineer chemist physicist and rocket scientist keep the amazing work cannot wait for the amputated this guy limb and turned him into darth vader video but seriously you guy are awesome', 'they started off from making fun silly invention literally becoming self taught scientist been watching for very long time around year goodluck hacksmith', 'curious how they will manage saber clashing been long theorizedand more confirmed rebel that saber utilize magnetic element keep the blade intact maybe they will able utilize something that regard', 'love how casually said let play with liquid oxygen immediately after telling how dangerous exactly what expect from sciengineeringinfotainment channel', 'how far the hacksmith came mind blowing', 'while watched you earlier you were just making marvel item real life and then destroying stuff montage', 'now the hacksmith like industry', 'too happy for you man', 'keep going', 'hacksmith doing something that even large company would not_ big respect', 'the team hacksmith industry actually thing that most people not_ even think crazy', 'not_ know why but the overall vibe your video really settled into something fun and inspirational maybe you are stressed now something but feel relaxed like hanging out with cool friend', 'truly admire your channel for engineering ingenuity and credibility you can see engineering past present and future your lab', 'you guy are awesome and are living the dream happy that you are allowing all nerd this awesome experience hope everything continues well']",1011

i remember before she was famous  she was doing covers on youtube  now look at far she made it  just amazing
never heard of her but this asmr is better than 70 of actual asmr channels

you can totally see shes enjoying this  love her music and asmr and the video was so long which i loved
i love how serious tate is excited to see her career grow much further im sure she has a very bright future ahead of her
omg ms tate should get into making asmr as a side gig she would kill it
okay but the jacket sounds are soo relaxing she killed this 
i really appreciate that she took asmr seriously its so annoying and rude when other celebrities dont
you know the asmr is elite when youre not even wearing headphones and you get tingles 
as someone who loves asmr and tate this is the best video everrrr
i remember watching videos of her original songs when i was 9 or 10 and now im about to be 17 shes made it so far and she deserves everything she has and more shes great at asmr too
i havent listened to her in years but shes grown so much were almost 2 years apart but i still feel like a proud mother gonna stream her albums
shes so good at it and the candle lighting portion with the words of reassurance the smirk and eye roll saying relax i am now convinced shes watched some asmr before
this is such a good asmr video she seems so natural at it got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough 
she needs to make her own asmr broo the crispiness of her whispers and binaural technique is so good
i am begging for whoever edits these videos to make the part where they do asmr with the w magazine longer it is so satisfying and one of my fav parts but always gets cut short
wow this is cool she not only has a great singing voice she has a incredible whispering voice so soothing and soft fabulous tmcrae she impresses in every wayall the time so talented love it

lyrics
i told you id rise up
 
youd be mistaken if you thought i was gone
cause ive been waiting for this moment too long whoa
just to see the worry in your eyes
 
i bet you thought that i had fallen away
it never crossed your mind that thered be a day whoa
id return to look you in the eyes
 
dont pray for me you said theres no hope in forgiving
your happy to just leave me for the dead
well time has passed im very much the living
and all thats left is to leave you seeing red 
 
so when you think youve got me by a thread
you need think again
cause i know you never thought that this would be how it ends
i told you id rise up
 
i dont believe that you have got any soul
youre just a breed of your own kind all alone whoa
an architect of your own decline
 
nothings sacred anymore thats the past
its falling further even more out of grasp whoa
youre replaced and running out of time
 
no prayers from me you see im not the one you think will
just let it go and leave it all behind
youre dead to me and i dont even feel guilt
just take a look cause its time for me to rise
 
so when you think youve got me by a thread
you need think again
cause i know you never thought that this would be how it ends
i told you id rise up
 
i dont want to close my eyes
i can never get enough
like the sun its time that i rise up
 
so when you think youve got me by a thread
you need think again
cause i know you never thought that this would be how it ends
i told you id rise up
 
riseup sum41 rock",1364,"2 songs out now and both are so fucking sick we will miss u sum41 amazing work
i love how you decided to close your career going back to your most true roots but keeping all the stuff you went through these years in it its like a twentyfive long nostalgia ride and its fkin awesome
i gonna miss a lot this band when they end promoting this last album being a fan since kid and grow up listening to them its an invaluable thing for me
sum 41 forever 
i cannot believe you are going to retire when you can still release so many more bangers i know you have your very valid personal reasons but damn what the world is going to miss is incredible thank you for all these years this last album is turning out absolutely spectacular you will go with a bang 
this is definitely a very sum 41 song somehow they manage to make this music inbetween metalish pop punk vibe cant wait to listen to the rest of the album
omg this song is so good  i dont believe it to put scream in a sum41 song might be a first no   and the clip is so fun i m glad seeing the sums having fun together  cheers 
crazy song and video probably one of the best in describing the essence of the sums and their flexibility with fast paced riffs catchy chorus melodic moment and epic solo by dave 
   
these guys have been blowing my mind since i was 12 im 34 now i just woke up what an awesome  bandsong to wake up to 
sum 41 never misses  thank you for all the amazing music youve put out thru out the years yall really got me thru some rough shit and some not so rough shit too haha  sum 41 really was all killer no filler after all 
amazing as usual i will be playing this on repeat until the album drops i am so excited for the tour 
theyre backthats what we want what the hell good vibes so amazing thanks guyss  see u on  stage  soon
i have always wonder how you can combine so much styles in one song awesome 
que som destruidor agora sim mandou muitoooooooooooo  3 3 3  assim que tem que ser sum 41 gigante eu senti um poder incrvel ouvindo essa msica 3 3 3
sum 41 just dropped this track and it hit me right in the feels and the gut  talk about a heart and gut combo  absolute vibes that resonate deep down 
damn yet another banger from these guys im super excited for the full album 
la banda est cerrando su carrera con broche de oro tremenda cancin que geniales esos cambios de ritmo la cancin es perfecta me llena bastante el corazn que estn sacando tan buenas canciones para su ltimo lbum sum 41 fue mi primera banda favorita y la nostalgia se siente a full

love these videos sm grace classic grackle would love to see you trying vegan christmas options as a throwback to your dairy free days 3
your reactions to foods you dont like are the best  those facial expressions
we had a party recently with loads of party food from different shops including the mini burgers from sainsburys and yes they are super tiny but so yummy safe to say they were gone instantly  waitrose has a nice fresh food party selection that you can preorder they also do lush mini mince pies x
these videos never get oldand it wouldnt seem like christmas without them thanks so much darling and merry christmas to you and your hubby 
these are like a tradition of mine  i watch them every year without fail and often during the year when i miss those winter wonderland vibes 
a pigs in blankets rollbapsandwich is my go to weekend breakfast during the festive season  cant go wrong
the sainsburys chocolate and salted caramel bar actually comes out of the plastic just fine whilst its frozen so dont loose hope on it everyone
youre literally helping me so much with your eating videos especially around christmas time 
i am so jealous of how clear your skin is omg i cant even look at dairy gluten or sugar without my skin erupting  thoroughly enjoyed this vlog tho ily 
it would be super cool if you could make a similar video but with vegan christmas food options need your opinions
about the freshly baked in store it usually means that the product arrives frozen to the shop and they bake it so its not baked in store at all just heatedfully baked because it arrives par baked weve been duped
a mince pie review from all the different supermarkets could be cool maybe another great opportunity to feature papa booth xx
every time i watch a grackle video i think how can someone be so classy yet so messy at the same time she is gorgeous and we are blessed with her content 
agree with you so much about fruit teas the smell makes me expect a flavour explosioonnnn and no matter how long i brew it i just get a tickle of the flavour compared to the smell
loved this love these every year can you do a christmas recipes tiktok christmas hacks video and maybe a christmas around the world video talking about the traditions of different cultures i loved your videos of the 50s and other decades where thered be research and things im loving vlogmas thank you for making christmas 2023 
i always find that fruit teas benefit from the addition of a neutral flavoured sweetener white sugar rather than honeymaple and it really enhances the taste
classics are good so please keep these up  your vibe is so fun and happy  keep being awesome
i remember last year time you had that santa butter and dear mama grack said to save it til christmas eve and now you can eat him early in your own home  xx

",6679,"i dont have enough words to say how great this segment was the stare down between seth and punk made people go insane
perfect feud no heel or face just two people with genuine hate and respect at the same time
half the crowd singing seths theme and the other half chanting for punk gives me chills this feud will truly feed families i cant wait for this match
that stare down and crowd reaction sent chills down my spine weve waited 10 years for this
the tension the split crowd the history between them this story is worthy of a wrestlemania main event spot which for both is long overdue
this rivalry will be looked back on in 30 years as legendary and iconic
this segment right here this is what will ultimately pin cody up vs roman while punk and seth have this going on this was powerful and a precursor of things to come the best wwe has been in years and we have hhh to thank for it
thats your one pass to stand here and speak to me disrespectfully without me coming after you
 cm punk
having seth and punk on the same show after everything thats happened is just incredible both guys with genuine dislike for one another but also two guys who love wrestling i truly believe once its all said and done both guys will bury the hatchet and become civil
i dont think ive ever heard a crowd trying to chant four different things at once from literally just a stare down this is legendary
this was insane their rivalry is going to be legendary
wrestling is back loved this the fine line between acting and reality drama hope wwe keeps on this path would be great if some of the others learn from these two this is what weve been missing
this is definitely a feud of a generation and its actually dope how both punk and rollins have used punks aew drama that wasnt his fault might i add to make it as good as it is both when punk talked about him and owens beating people up backstage and seth borrowing from hangmans promo
meu deus do cu essa encarada de seth e cm punk foi na verdade uma briga velada
give these 2 their first main event spot at wrestlemania 
the tension in this segment was insane this is about to be a hell of a feud
this brought me back to those solid emotional staredown segments from back in the day
this was one of the best segments in a very long time i like serg when hes not over the top this felt real punk has definitely made watching wwe live must see again
the face of punk when seths music started priceless

 gaming lego fortnite",584,"extra tip carry 6 planks with you always you can 1 craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools including the grappler which makes it actually useful or 2 craft a bed once you get to the right town level which as already stated is good for respawns alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you
hiya guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold

regarding tip 12 with the grappler
thank you everyone for the comments i wasnt aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 
it may get patched soon though

really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code rugg in the item shop
thank you all so much for the support 
more lego fortnite videos will be coming later this week
major tips read this
something to keep in mind if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest it resets the grappler back to 10 uses it makes the grappler very work getting

another tip if you take the barrels of tnt found near old broken down buildings  and throw them into clusters of trees or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while im only at 3rd village lvl great video as always
for heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
if you keep a hearty charm on it can negate low temp or high temp damage you remain at full hp you get the temp hearts so long as your at the first layer of hotcold the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10 it usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used i also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return edit just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up
suggestion i explored my map a bit with nothing on me whenever i came across something interesting i would pick up small stones nearby make a marker and place it there that way i could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything then whenever im ready id gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that i can immediately go to
great tip with the grappler you dont have to break the chest put it in and take it out unfortunately not the same for tools
as of now when it comes to dying of starvation heat or cold there is a way to negate all of them with one item it allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though i took fire damage the entire time there is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if youre already full health and it regenerates itself very quickly meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation heat or cold itll regenerate it self this allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game especially in regards to those desert caves
more tips 1 instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools just craft a traditional counter under counters as it only costs 8 wood 

2 the grapplers uses can be refreshed just like your tools except its even easier you dont even need to break whatever chestcounter youve built just throw it in a storage thing take it out and its refreshed
thanks for the great tips

my tip is for people starting a new server in survival set up a different server with the same seed in sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town
i actually would suggest making a grappler it got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit 751
i dont know if anyone said this yet but you dont actually need cool headed charms for the desert if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you dont lose your temporary hearts and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back
you can find sand shells at the beachtropical coast areas access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations
craft the grappler it only sucks because it has 10 uses but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as theres so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect
heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers assign them to threading if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
i would say its for sure worth making the grappler just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land you can do the durability glitch w the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when youre fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
fun fact you can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out  aim at the highest point of a tree and itll work perfectly with the

the last time olivia rodrigo performed a tiny desk concert it was two years ago in a deserted dmv office back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldnt play the real desk but this year the singersongwriter returned bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the npr music office its much cooler to be here rodrigo says i was saying earlier ive never been starstruck by a room before

many of the songs on guts which earned a special recommendation on npr musics best albums of 2023 list blow out rodrigos sound into colorful grungy poprock fit for a stadium like love is embarrassing performed here with rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar but the artist builds her set out with guts cuts that fit the intimate setup like the searing vampire her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines or the potent ode to female jealousy lacy which rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class by the end of her set shes completely alone at the piano for the sobering making the bed and its not difficult to see why shes one of pops most promising rising performers

nprmusic tinydesk oliviarodrigo",2938,"making the bed is so underrated its my fav
tiny desk and snl in the same weekend she is crushing it
her voice is so consistent with her album recordings that alone is so impressive
can we just also appreciate the band and the supporting vocalists they are amazing
set list
0002 love is embarrassing
0415 vampire
0922 lacy
1336 making the bed
lacy and making the bed contain some of olivias most deeply introspective and creatively complexed lyrics on the guts album  lacy vividly defines the internal experience of envy and poetically describes the psychological and emotional tugofwar raging inside of someone that both worships and despises another person who has become an obsession  making the bed defines the internal struggle of accepting the inevitable side effects that come with getting everything that one wants while holding oneself responsible for the decisions that lead to negative results  olivia has said in interviews that she is proud of the songs on guts that explore other topics outside of heartbreak and both of these songs reveal the expanding imagery and specificity of her writing that is both real and relatable especially when performed live
i still have not recovered from the cathartic snl performance and olivia strikes again with four of my favorite songs from guts love the drama and the vocals in each of these songs
want to play your own tiny desk concert unsigned musicians enter the 2024 tiny desk contest between jan 23 and feb 21 learn more httpsnprorgtinydeskcontest
the reason why i like this album so much is because i think it achieves what every artist hopes their followup album will  she is a very mature songwriter and you can hear her mature with her lyrics sour was fun and represented her age very well and i think guts does the samebut she has applied her deeper understanding of herself to her writing and has expressed some of her emotions more vulnerably while still remaining integral to her personal style which initially popularized her even lacy explores the concept of jealously on a much more intricate level than some of the songs on her previous album this is a beautiful second album and such a fluid transition from sour im excited to see what else she puts out in the future
its just incredible how she has a beautiful voice even when she has no auto tune or edits its amazing and an anomaly truly

quick edit ahhh almost 100 likes
 this was far and away one of the best performances by olivia ever finally she sang one of the best songs off guts making the bed which she sang beautifully also lacy was perfect too olivia is so gracious and polite its so refreshing
the energy and joy she puts into love is embarrassing really makes it stand out and come alive relative to the recorded version  shes having fun and it shows  all aree great of course
the personality the talent the kindness we truly made the right artist famous thank you olivia rodrigo 
she is absolutely incredible i love that she took a poetry class and it turned into a song making the bed blew me away
finally us love is embarrassing fans are getting to hear it performed its so good
her tiny desk performances are always so good
i love olivias voice interpretation lyrics and band all of them are just gorgeous at what they do this was one of the best tiny desks ive ever seen she totally deserves her grmmy nominations 
i felt like love is embarrassing was so underrated when it first came out and now she be opening her mini concerts with it im so happy 
this is such a fantastic performance only let down by the mic it is so hard to sing live but she flawlessly sung it

horror outro  httpssoundcloudcomshurkofficialhaunted",3284,"mark being so confident in his answers then immediately being told hes wrong by the game is honestly one of the funniest things
mark being so suspicious and running from a man whos just casually walking past him is oddly funny to me
mark giving a stranger the longest nickname gotta be my favourite part
mark doing an accidental jumpscare by doing the posters one at a time is hilarious to me
imagine this from the npcs perspective it must be hilarious you have another person who runs up yells at the walls screaming this is different and then runs in the opposite direction
i like how 90 seconds into this game marks already lost his mind calling a totally harmless bystander mr mustache receding hairline phone in left hand briefcase in right no socks white shirt black pants man
markiplier perfectly yet unintentionally summed up his content in one quote i have a feeling now that im gonna be utterly confident and then somethings going to go horrifically wrong 2120
mark blindly following the rule of hugging the left wall to an annoying degree but completely ignoring all the posters is such a weird dichotomy of rule followingbreaking
the briefcase guy oh no not this guy again just keep walkig john dont look at him dont say a word just go ahead and forget about him

mark anytime he sees him well well look who it is
mark doing the quick 180 after he sees the man smiling killed me
mark what did i do wrong
the most obvious door knob in the center of the door 
1210 so as we see there was indeed an anomaly that graphical glitch was indeed indicative of an anomaly he should have turned around for 
the anomaly was that the posters on the wall were growing the graphical glitch was the frame edge of the poster clipping through marks vision
we need the full uncut version of this gotta see mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for an hour
imagine youre just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keeps staring at you and when you finally decide to stare back they cut you off and dont let you continue walking  1248
mark should do more of these kind of games its funny how he gets frustrated
i love games like this nothing super flashy and there arent really any in your face jump scares but the way its set up and the ambiance messes with your head and starts making you more and more paranoid questioning everything
this is actually such a neat concept and one of the better games ive seen mark play
him missing the one that literally tells him to turn back is actually really funny idk why 
i like these types of lets plays because the audience can kind of play along
i usually dont enjoy these types of games but this one was so fun but this one had the looping element and the numbers to tell you if youre on the right track that made it so much fun for me especially since mark kept dying at the worst times getting to 8 so many times just to loop again is truly a nightmare this must be what hell is like",20,Gaming,36000000,PT36M39S,"['mark being confident his answer then immediately being told wrong the game honestly one the funniest thing', 'mark being suspicious and running from man who just casually walking past him oddly funny', 'mark giving stranger the longest nickname got favourite part', 'mark doing accidental jumpscare doing the poster one time hilarious', 'imagine this from the npc perspective must hilarious you have another person who run yell the wall screaming this different and then run the opposite direction', 'like how second into this game mark already lost his mind calling totally harmless bystander mustache receding hairline phone left hand briefcase right sock white shirt black pant man', 'markiplier perfectly yet unintentionally summed his content one quote have feeling now that going utterly confident and then something going horrifically wrong 2120', 'mark blindly following the rule hugging the left wall annoying degree but completely ignoring all the poster such weird dichotomy rule followingbreaking', 'the briefcase guy not_ this guy again just keep walkig john not_ look him not_ say word just ahead and forget about him', '', 'mark anytime see him well well look who', 'mark doing the quick 180 after see the man smiling killed', 'mark what did wrong', 'the most obvious door knob the center the door', '1210 see there indeed anomaly that graphical glitch indeed indicative anomaly should have turned around for', 'the anomaly that the poster the wall were growing the graphical glitch the frame edge the poster clipping through mark vision', 'need the full uncut version this got see mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for hour', 'imagine you are just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keep staring you and when you finally decide stare back they cut you off and not_ let you continue walking 1248', 'mark should more these kind game funny how get frustrated', 'love game like this nothing super flashy and there are not_ really any your face jump scare but the way set and the ambiance mess with your head and start making you more and more paranoid questioning everything', 'this actually such neat concept and one the better game have seen mark play', 'him missing the one that literally tell him turn back actually really funny not_ know why', 'like these type let play because the audience can kind play along', 'usually not_ enjoy these type game but this one fun but this one had the looping element and the number tell you you are the right track that made much fun for especially since mark kept dying the worst time getting many time just loop again truly nightmare this must what hell like']",2199

GB,sevVQaD_e0I,this minecraft base is not good actually,kenadian the catboy,2023-12-11T13:00:46Z,,424559,29368,"why are we still making most secure minecraft base videos in 2023
checks view count
oh



huge credit to avatardotpng for making 90 of this base with help from maximumg9 chessjames dwinkley calamitas wato and me

music
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi3as7woijds
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6652bghhh78",1708,"this is like watching a kids sandcastle being obliterated by 3kg of high explosive while the detonator is roasting the kid lmao
there is one thing all these youtubers should know

the only safe house in minecraft is a hidden one
mumbo jumbo
oh boy this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these 
yeah these safest bases are usually pathetically easy to enter their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create easy defenses that are redundant and pointless serving to introduce more vulnerability
i thought this base was really secure but then i had a very good idea i used f5 see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and i was able to see that this base was insecure
i knew he would debunk it eventually while watching i was like bro kenadian is going to destroy this lol
lesson learned next time you want to build a base watch out for kenadians in the wild
yer the base is kinda dumb it only works if you obey very specific rules and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare

all these safest bases just dont work without other mods commands datapacks etc to add additional mechanics

still thanks for showing just how easy it is
when kenadian is bored he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things
1 im glad carvs was a good sport about this its always nice to see someone who can take a joke
2 i was thinking the exact same things when i was watching his video i was like couldnt someone just fly or build through this whole thing this design seems super exploitable
someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools damn this is a safe base
kenadian beating it without taking damage hold my beer
231 322 i love the little detail of while hes explaining why this base is actually secure hes just chilling in the middle of the danger zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
this safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremodenew to minecraft
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
i looked at this base and thought it was very secure but then i had a very good idea  i used blocks see using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armorpotions simple
the fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point mad respect
is easier to destroy than to create no base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base
i was already impressed but the half a heart challenge was the cherry on top for me well done

you lads should definitely make more of these thinking of other programmes like what not to wear changing rooms dinner date worlds strictest parents wife swap and the nanny
the editing on this is unbelievably good hahaha
no one ever reacts to four in a bed its so good funny and even worse than come dine with me for arguments nothing sets off 40 year olds more than marking them a 3 because you found some dust on a lamp at their bnb  big brother shouldve been here too that show is a mess 
i love this duo with all my heart 
say what you will about lorraine and her crumble song as soon as i saw her come up the song came back into my head before she started singing and i hadnt seen her performance since it first aired years ago shes a maverick and an exceptional songwriter
honestly as someone with an eating disorder growing up watching all of these shows supersize vs super skinny was incredibly enabling for me but the premise of the show wouldve actually helped me if someone had taken me not kidnapping professional help when i was younger before it got serious and put me in the same position as the people on that show without cameras and i saw what i would do to myself if i carried on and was able to see someone with the opposite problems perspective on myself and vice versa im still working through things now with a dietitian but i havent relapsed fully in 2 years now and im healthier for it i just wish i was caught earlier on by either my parents or teachers before it went really bad and i spent the majority of secondary in an office with a nurse at lunch once a week talking to a person from an eating disorder clinic over skype and getting my bmi and bloods taken thanks to my friends in school i honestly dont think id still be here without them
i know youre not used to being told about things being a decent length but finally weve  got a video of a good length  good editing and a great duo

can we get a cover of ablisas singing on the useless tour 

im sorry but the crumble woman is great thats british eccentricity at its finest we need that fun confidence and friendly madness more than ever now 

george saying why would you say that on the take me out bit  mate do you remember your 100 v 1 video by any chance  that guy did definitely say the wrong thing but he can at least talk to females 

embarrassing bodies was great and horrific in equal parts  fat families was simply amazing 

the jeremy kyle show was a mixed bag imo sometimes it did seem to help people other times though it did go too far plus it was quite sad when blatant sexism etc was highlighted like the guy who was laughed at by the audience for saying he had to jump out a window to escape his abusive girlfriend overall though it definitely wasnt nearly as wild as the jerry springer show that was crazy theyd do stuff like bring on dwarfs to fight bonkers really 
we definitely need a follow up to this naked attraction and take me out 
come on ann lets get you home haha 
stephen  georges reactions make my day so much when youve lost your job  will be spending most days alone its always nice to watch these videos with these 2 in  they make me so happy  cosy  
i love stephen so much so naturally funny 
great vid a part 2 vid could include the inbetweeners and jeremey kyle plenty more iconic british tv shows
havent even finished watching yet but i know its gunna be so good keep up the great work lads
these shows make me feel so much better about my train wreck of a life
as an aussie who watched a crazy amount of uk kids tv shows a 2000s2010s kids tv show version of this would be epic
you missed sun sea and suspicious parents thats a proper british classic

not going to lie the build up to xmas just isnt the same without a new geowizard adventure to follow  leep them coming mate theyre some of the best videos on yt
these adventure videos for the past couple years have always made my day so much better your style of editing music choice and relaxing narration feels so cozy honestly tom youve really inspired me with these adventures to get out there and do them myself as a 17 year old living in the boring state of illinois with no car its a bit tougher for me to do things like this but i surely will someday hopefully sooner rather than later
tom is the embodiment of a grandma saying why would you want to go to australia when there are parts of birmingham you havent seen yet

i love the chill nature of this one its quite nice not to be listening out for screaming farmers chasing you down for once and incredibly reassuring knowing youll circumvent any bogs  honestly id gladly watch regular hikingcamping videos if you did them just you out exploring discovering cool new places with all the lemonade you could wish for in your backpack
mad props to tom for being able to keep so many of us glued to our screens by simply just walking in the english countryside cant wait for part two
massive shout out to the shrewsbury arms i hope at least some of the people watching this video will seek out that pub and bring their custom as a thank you for that ladys kindness
best youtuber on the planet no money involved just pure adventure and exploration in the endless fields of the uk serious talent making these videos so compelling to watch and also inspiring for other adventurers alike
i love how popular toms videos are because he doesnt put on a fake persona or overdo it its just pure adventure exploration and joyful content and i really appreciate it keep being an awesome guy tom
i always get excited for these adventure videos you have inspired me to wander around the peak district where i live making up my own challenges ever since the og wales line cant wait for episode 2 it looks like you passed through butterton in the intro but could be wrong heres a tenner to fund the next one keep exploring my dude
this man delivers some of the best videos on youtube the sense of adventure is so real someone needs to get him a tv show
i love that the emphasis in the preamble is on a more leisurely approach and sticking to pathsand yet by about 5 minutes in tom is clawing his way through hedgerows and getting stung by nettles 
ive been watching you for a while i didnt know we lived so close you walked straight past our family farm and through a few of our neighbours farmsfields 
our fields maybe be private land but aslong as you are respectful and leave nothing but footprints and take nothing but photos your more than welcome friend was such a pleasure to see our area on youtube

redfalcon gaming mario",475,"wubbas fate is still tragic but congrats to the winner what a welldeserved victory
that was a masterpiece a total rollercoaster of emotions even the man with no tear ducts that cant cry shed tears for our fallen warriors we love you hoppy and rip metal mario the original under dog
this one is special to us i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible 
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops that was a wild vid
even though hoppy cat won congrats to medal mario for being the underdog
this video is the true definition of tragic i rooted for metal mario the whole way through but he came just short but congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory
why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream cant wait for the faster mario kart to become a vid 
but how far can the hoppycat go
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did he deserved first he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection even if metal mario only got second he had to work for it im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it werent for that level and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
mods are already so crazy im so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds
the fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasnt possible is impressive itself
this is crazy i havent seen the end yet but this is gonna be interesting every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting
as a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win
you should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go and i already know hell be going to world 4 at least since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels i was rooting for them and am so happy they won
id love to see hoppycat beat the game always love the little enemies
great video so many twists and turns as a long time red falcon fan i must say im loving these new videos and editing style
wonder how far the wubba wouldve made it if water levels werent required i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game

GB,PDMIFXW5QB0,colossal sea monster unearthed in uk  bbc news,bbc news,2023-12-10T17:19:42Z,"bbc,bbc news,news,world news,breaking news,us news,world,america,usa,usa news,india news",1467253,23397,"the skull of a colossal sea monster has been extracted from the cliffs of the jurassic coast in dorset uk

it belongs to a pliosaur a ferocious marine reptile that terrorised the oceans about 150 million years ago

the 2mlong fossil is one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered and is giving new insights into this ancient predator

the skull will be featured in a special david attenborough programme on bbc one on new years day

palaeontology seacreatures bbcnews",3906,"wonderful to see sir david attenborough still active  bless you
thats looks like what a dragonskull would look like thats awesome
beside the big fossil lets not forget to admire the smaller one the amazing 97 year old sir david still standing tall rocking the boat telling us about it
early sailors may have found things like this and imagined sea monsters were still alive in the oceans thiis is amazing 
my god im a fisherman in california and ive just realized that i sold a huge squid beak to steve etches several years ago  he contacted me one day through my online ad saying he wanted one for his museum  i had totally forgotten his name until i saw this report  so honored to have one of my specimens on display in his collection to be viewed by hopefully many generations to come
paleontologists dream find i dont think this short story can adequately cover the magnitude of how incredible this discovery was and how serious steve etches is when he says he could spend the rest of his life with this fossil
the amount of human and natural history in the uk is mind blowing 
wow really amazing how well the skull is preserved the teeth look amazing i hope they find the whole fossilized pliosaur
the jurassic coast is known for its rich fossil record and this discovery is certainly significant
yes that is an amazing piece of history and a magnificent animal indeed but guys sir david attenborough is 97 years old and hes on a swaying boat that makes most young people seasick it is sir david attenborough that is the true beast of nature here folks seriously
fantastic as a child i was fascinated with dinosaurs and their cousins this still brings me joy 
glad to see sir david attenborough healthy and still contributing to the world of documentaries i was some how emotional seeing him in this video
if this was how terrifying life looked like millions of years ago on earth imagine whats out there in the universe in different shapes and forms absolutely fascinating
and this dwarfs the entire human existence  huge respect to these species to be able to go beyond millions of years
amazingly well preserved for a skull that big most of the time they are crushed to pieces and some of the pieces are just gone
i am in awe of this find having spent a few hours wandering along beaches on the jurassic coast i can imagine how excited the man who discovered this must have been 
fantastic find and a beautiful specimen
was great to be a part of this project hosting sir david attenborough on our boat snapper charters was a real career highlight
this reminds me a bit of that incredible ankylosaur fossil that was basically perfectly preserved pretty much the whole body not just the head 

and to think that fossilization in and of itself is already a very rare thing to start with and then to have a fossil like this is indeed incredible i cant recall the statistic on this but fossilization is a process that occurs only something like 5 of the time any living animal dies maybe less even if we were to unearth all the fossils from the crust of our planet today it would only represent a very small fraction of all the possible animal species  that quite possibly  well never know about because its possible that not a single specimen went through a successful fossilization process
i love this stuff  i contemplated paleontology for a bit but instead went for my masters in biological anthropology  i always geek out about these findings

jacob is a phenomenal actor
lou vic and jake on one episode of game changer thats 100 going to be a banger
i love getting all worked up for a new dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
the way my heart caught in my throat when jacob started yelling at sam
love that bdg is doing a lot of stuff with dropout nowadays
i cant tell you how excited i am to see nathan on dropout again please please please more collabs with the drawfee hosts their gremlin energy is just what i need 
seeing nathan actually makes me a little emotional drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropoutch but im glad to see some drawfeedropout mixing is still possible
i saw jacob storm out and then the tv says do something great for the trailer i mean i had to pause the trailer because i started dying of laughter
well jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 
the fact that i was not scared at all jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of dropout
more vic more brennan meltdowns and more grant skin yes please also i love how upset a producer was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos 
bdg sungwon and nathan the already incredible cast is only getter better 
im so excited
im stoked as always and i just wanted to say that the that should cut good shows such respect for your audience and we hardly ever see that in reality tv nicely done yall
bdg and sungwon graduating from make some noise to game changer proper plus caldwell and nathan making their game changer debuts oh yeah this is gonna be a good season
love how the marketingthroughline of this series keeps getting slightly more horrorthriller with each season
jesus jacobs acting legitimately got me there for a second
im so relieved jacob wasnt actually upset i teared up a bit lol
im so excited for nathan drawfee hopefully this will lead to more drawfeedropout crossovers in the future i need some more snilk and drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
im so excited to see nathan as a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan im happy to see you folks doing stuff together even after drawfee went independent i hoped thered be some crossovers still and im not disappointed i see why you didnt have karina shes too powerful although shed rock in a yugioh episode of um actually

what a game from son stick him up front and he plays like the second best striker in the league and out wide hes still the same old sonny people said he cant play wide anymore as hes lost it but what a performance  never seen trips get turned inside out like that
son has stepped up to the plate incredibly well since kane left hes truly their talisman now what a player
son was unbelievable wreaking havoc down that left flank
pape sarr was unbelievable today his presence in midfield definitely affected the way we played
he was intercepting everywhere  and constantly trying to start attacks
my man of the match along with son
the way sonny delivered those first two goals for his team  simply worldclass a pseudo hat trick for sonny in my books
fair play to spurs they were on fire today also ange is always a class act no matter the result
sons loyalty to spurs is almost unimaginable
as a newcastle fan we were awfulbut good on spurs they easily deserved the full points zero complaints
this is probably the most unpredictable premier league season i can remember for a long time
unbelievable defending from davies at the beginning couldve completely changed the game if he didnt do that
its been so painful as a spurs fan seeing all these 21 losses win meant a lot today coys
tottenham are so lucky to have a player like son genuinely hes an alltime premier league in my eyes 
as a newcastle fan you can only respect son he had us on toast for the full 90
i think son is everyones favourite player outside of their own club just a great player and a likeable dude
toon fan spurs were awesome today really great attacking play and pressing like we dowhen we arent knackered hope spurs do well from here hopefully we get some players back soon
porro its a decent ball if the likes of de bruyne played that ball it would be described as world class porros passing is incredible
spurs had sarr back and that made a difference his energy and drive  helps the tempo of the game ange using son on the left was masterful son knows to drive and get the cross in not bass in backwords kulu in the middle work as he couldnt slow the game down by cutting in  johnson had a better game too  perro was outstanding spurs have nf and everton next two games they should get a win when they get there full team back can really see spurs going on a long unbeaten run
richarlison really delivering was unexpected  good for him  its about time

sean dyche is doing a brilliant job at everton
congrats to chelsea for beating newcastle 20 despite this 
as a football fan i love to see the underdogs winning a game unfortunately i didnt get to see that today
sean dyche deserves so much respect for the job hes doing at everton
to think everton would be in the top half if it werent for the deduction 
doucure needs his flowers he consistently leaves his blood sweat and tears on the pitch in every game the passion youd think he came up from their academy its soo rare for me to see the grit he shows
as a chelsea fan we are a shambles but well done everton you deserve the  credit for getting out the bottom 3
proud of lewis dobbin was here at derby on loan last season and what a player he is his talent is coming to fruition
im a liverpool fan but cmon everton well done lads that was top class work especially after the ridiculous 10 point deduction your absolutely smashing back in there faces fair play 
i love my club  they may have put us through the mill over the past couple of years but we somehow managed to just keep our heads above water and dodge relegation

go into this season looking like a completely different and rejuvenated team only to then get stung with a 10 point deduction

the way the team has responded since that barring the man utd result has been nothing short of outstanding

8 days 3 games played 3 games won 6 goals scored no goals conceded

utft 
im a liverpool fan and i cant explain how much i hate the premier league for the 10 point deduction its ridiculous its actually nice to see everton playing well no real football fan wants to see them go down
got to say hats off to dyche the lads  the supporters of everton football club after the shady 10 point deduction in the middle of a season yous have a responded brilliantly everton fans deserve this from a mackem next best thing to a safc win is an everton win
not an everton supporter but loving the fight this team has given recent point deduction 
it is sooo good to see everton back to winning against small teams like chelsea after that 10 point deduction
lfc fan since 1995 here
well done lads well done
you showed real class and true passion of the game
massive respect for everton and dyche from a liverpool supporter
if everton hadnt been deducted those points they would be mid table by now theyve been magnificent and hats off to them and their fans i hope they have a great season
happy for both everton fanbase and sean dyche after the 10 point reduction didnt let their heads down and doing the business

man i just hope this shit is entertaining like im sleep deprived and nervous as hell right now ngl but if you see this i hope u enjoy the vid and have the best holidays see u next year for jacob patch 137 that finally adds raytracing to my lil tiny assjarby 3
honestly bethesda owes modders millions for fixing their games all these years
quick update had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the house building song from rdr2 all i basically say is that the bounty system in starfield is even worse than rdr2 and being a pirate is so discouraged its borderline impossible anyways thanks so much for watching this video  i was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it  big ups to the whole island 
jacob
an amazing and high quality video as always jakey i seriously appreciate you mentioning how good skyrims ost is since thats like the king of music for me fyi the audio cuts out at 2948  3005 and 3015  3023
really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing the flow the script the scene choices the cutaway timing all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same new but nostalgic this is a huge development in the nakeyjakey career path maybe getting a bit wiser  cant wait to see a new video in like 3 years
1655 as a parent of a toddler seeing this ms rachel spoof sent me it was really well done and to be clear we absolutely adore ms rachel in my house
for a year before starfields launch my manager couldnt stop talking about it he would go on and on about how it was everything hes ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched

last week he came poked his head out from the other room and asked what was the name of that space game we used to play dude couldnt even remember the name of it anymore now granted my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid his favorite movie of all time is battlefield earth i know but i still feel like this means something
that clip of todd howard saying how he told everyone hed make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
dear jacob

another fantastic video as always i really liked the style of cinematography in this one it was obviously different than your usual style but thats not a bad thing by any means it felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend 

ive been following your content since 2017  went all the way through high school and am starting college now always looking forward to the next jarby video thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us and enjoy the holidays
an entire town wanting you dead in skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly but the idea that starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what youve done is the funniest thing ive heard all week
i think the signs were there a long time agoi played es4 oblivion extensivelywasnt perfect but i still had a lot of fun with itwhen skyrim came out i was hyped but i never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after i got it it was exceptionally underwhelming i still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line eg i always preferred dark brotherhood and thieves guild storyline over fighting dragons then something has gone terribly wrong
something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every unexplored frontier planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it im not exploring and finding something new im just playing tourist it would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot 35
thank you for finally putting into words why i just could not get into starfield i am a huge bethesda fan  i have been playing skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes along with the fallout games i wanted to love starfield so much but after a few hours i just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there i also think youre one of the few people who shares my opinion on fallout 3s atmosphere vs new vegas so i appreciate the nod to that as well
starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isnt fun and theres like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn
3333 funny thing about the item vacuum in jail the items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower early game its actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared lock pick your stuff back then be on your way

sculpting is a difficult thing to do with chocolate painting on a canvas with chocolate is easier kenz would have done equally good if she also decided to paint with chocolate but cant say for the guy who won if he would have chosen to sculpt

davids piece was just so beautiful for being made out of melted chocolate like dayum i honestly loved mackenzies piece as well it was just so detailed and amazing looking and i feel like if she wasnt punished so much she wouldve definitely had enough time to make a full body to attach to the head to make it look even more epic than it already did and it seriously wouldve been a hard decision and a super close win i honestly really loved michelles piece it was just super adorable and honestly deserved top 3 3
davids painting is amazing  love his style  michelles squid and mackenzies dino skeleton was really good and realistic

1128 f1 race week

1723 f1 vs the world",4693,"a few notes

1 the plank of wood under the car isnt actually wood its a plank of resin with titanium blocks skid blocks in certain parts of the plank this is where the sparks come from when they skid across the ground

2 kers is a bit dated  its just ers now lol thats because while there is kinetic energy recovery from braking mguk motor generator unit  kinetic there is also energy recovery from the exhaust gasses mguh motor generator unit  heat

3 drs was brought in for 2011 because with the newer cars in 2010 it was basically too difficult to overtake so this was an aid when the driver behind is within 1 second they gain access to drs to try and make the pass the regulations state that the current drs gap can be maximum of 85mm so any larger than this  disqualification

awesome video marques thanks for bringing our awesome sport to so many more people 
drs was never a feature only used by one team which then spread to others from the start 2011 it was mandated by the fia in order to counter the negative effects of dirty air when following another car and as such promote more overtaking and therefore more exciting races it could never have been developed by an individual team anyway because it wouldve represented a movable part which affected aerodynamics  something that has been banned in f1 since the 1960s
407 also a quick note to new f1 fans the halo was designed by mercedes for the fia and was built using titanium encased within carbon fibre not iron
it can withstand the weight of a doubledecker bus or the equivalent of around 12000kg
now u gotta get a sim rig going got into f1 a few years ago now and been loving it awesome video
great video marques the actual race itself was so fun
hello marques i come from germany and have been watching formula 1 for over 40 years and still love it today i give you a big applause for this video very good short but also detailed explanation of the topic i think that the future formula 1 series with andretti will have a big impact on the popularity of the sport in the usa thanks for doing this great youtube job love to see your videos 
glad that you are into f1 something not many people talk about is the skills talents and fitness level of these drivers and how they progressed through different categories before getting into the pinnacle of motorsports their offseason training is also incredibly cool
been watching f1 since 2012 i am glad you started following f1 as well as tech enthusias i am sure you will love it i think your describe it as science fair is the perfect description i always love to see how the car evolve from the start to the end of the season and you can notice how some team take design inspiration form other by looking and compare their car from different stage of the season
i was fortunate to go to a race 2 years ago i was at the end of turn 1 right after one of the fastest straights of the season it was like watching a fleet of star wars ships jumping out of hyperspace incredibly fast and then decelerating abruptly it was awesome
1235 it didnt just suck the manhole cover out of the ground it broke the cracked welds holding it in place 
it is great to see so many more people enjoying f1 now i speak from only being a fan for about a year so far and even in that time the audience is only getting bigger great video giving a breakdown of how the sport works marques
great video highlighting the geniuses behind f1

one other thing the 2020 season was delayed by 4 months due to covid but the teams utilised their engineers to help with pandemic by designing and manufacturing respiratory equipment
best f1 ever were the v10 motors i will never forget the first time i walked into catalunya circuit in spain 2005 the sound fire and energy you could literally feel coming out of those v10 engines and exhausts to this day still gives me chills when i think about it
great videoim happy you made it hopefully it will encourage a few people to check out a race i got into f1 a few years ago and look for every opportunity to introduce it to people its awesome to see it becoming more of a thing here in the states
as a f1 fan this is a great video i should sayvery simplified and generalized 
i have been blessed to be able to attend 2 race weekends in austin for the usgp its exactly as he said nothing compares to seeing it live and in person i sat on turn 15 so just after the straight away and through turns 1213 and 14 the amount of battles i saw coming through turns just to see these cars open up and hit near top speed going into the long right hander of turn 16 was truly amazing its an experience i tell everyone they need to have at least once in their life
i give you a very high salute for explaining this to those who are new to f1 and never knew the facts you explained so perfectly you now see that it is the highest technical form of auto racing i who have been a f1 fan since my childhood seen grow a very long way great job and im so glad to see you gain interest in f1 i have always enjoyed your content from when you started
im glad youre on board the f1 train
been watching f1 for at least 2 decades now and its fascinating data driven sports glad youve embraced it

liberty medias been successful in engaging more fans in the us thats great to see
whats not so great for those in the us is the timing of the sports given its mostly catered to the european audience but hey glad youve embraced f1
congrats marques ive been following the sport from the late 90s and love itim happy that you have now discovered this amazing spectacle and at one of the best races at very least year in los vegas it was incredibly dynamic and exciting so im very happy for you as a new fan that you got your introduction at that race which im sure will go down as a classic in f1 history  
could also mention how teams will experiment with all kinds of different parts during practice and will swap out several new ideas not all of which work and use flowvis which is a neon green liquid they spray on the car to see how the aerodynamics interact with the the air  otherwise really great intro to f1  i completely agree it is the world most competive tech science fair and its awesome to

can we just appreciate how good this season has been and were not even at christmas
nice to see ral jimnez performing consistently again after that horrific injury the guy was a monster during that 1920 wolves season
fulham brought back a 10 goal difference to 0 in just two games phenomenal stuff
the turn by wilson on the missed chance was sublime
credit to fulham they turned us over today an absolute masterclass from them fully deserved the 3points all 5 goals really well worked team display as a west ham fan not happy with the result but always a hard place to go to good luck to fulham for the remainder of the season
fulham fan here i have absolutely no idea whats going on but im loving it loving the ral jimenez redemption the most i dont want this to end
fulham transformation is insane villa and fulham has definitely been a shock for me
16 goals in the last 4 games for fulham 
raul jimenez is back to form you love to see it
loved that from wilson 4 goals up and a chance for a brace but did the right thing
what a win for fulham
as a west ham fan i had some terrible thoughts after this game but i do have to give credit to fulham scoring 10 in their last 2 and also conceding 0 fair play i guess
unselfish play when youre 40 up is always a mark of a true professional
its insane that they scored 10 in goals in 2 matches without conceding a goal they really are improving a lot better
marco silva hes a genius

since the international break weve scored 16 in 4 the entire rest of the season wed scored 10 in 12
willian has gone from looking finished in the brazilian league to being one of the pls most consistent wingers wow
hows nobody talking about harry wilson hes been so good this season
wilson such a team player and what a talent

too clean to use even down the road needs to be in a museum or bought by ford amazing thought has gone into this build
give him 9000 its just an extra 500 and he deserves it
what an amazing car its absolute madness that it didnt sell for 10k id say its worth 12k to a true fast ford enthusiast

great to see it on the channel 
as a life long ford fan this should be a 20k car unfortunately it isnt at the present time but definitely will be if kept the same in the future an outstanding car the owner should be beyond proud 
this is incredible full respect for making this what it is totally agree with the seats leather is the most over rated material when buying my golf i wanted the cloth 
85k  what a great price how he has not sold it for a higher price i dont know but as someone said its niche product george would be a fantastic ambassador and reviewer for your channel youve met some nice people along the way but hes the best get him on board i know they say dont mix your hobby with your job but hes way to passionate and knowledgeable about cars to not be working in the industry
think its a shame this going on planet of dreams this car is stunning and needs to go to a collector as not many left like that hope it goes to someone who  looks after it rather than rags it to death great video george seems a top fella and love the content calv
what an amazing job that looks bloody fantastic absolutely perfect for a little cruise on a dry summer day
not sure that putting it on pod is the right move though the chances of it being won by someone who will cherish it are bloody slim compared to the likelihood it will be won by someone who just thought they would have a go because its free such a shame
it might be an old focus st but its an absolute credit to the previous owner and there truly isnt many people who are this dedicated to the cause
thats one amazing st love it george has done a fantastic job on it what a guy  that sure is a car to cherish
in my time watching i have never seen cal this sort of speechless what an immaculate car major credit to him
i love nothing more then getting a car back to its best this guys is on another level well done sir
fair play to him building this car its not about what its worth its about the passion and love for cars i too have spent far too much on my own car and get told im crazy 

and fair play to you calv i dont know of another automotive youtuber that gives back as much to his followers as you proper diamond bloke 
incredible just incredible calv  what a true gem of a car i just pray that whoever is lucky enough to win this beauty will appreciate all the work thats been done on it and also what your sacrificing to just go and give it away instead of having it as a show piece at binca  where it would be safe and live on for years to come 
wow whar a cara proper labour of lovegeorge what a genuinely humble nice guy who with his passion for his car spared no cash for doing everything on the carwhoever wins this is getting one hell of a carlove the video calv bro
i think its an experience thing
like im 8k deep into modsupgrades on my 3 mps and although i wouldnt change a thing because ive enjoyed learning about all the things along the way and the experience of working on it to that degree if i decided to get another one later down the line id definitely spend a bit extra initially for one thats already had the work done 

its the enthusiast life i suppose so many others can relate

bayern were 50 up at half time in this fixture last season a slight improvement from frankfurt this time
this is incredible been a while since we saw bayern munich get manhandled like that
ive always felt that bayern are losing their potential with tuchel even a hansi flick return is favourable
the huge loss aside that kimmich goal was out of the top draw 
i know itll have made harry kane feel at home but bayern looked a bit spursy there
the fact that a german 3rd division team saarbrcken beat bayern and frankfurt at the dfb pokal is way more shocking 
that second goal tho 
you would think that after 123 years of playing this game they would know that as well as knowing how to attack you also have to know when and how to defend
for years that bayern defense has been no where near good enough and the only manager recently that has really got away with it was flick
that was simply awful and a bad bad loss
the opportunity was lost to go top and play many more game like that and we might as well kiss the bundesliga and the cl goodbye i would also like to know what tuchel has against thomas muller
he really should be playing a lot more
on a footnote upamecano has to go he really is not learning
i want alonsos leverkusen to be the team to finally dethrone bayern munich but was not expecting this 1st defeat in league
before you haters start saying that kane has cursed bayern its not kanes fault this happened it was tuchels horrific tactics that caused this to happen bayern had these problems last season and kane wasnt even at the club kane has been made as a scapegoat for bayerns problems tuchel has clearly ruined bayern
united losing 30 at home to bournemouth now bayern losing 51  great way to head into their big clash in ucl midweek
kane not winning a trophy at bayern would be cruel but also beautiful poetry
can you imagine if the first season kane comes and scores loads of goals bayern dont win anything 
brilliant and hilarious its about time that bayern were brought down to earth 
frankfurt were unstoppable 
51 against frankfurt got kovac sacked shame this 51 wont get tuchel sacked i hate the way we fired nagelsmann and i really didnt want tuchel hes turned the team into a mess and the matches arent pretty to watch id like to think hed get sacked before the end of the season but i feel like getting knocked out of the cl and leverkusen winning the bundesliga is the only thing thatll get him sacked after we embarrassed ourselves sacking nagelsmann only to get knocked out of the cl and nearly lose the bundesliga under you guessed it tuchel
woah bayerns first loss of the season and its a heavy one the forwards seemed frustrated and clumsy
this happens in football frankfurt are a decent team especially on the break i think the key for bayern is to get the first goal in matches be patient no way leverkusen will keep it going

us vs uk christmas special 2023  food wars  insider food",232,"love watching these christmas specials every year thanks guys
4347 this is true theres plenty of historical evidence such as recipes from tudor courts like henry viiis and from mentions in food available at places like shakespeares globe theatre that mince pies did originally have minced beef still spiced with christmas spices like cinnamon nutmeg and cloves the fruit only versions were much later to coincide with sweet food desires of the georgian 1700s period and as a way for the wealthy to show off that they could afford expensive fresh fruit to go into pies rather than mince which is made from the cheapest cuts of meat which over time became cheaper to be made

back in the days of the original mince pie though the pastry wasnt as sweet or crumbly and would instead have been more like the hard pastry of a melton mowbray style pork pie
thanks for doing these specials every christmas guys  really enjoy them
yay ive been waiting for this special since last years edition amazing hosts and fun show to watch
my takeaways on the starbucks section as a us starbucks barista 1 glad to have gingerbread lattes back didnt have them for 3 years but still salty that the uk has eggnog and we dont 2 surprised gingerbread loaf and snowman cookies are only available in some regions of the us i have them in my store in the san francisco bay area and 3 bring back south pole sam and north pole nat starbucks uk why you gotta do harry dirty like that 
this was quite the wholesome episode 
4338 it is made with mincemeat but it is not made with minced meat

mincemeat just like its cousin sweetmeat uses a much earlier definition of meat that simply meant food in general rather than specifically animalbased food its only now the original secondary definition of meat has become the dominant one that mincemeat and sweetmeat seem like misnomers but theyre really not theyre simply using an earlier definition of the word meat that no longer really survives outside of those two specific cases
fun exclusive holiday fact the elf krispy kreme in the uk actually have an exclusive christmas tree donut that we dont have in our us elf donuts
i see joe has a similar opinion to me with reecesany shaped reeces taste horrible but i love the regular ones
nico should try the regular nutty buddy it is covered in chocolate they taste loads better than the shaped reeces i like butterfinger but they are difficult for me to eat these daysi would much prefer a nutty buddy over the butterfinger
this continues to be an excellent series however its a shame when some things arent tried by the presenters one of the key selling points of food wars is watching the hosts put their body through real torture in the name of telling us how things taste 
good episode  had popeye for first time cple weeks ago liked it  even had an american buscuit with cajun gravy  im a big fan of america biscuits and there other alter ego as scones   i see dominos do a turkkey pizza but had pizza xpress xmas pizza cple awhile ago and that blew me away how nice it is but as im having pheasant breast for xmas with bread sauce and all trimings i guess expecting pheasantr burger out of question can u clarify eggnog latte i couldnt find it advertised so bought own syrup and my friend whose a barrista in indianna srabucks said its off menu in usa
after eight mints were a staple of the holidays at my house it was a treat when my mom would pick some up at random times of the year too
the starbucks gingerbread got chai is indeed really good the only other thing ive tried in this video is the cranberry sprite and its very mediocre its more sour apple flavored than cranberry flavored to me
uk here and my family usually have a baked camembert for a starter before xmas dinner i dunno how widespread that tradition is but mcdonalds picking camembert as the xmas cheese makes sense to me
these christmas episodes are always good insider food 
a 45 minute episode we are in for a treat guys
happy holidays and merry christmas to the entire food wars team and community
the us really loves dishing out a plethora of holiday sugarpacked treats nice combo to have joe nico and harry    
love the addition of nico to this episode shes so fun 3

doctorwho 60thanniversary thegiggle review",2522,"i think people are missing the main take away here when the bigeneration happened 14s clothing was divided between them and 15 got the underwear so 14 spent that entire time commando
i dont mind the bigeneration i instantly assumed the 14th would become the curator  the 50th special introduced him and was stated he was the doctor who retired and now the 60th showed his origin to me the doctor  wouldnt willing retire knowing there were people out there that needed help  but now with the bigeneration 14th can retire and become the curator and live a peaceful for the doctor life and the 15th doctor can continue saving the universe
i love the idea that biregeneration was a myth meaning that tennants salt at the end of the universe also made the myth come into being
from 1966 and tom campbell in dalek invasion earth to 2023 and wilfred mott bernard cribins deserves his eternal recognition in dr who history
for me it wasnt the mention of river song that buckled my knees it was them finally acknowledging that sarah jane is gone
also how lovely that donnas story comes full circle following on from her advice to the doctor at the end of the runaway bride sometimes you need somebody to stop you shes the person who gets him to stop running and build a found family on earth
so excited for the ncuti era
i liked how it paid off tennants seemingly bitter frustration in his first regeneration he wasnt ready to go and wanted to do so much more this time he was ready to let go and move on but kinda poetically he was allowed to have his happy ending after saving the world
this episode had a horror element a sci fi element a history element a cosmic wonder element an interpersonal familial element this episode had everything dr who has been known for
theres a brief line where ncuti tells tennant that hes whole and healthy because tennant took the time to get whole and healthy time lords doing therapy out of order makes me think that when tennant dies his regeneration will pull him out of spacetime and drop him in his past back at the 60th anniversary to the moment ncuti appeared its not that there are 2 doctors nowtechnically as a time traveler all his incarnations are around at all times its that the regeneration happened out of order personally i like this
the best two of three really takes a double meaning with the two doctors beating the toy maker
thank you for touching on the absolute bs we ambulatory we use that word vs full time users confined is generally outdated wheelchair users get from ignorant people shirley is a great character definitely deserved her up also love kate and the scene between them was well done 
this was the best episode in a long long time neil patrick harris was just outstanding in his role and it felt like everyone else upped their game accordingly ncuti gatwa also did a great job i felt like he just slipped straight into the role heres hoping he gets some great stories and writing that he can make the most of
can i just say what a joy ncuti gatwa is i am always reticent about the new doctor but he won me over the second he took tennant in his arms and said i got you i was like yes hes the doctor he is someone who just lights up a room capaldi will always be my 1 smith to date is 2 but i am looking forward to what ncuti will offer us im excited to see where we go from here bravo rtd you won me back from when i walked away i thought permanently till now from the dregs of the chibnal era
loved the episode and i feel that the bigeneration was made possible by the toy maker bringing his rules to our universe also to me  ncuti gatwa instantly felt like the doctor like when matt smith started no need to get a couple of episodes to feel it with the others
the giggle was perfect this was truly the first of these specials that felt like a celebration of 60 years of doctor who i loved the framing device of john logie baird and the invention of television really reminded me of that episode from series 2 about queen elizabeth iis coronation it had all these great callbacks and mentions to so many characters most if not all of whom are no longer accessible to the doctor like amy and rose tyler is it wishful thinking to hope that no mention of martha means freema agyeman will pop up again soon even though its very clear that she wasnt mentioned because she lived a happy life and their story didnt end tragically neil patrick harris was fantastic i loved the switching of accents evil camp is always fun especially when its as sinister as this was and the spice up your life dance sequence i still have no idea what the hell bigeneration means i mean we heard from all the doctors previously in the reboot that regeneration was super dodgy but making a whole new one is not a twist i was expecting but this establishes that in a oneononehundredmillionbillionbillion chance time lords can reproduce asexually however how many times can the doctor make a copy of themselves the end fight with the toymaker had the frenetic pace of tens fight with the sycorax way back in 2006 i loved ncutis energy he really felt like a showman much more than the other doctors previously and because they said he processed his trauma fifteen seems like hes going to be a doctor who is having fun and not haunted by his dark deeds or running from something which is a doctor rtd never gave himself the chance to write its like  fourteen was supposed to go on this journey of trauma healing and at the end regenerate into the happy and fun fifteen but the toymaker got in the way and it looks like we have another rtd mystery box on our hand with the meeps boss still left unanswered and now the toymakers the one who waits lets face it its probably the meeps boss i love that fourteens costume got split between the two so fifteen spends the entire episode in underwear but because he got the shows not only does fourteen speed the entire 3rd act barefoot and commando which is hilarious in and of itself fifteen feels even more naked donnas do you come in a range of colors is perfect because it addresses ncutis blackness without making it a big deal because its not i love that they let ncuti keep his true accent  i love that we didnt have to say goodbye to tennant again not really that scene of him having lunch with donnas family really his family was just perfect and im happy that his last words are technically ive never been so happy in my life you can really hear tennants scottish accent on wheelchair accessible it really feels like they are setting up a unit spinoff and i am here for it i need it to be kate shirley mel and the vlinx whatever the hell that is and maybe osgood fingers crossed

the doctors bigeneration means that if michael sheen ever played the doctor hopefully as sixteen then sheen and tennant as fourteen can share the screen
i loved this episode the doctor has seen and felt so much pain and loss and has himself lost so much and hes been running from that pain for so long the doctor deserves a rest and deserves happiness and now he finally gets it while 14 gets to rest and heal 15 will be carrying on the job of protecting the universe i know ive seen complaints about the biregeneration and complaints that ncutis 15 didnt get to properly shine by having an episode to himself when he debuted but i disagree i think he shined mightily the impression i got is that when he separated from tennants 14 15 left behind much of that guilt and pain effectively unburdening the doctor of much of his trauma while 14 will go about healing from it all and get to enjoy life with people he cares about and who care about him in this way both doctors get to recover and live happier lives if my interpretation is correct that means the new series of doctor who will see a happier more playful doctor which i think is a wonderful new direction for the show it now makes sense that they are referring to the time of the 15th doctor as seriesseason 1 of doctor who because we are getting in effect a brand new doctor in more ways than one not just a new face but a revitalized renewed doctor i cry tears of joy knowing that the doctor is getting a much deserved rest and reward while simultaneously going forward as a happier healthier person it is truly the best of both worlds for the doctor and i look forward to watching the christmas special and the new series as well as whatever spinoffs they produce especially if that means we get both donna and 14 together as well as the adventures of 15 but even if we never get to see donna and 14 again im happy knowing that he is happy and look forward to the adventures of 15 with bated breath at least in regards to doctor who we are living on the best of timelines now if only the rest of the world would follow suit thank you david tennant and catherine tate for your return for these specials and a hearty welcome to ncuti gatwa as the 15th doctor and a thank you also to the rest of the cast of the giggle thank you sean for the ups  downs as well as the rest of the whoculture crew who worked on this bernard cribbins we miss you and love you live long and prosper and allonsy
as a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy the ramp now being on the tardis and all the inclusion in all of the specials just makes my heart so full i can now truly feel feel like im a part of one of my favorite franchises the new cannon will take some getting used to but i really like what what happened here because i think the idea of all the doctors getting a happy ending instead of a sad one is really brilliant and open the door to make multi doctor stories make a lot more sense ie it fully explains tales of tardis for example neil was just amazing as the toymaker
this episode was great i agree that this was the role that neal patrick harris was born to play ncuti already has shown he can hold his own against tennant and i cant wait to see to how his team as the doctor goes im excited catherine and david are so good together i will miss them but i also love that there is a way for them to come back im also excited for the rest of the toymakers legion the return of the master and the mysterious female hand that got the tooth i also think thanks to bigeneration this is how the doctor or a version of the doctor will now become the curator by who knows taps noses

theme music vespers by topher mohr and alex alena from the youtube music library
lovely to hear those tones of outraged relish as you relate the numerous fixes she needs and to see as well as hear your unalloyed joy that twiggys there for you your happiness makes us happy thanks for sharing it
what a lovely tour of your new spidercraft er i mean runabout  d  shes very pretty and quirky  thanks for the indepth look  i can see why you fell in love with twiggy
david with a twinkle in his eye talking about repairing a boat the order of life is restored
love your new adventure
imagine taking this little boat out across the wash like you did a narrow boat once now that would be an adventure 
i just love your new boat and so happy that youre enjoying the canals again
if you are going to be doing any fiber glassing you could raise the level of that area in front of the outboard by a 14 inch or so to make the water funnel out the drain hole better
you are the master of telling the way it is in such a uplifting and inspiring way thanks for the promised tour i could not help smiling carefully 
thanks for the tour of the boat david  im so glad that youre back on the water and i look forward to more canal stories and updates on your improvements to  the boat  thanks for sharing  keep the videos coming and safe travels 
david you are absolutely correct it is a fun little boat it definitely has lots of potential and with the tlc  you are willing to give it it will provide years of pleasurable boating no doubt when you have completed most of the fixes youll be grinning inwardly on the canals as you skim past all those naysayers cheers for now
i suggest you put the solar panel over the engine aft and hinge it so it can fold down or angle towards the sun that would free up the hatch
a bit rough around the edges but twiggy is full of potential 
obviously youre going to relocate the electrics under the hob and fit a water tank under the sink  as for matching the color after repairs i wouldnt sweat that and just have the entire boat repainted which would cover a multitude of sins enough advice you enjoy a challenge and youre quite good at fashioning solutions so have at it and enjoy your new boat
thanks david for your tour of twiggy no repairs you cant handle and it will be fun as always watching you fix it up and make it your own thanks again and keep smiling
davids trying his best to play the curmudgeon while pointing out all the things that need fixing but we all know that inside hes rubbing his hands together excitedly in anticipation of all the diy projects he gets to enjoy in bringing twiggy up to ctc standards  just as were all rubbing our hands together excitedly in anticipation of all the videos hes going to make while engaging in said diy projects  

youve got a great boat with a lot of potential and were looking forward to seeing your progress  thanks for sharing
the thing i like about this boat is that while it is certainly a project it is also perfectly functional  plenty of stuff that needs doing but on days when you dont feel like doing you can just go happily mess about in your boat thank you for the lovely tour

on a side note it is rather nice to occasionally see other people asking but why when theyre working on something old  ive been working on my old farmhouse for a number of years and i still come across things that make me wonder what the previous owners were thinking
buy a water bladder for the water supply  it will conform to the space that you have available and you can fill it with a hose from a dockside tap  if you relocate the battery bank to the opposite side they should counter balance one another
hi david  it is very good to see you back on the water  a place you are meant to be  especially with a boat needing quite a bit of handymanning  we always enjoy your videos showing how you overcome all problems with a bit of thought a few materials and stuff you buy from amazon  its diy as an art form  that combined with your excellent storytelling great use of video and deadpan humour makes our day  thank you
im trying to image the proud owners on their first day taking delivery of this little vessel and what an exciting time it would have been

jaidenanimations storytime birds",24080,"congratulations jaiden on having grandchildren 
the fortune tellers saying jaiden would have 3 kids is suddenly making a lot more sense
good job ari and tofu woooo lets goooo
check out the scribble after dark tour grab tickets here  httpscribbleshowdowncom
i cant believe we witnessed jaiden growing up so fast first a college student now a grandmother
if you want to keep the eggs and want to move them out of the freezer you can also encase them in resin as a memento of her laying eggs without running the risk of accidentally breaking them in the freezer or having them explode cause normal eggs can explode in the freezer and idk if it would be harder or easier to explode tiny eggs like that
if you go back and watch aris first birthday theres a great segment that goes along the lines of  i dont know aris gender the only way to really know is a dna test unless its too late and you already have eggs everywhere
for anyone wondering there are two types of birds nesting and nonnesting a nesting birds babies are called nestlings and when first hatched are super fragile needs constant food cannot walk or fly is completely featherless and takes longer to mature a nonnesting birds babies are just called chicks and when first hatched can walk dont need constant food cannot fly and has a fuzzy coat that keeps them warm independantly of their mother

chickens turkeys quail pheasants ducks geese etc all give birth to chicks which is why you may be thinking that baby birds are easy to care for they kinda just figure out life on their own nestling birds need special equipment foods and sometimes medicines to be raised by humans you need to feed them every 46 hours with a syringe keep them warm and keep them hydrated which is harder to do when they are kept warm for the duration of their infancy you basically have to nap instead of sleep or have a second person assist you as you both plan your sleep schedules to do a 1212 shift you need to take care of them for something or rather every 3 hours on the hour raising a bird seems really cool but dont raise a nestling unless you know everything about the species you are trying to raise
tip if you want to know if the eggs are fertilized or not just put a flashlight over them and look if there is any red spots over the yellow gold
jaiden i hope they get along
the birds bubble gum electric
as a female cockatiel owner egg binding is a scary concept ive been told calcium supplements and a vet visit to remove any stuck eggs is fine but still so sols cage has no possible nesting spots and when shes out of it shes always with me so its all good  

sol is such a personable sweetheart i adore her she demands head scritches from everyone including the vet lol and hates hates hates raisins like will literally throw them out of her feed hates them learned that the first time when i was hand feeding her bits of her feed and she bounced it off my knee xd

as for the sawdust comment i can 100 believe that sol had a toy meant for the parakeets my twin and i used to have before they passed but never ended up giving it to and she adored it she cronched that thing like cookie wafer  sounded like it too anyway the moment it stopped being an out of cage toy and i hung it up inside said cage it got absolutely demolished very quickly and there was just woodchips everywhere so many woodchips i swear the thing should not have produced that many but it did

i adore birds theyre my favorite kind of pet but i am very consciously aware that a cockatiel is my best match and not say a conure or heaven forbid an actual parrot and thats okay also jaiden is 110 correct raising baby birds is a nightmare i wouldve done the same thing as would many other bird owners google it if you dont believe us back on topic though while in my opinion birds make for the best kind of pet you need to take into account whether or not you are able to give them the time and attention they need know what you can and cannot do and if you cant thats okay know your limits but dont get a bird if you cant take care of it properly itll just end in tears 

so to sum it up egg binding is scary sol is the best sorry not sorry ari and tofu bird sawdust is real raising baby birds is a nightmare and birds make for the best pets if and only if youre able to meet their needs and theres nothing wrong with you if you cant just dont get a bird if so
pray for jaden that she doesnt lose her mind from taking care of lots of birds
as an er vet who sees birds i agree with 100 of your sentiments about bird ownership at the end loved the video very humorous but also spreading the truth about bird ownership
my friend had three parakeets in the past the mother died naturally and then the daughter unalived her father glad to see tofu and ari are well 
i love jaidens pet videos about her feathered babies hopefully she makes one for tostada the kitty cat one day too
015 i just wanna mention how nice this depiction of this fanbase is all just calmly cheering for ari i love this depiction because fans of any media these days sometimes are portrayed as rabidly obsessed creatures with no sense of reason and it hurts when youre part of that fanbase it really shows the maturity of her team and of jaidens fans i commend you all this really is such a lovely mature and respectful community
as a long time fan this is crazy to watch never would i have thought ari would become a dad or a mom
as a cat owner of the most gremlin crazy cats i laughed so hard at this video pet owners of the pets who destroy things but who you love dearly truly understand where youre coming from 
as a green cheek conure owner piccolo and bansuri are some of the best things that ever happened to me i regret nothing and simultaneously theyre the bane of my existence

i honestly didnt realize just how dumb water witches looked until this video i didnt realize it was so blatantly made up
great video  the hotel is  looking really good  the water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist
its crazy to watch how much progress youve made since 2020 the town looks great
we love your videos brent they dont all have to be well planned like they all are you could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same thanks for being a content creator
im not an expert hiker or trail blazer but i think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail  it would be safer for anyone that wants to see that beautiful view of the valley  keep up the fantastic work brent  im hoping to be able to get to cerro gordo within the next couple of years  till then i look forward to more and more video updates
brent you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees leaving stone cairns on a route for others to follow looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in oz happy festive season mate
theres nothing i want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
theres something magical about the sierras i was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at lake sabrina you can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning the calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless
yes dan is awesome love his channel so glad hes made an appearance
bravo brent  im so proud to have watched your first episodes of ghost town living way back in 2020  i never stopped  best channel on you tube  it never gets old  thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride  i will get to cerro gordo one day and visit  congratulations on a great month and merry christmas
hey brent what you are doing at cerro gordo is just simply amazing i am  a retired water treatment production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and i am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history  thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos i am envious of your accomplishments
cerro gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately but id love to visit if i had the chance your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from its amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on
ive been watching since before the hotel burnt down and im so glad that its being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
brent your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch i never miss an episode i would love to visit one day i am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun  maybe one day i could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully i can visit in the near future cheers

i think hiking trails are a great idea that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too especially once you get a good supply of water on tap then the town could serve as a base camp so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies

i made this an in depth as possible to answer all of your questions hopefully i got them all which hero equipment will you be using for your strategy 

town hall 16 playlist httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistpletramf0nlxuvjlriv36ycaqna4vjyztm
heres the thing the new wall levels take 9m for a single piece but there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls 4 which can shoot over walls there is a jump and an earthquake spell 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
i actually like this change because for me the archer queens spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible
im a little concerned about the epic equipment especially if its tied to events it kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available
im suspicious of the epic equipment if they are only available from special events and much better than regular equipment theres potential balance issues
243 those ore numbers are spectacular
clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes thank you judo for always keeping us updated with juicy coc contents 
i think this is really cool but i am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level i really hope that levelling up your gear doesnt take ages and ages 

additionally i am very afraid of having epic gear thats limited i really hope that isnt something thats done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get anything limited atm is purely aesthetic and doesnt impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else i hope they keep that in mind
i hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking so you could startegize even further
for me this is just an amazing feature and something i would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops by that knowledge i think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that
the vampire mustache rage crystal and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if dps gets too high cant wait to try it out
great stuff as ever will you be doing an upgrade priority guide i know with most new th levels its the usual routine of th lab cc storages army camps etc but this feels very different and exciting eg with the blacksmith would love some guidance
i really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately for instance using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
its nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th1615 changes
thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation thanks
with the epic equipment for events as long as it doesnt require money to get i think will be such a good idea make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
this is so awesome its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new contentthese are gonna change the game a lot and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears

manunited manchesterunited mufc",2747,"the pain in his eyes youre not alone brother
the worst thing is this isnt rock bottom yet bayern and the scoucers to come heads will roll this week
im 80 years old  1st match at old trafford in 1955  my club is unrecognizable  im with andy 100  the glazers have wrecked this club not just the infrastructure but the whole ethos  unconscionable  we have had difficult times with our  teams over the years but the glazers are not just wrecking the team they are dismantling the club
this guy is the real man working class top englishman lives for his family the way he speaks about his family the way he loves this club we all live and breath united these players are a disgrace they dont represent anything we belive in just want to live another league title with my dad but these players are not gonna give us that
i feel sorry for andy but know exactly how he feels im 74 and seen a lot of ups and downs at united these last 60 plus years you will bounce back andy and support your team irrespective of the shocking standards that some of these players are displaying have a great christmas my friend and we will smile again i promise you
im a liverpool fan but always enjoyed andys passion  im really sorry for him tonight  hope he bounces back  we all have these days but we are all supportive of each other regardless of the team 
unlike a lot of fans that appear on fan tv channels andy tate is a real one wears his heart on his sleeve loves his football callstells it as he sees it a proper football fan that is purely on here to share his thoughts and opinion not on for the views or popularity a man that looks like his club has finally broken him enjoy your christmas lad
this is deep i swear i felt pain listening to andy tate pour out his emotions like we all feel ten hag might not survive christmas
he spoke nothing but what every man united feels right now big up andy
heartbreaking to see andy yesterday  i understand him united is our life been a united supporter for over 50 years since i was a kid uniteds dreams has always been our dreams  its so hard to grasp  that we have come to this 70s was not all joy but i never doubted sammy bryan greenhoff brothers big gordon rip etcthey were all my heroes  
this is not the manchester united i used to know i really feel for andy tate i can see that hes close to tears and this shows how much he loves united i personally have been supporting manchester united for well over two decades this result ranks among the very worst i have seen so far this should not be happening anywhere united plays not to talk of this disaster happening at old trafford the glazers have done so much damage to the club i am sad at what i am witnessing very horrible time to be a manchester united supporter
why hasnt anyone said how well bournemouth defended players sliding into stopping every ball masterclass
we were in their face up front but had no chance because of this
newcastle fan here but this is the best fan reactions i have ever see passion and you can see the absolute devastation in his eyes the start of the video was just
im a blue and im not going to lie andy tate was always a figure of fun to me however i genuinely feel his pain here all rivalries aside the hardcore manc reds deserve better than the tripe this lot are serving up
happy birthday for this week andy
i honestly think its the training its like the players are all questioning or second guessing every single thing they do in a game like onana who spends a good 1015 minutes per game passing the ball around the back 4 to showprove hes good with his feet like scott who somehow cant pass a ball 6 yards i mean  look at these same players playing for their countries  for example bruno and dalot are excellent for portugal and they come back and theyre suddenly crap i think this is on the manager unfortunately ten hag could have cantona schmeichel giggs cole robson keane vidic stam etc and i think wed see the same i know the wide players frustrate us sometimes but it feels like he gives them free rein and end up looking shite because no one else is running afraid to get the ball and make a mistake same with bruno too i think the back line  i think maguire is suddenly looking good again because hes chosen to go back to basics its probably time the manager goes at least he brought with him martinez so its not all been bad
i saw how emotional you were after the match andywas sitting in front of you never saw someone so upset and could see your hurtknocked me a bit to see ya that upsetwas with my 9 year old son for the first time from ireland and was emotional myself for him that thats his first match he had to witness could feel the emotion of people and just the tiredness of everything from the fans
i agree with everything you have said im 72 years of age followed mu since i was 8 years old spent many thousands of dollars travelling to old trafford to watch them play from australia i was at last years liverpool game coming away so so disappointed i told my son after that game until they change the manager and players ill never go to another united game travelling to london next march and ill go see tottenham play city at least ill see an exciting match and players that give supporters what they pay for professional attitude quality team spirit and managers that knows what theyre doing
i think the lack of swearing but the heartfelt words make this all the more meaningful he absolutely echoes what we all feel  we are all sick and tired of it  and all we want at this stage is good honest  hardworking performances
not a united fan but i have to say that its sad to see the club where they are today i hope that they can turn things around their fans deserve better ynwa

the little one dragging the bucket was so relieved and definitely seemed to understand he needed help and excepted it graciously
        
               
no way the pup dragging that bucket behind him would have had a chance to survive in the water thanks ocnteam for saving these two pups lives
1 seal didnt have much time left and what a horrible mess it had to deal with 2 was another one of those ball lines that also would have lead to its demise the way it was wrapped around the body thank you ocn for saving these babies and talking to them in a way to help calm them down is always so cute 
as someone with asthma i know what the seals feel when they are able to breathe freely  thank you for yalls unswerving efforts to helping seals and other wildlife have a wonderful and safe healthy holiday season 
thank you for the work you do  its interesting and helps to inform the public what these animals go through just to survive

thank you to the entire ocn team for everything you do to release the seals from those dangerous entanglements
well done two more little lives saved 
the things those little guys pickup  its a miracle they make it out of the water strong to be pulling a bucket around thank you for saving them
ive been watching these heroes of the sea life for years and keep wondering when they will give up on the endless need for saving seals from ghost gear entanglements but they persist with skill and empathy week after week year after year so grateful
congratulations on yet another amazing job   your doing work that should be paid for by the fishing industry

i watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
love how olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance  that applause was richly deserved
guts was such a masterpiece i cant wait for next album she literally never misses
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances 
this video demonstrates her creative ability so well and how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass 
being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire olivia never ceases to amaze me 
her breaking the glass part before the chorus is fabulous 
also the scream part is wow  her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
this is exactly what i would imagine an official mv for this song would be like and the fact that she performed it live just perfecf 
ok this performance was a moment also love how she didnt break character once the song was over and was getting applause she stood in that attitude  tongue out cake on the face those eyes glaring at you the intensity so perfect
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 
i love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile were happy and cheerful on the outside and i love the scream so much  thanks olivia 
this performance is insane olivia is such a hard worker her voice her emotions the way she looks is perfect im so grateful i am a teenage girl because of olivia
shes not just another pop queen  besides pop her music has some angst and an edge to it which is awesome  this performance was fantastic
this is one of olivias best performances i love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills so proud to see her evolving in live performances
olivia entregando talento como sempre
being a fan since sourthis album blown away my expectations and the performance are just brilliant im a metal and rock listener and olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music hope to see a show of her someday great work
meu deus que performance ela quebrando a taa na virada da msica ficou incrvel
im so proud of her and her improvement in performance watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too 

im glad im going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music she saved me when the sour album dropped it meant a lot to me at that time im in my lowest point sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand i was 16 in my room all day and night because of tracks on sour i can accept my jealousy towards other girls i can relieve my anger towards my exboyfriend some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations like his new girlfriends name sounds so much like mine just slightly different

im 18 now i was so much happier than that time i moved on i forgive and forget i have a lot of new friends and good memories i got into a university and my studying great just like she said shes so much happier than the time when she wrote sour im so happy for her and myself 

hope she can do tour in my country
please come to asia thank u

demonslayer kimetsunoyaiba anime",2736,"this arc will be the calm before the storm
this arc is pretty cool but manga readers all know how legendary the next will be
edit i think there will be one more arc after the next or maybe just one big arc smushed together after this one
this is it guys where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc get yourself ready for whats coming next
this season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all 
im so excited for the hashira training arc  it really is the definition of calm before the storm
hell yeah manga readers all know whats going to come next the calm before the storm 
i can definitely see a lot of people not going like this arc due to the fact that it doesnt really have any great fighting sequence but i dont care the fact that this arc is the prime setup of one the greatest arcs in the entire series sends me shivers truly one of the calm before the storm moments

and for any manga readers reading this you know damn well that they are going to give us one of the biggest cliffhangers in the series if you know what i mean
demon slayer is absolutely a phenomenon to experience its been almost 5 years since the anime debuted and now after the the hashira training arc well be officially 1 arc away depending on how they animate the final one from completing the anime i remember watching the first episode only a few days after its release like it was just yesterday i never imagined it would become this big i cant wait to experience all of what kny has before it ends 
happy to see all the hashira in one frame 2025 to infinity arc
its crazy how big and popular demon slayer got in such a short amount of time
hyped for the new season
for manga readers out there what im most excited for is when mitsuri is gonna explain how she got the mark i love that scene and cant wait to see the other hashiras backstory animated
a final happiness for us ds fans coz people are not ready for the next infinity castle arc its really gonna break the internet 
i absolutely can not wait to see the arc after this get animated it will be a legendary arc and i get chills thinking about it

GB,QEt36u4KJuk,chris harris on the 1990 williamsrenault fw13b formula one car  hungarian grand prix winner,collecting cars,2023-12-10T14:00:10Z,,93629,3712,"this is one for all you f1 fans out there as an introduction for its arrival on private sales by collecting cars chris harris dives into the archives with former head of williams heritage jonathan williams to discuss the history of the grand prix winning 1990 williamsrenault fw13b formula 1 car 

this car is now available on private sales by collecting cars httpscollectingcarscomforsale1990williamsrenaultfw13b

with a striking design that any aesthete can appreciate the fw1313b model is a particularly notable racer from williams history claiming three grand prix wins across the 1989 and 1990 seasons that achievement is all the more impressive considering the dominance of senna and prost over those two years between them winning 21 of the 32 races

chassis fw13b08 is arguably the most impressive of all securing not only pole position in qualifying but taking its driver to outright victory at the hungaroring in 1990 leading from start to finish

finding a car that has spent 25 years in its teams private collection is unusual but another factor that makes this chassis especially rare is that it retains the original renault rs2 35litre v10 most of these powertrains were scrapped in period so it is remarkable to find a car still running its correct and fully functional works engine

chrisharris williams formula1 f1 renault racecar collectingcars thierryboutsen",214,"this is the sort of content the cosmos wants you to produce rather than the top gear centrist stuff  thank you  i hope you enjoy doing what you were destined for  i absolutely love it
collecting cars is allowing chris to grow and develop
the amount of knowledge mr jonathan williams has is mindblowing
some people still dont realise just how good nigel mansell was one of the best f1 drivers ever
chris harris on race car history 
what a treat it would be to have a series of hour long programs with jonathan williams talking about each fw car from the 90s
please do more racing stories like this we need more historical looks into racing than the oversubscribed world of super cars well never have great work
the thing about that mansell story that went untold  the first time nigel got in the car and went around the track he immediately came into the pits and said go to the truck and get me the softest springs youve got after they were fitted nige went two seconds quicker than the car had ever gone around that circuit thats why patrick felt theyd wasted 1990  theyd at boutsens behest gone completely in the wrong direction in terms of car setup
this era of f1 was sadly before my time but thank you for this conversation as i learnt so much
fantastic content and production and where has jonathan williams been hiding   love to hear more from him
brilliant just bloody brilliant great car with that amazing documented history chris can we please have an extended interview with jonathon williams
that was the pinnacle of the sport 35 v10 manual the sound and visual drama driver skills were paramount very unlike contemporary equipment which has more resemblance to playstation than exciting racing pitcrew in shorts and no helmets is just a sight to behold 
i think i could listen to jonathan williams and chris harris talk about formula 1 for a week and still not be bored stellar work
the best era in f1 in my opinion late 1980s to midlate 1990s  that howling exotic sound and titanium sparks flying out the back  i cant even care about the modern formula 1 since they went v6 turbo 
what a machine i was 13 when this car was winning races remember watching those races with my dear old dad thanks for bringing back those memories miss you dad peace
highly emotional having been the avid f1 follower on tv in those days this somehow feels like a part of my own history
thanks to all involved in this production
i feel this video was made specifically for me its 100 right up my alley the subject matter the time period and the content perfection
wow that didnt feel like 17 minutes i legitimately got goose bumps when the book was shown with the run sheets incredible stuff please chris more of this
that was one of the best videosinterviews ive seen for a while what a knowledge and memory jonathan has

last summer i visited and spent the afternoon inside the fascinating london library it happened by chance and i wasnt aware that bram stoker had visited the same library wow after wasting most of my morning inside the cyprus consulate which is also in st james square i was drawn to the library once i spotted it and i felt compelled to pop inside to have a look i was very pleased that i had because the london library is indeed a very fascinating place

as always  brilliant episode
the assistants at all those shops were marvellous  friendly warm knowledgeable and welcoming great advertisements for their businesses
also great reference to the pogues  rip shane
when i visited picadilly circus  the strand i was overwhelmed by the inmense history and rich culture that this part of london contained excellent as always jooz guides 
i spent most of 1975 working in the staff canteen of the piccadilly hotel two floors beneath street level this 21 year old canadian saw both sides of london shades of orwells down and out in i roamed every street you showed loved every minute spent there thank you for reviving grest memories
what a great tour so many wonderful historic shops thank you
i appreciate and have a lot of respect for you with the way that you not only will show and talk about businesses in the areas you are touring but also will go inside and give the ownersemployees a chance to tell us about the place in their own words give some history about it and promote the local businesses to make the people watching your videos interested in going there and supporting them even though its also a way for you to get more information and content in your video to make it longer add some interest and have more accurate descriptions of the places and what they do it really is a class act for you to do that simple gesture especially when they arent paying you to come there and include them in your videos
its also kind of funny that the two girls  were taking a picture of themselves under the underground sign while touring the city and they were mere feet away from the greatest tour guide they could hope for to show them around give them the history of the city tell them not only facts about it but also some things that may or may not be facts but should be lol
thank you for sending me your signed book with devotion so rapidly dear julian i was lucky to have noticed your announcement about the signing event in november and made use of it it was delivered very quickly to germany i have already my favourite routes in your book and will be happy to walk them through when i will be next time in london i also rewatched the episode with the favourite places of your mum and was delighted by her fine taste i noticed that it would be an ideal day for me if i spent it just like in that episode every site was a pearl  and ended in victoriaalbert museum magnificent and may this educated and kind hearted woman rest in peace
absolutely scintillating my favorite area of london and my favorite joolz guide so far stacked with information too bravo 
a cup of earl grey and a tour of piccadilly with joolz the perfect way to end sunday thank you so much
this was a great walk and so interesting  too bad tower records closed but if im not mistaken they still have a store in japan  there are plenty of record stores in london maybe you could do a tour of thoseyour channel is great for those of us that dont get to travel thanks joolz and simon
i do love these videos a stressful period yet im sitting here watching with interest and then realise that im smiling away oh and the book is brill 
another great film always good to hear tom singing too spotted the cyprus flag  my adopted home country piccadilly just isnt the same any more just glad there are still many old parts of london with lots of history for you to tell us about plenty to fill many books i am sure

now he knows what its like to play the chiefs 
the call was 100 correct chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
for those who didnt watch snf tonight

this penalty was called once in 2021 twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season 

so it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials and the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasnt some conspiracy 

mahomes reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled
there has been a lot of bad officiating this season 

this was an example of good officiating
hes looking at the baaaaaaaall  and still line up off sidewow
chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldnt happen at such an important point of the game  we should go back and see what the eagles think about the holding call in the super bowl last year chiefs werent complaining then
never understood why any player whatever the position would line up offside  these guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do  you dont even have to move your bod just use a couple of neck muscles turn your head and look  unbelievable
because the chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him the bills won this game and they dont even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral 
still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
if youre lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next to you to see the ball  youre offsides  how did toney not realize the ball and center was behind him
doesnt matter how many times it was called before you know the rules offsides is offsides end of story he could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches he knew the game was at stake and if he didnt know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known
he was looking right at the ball how could he not know to move back thats on him
whats shocking is that toney didnt drop the lateral from kelce
all penalties aside that was a sweet lateral
ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
as a broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
it does look like offsides but what a cool play the chiefs are an amazing team
geez that was a great throw a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting td would have been fun in highlight reels kelce probably cant reenact that lastsecond pass what a shame",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S,"['congratulation bill you beat the chief and made them cry win for all football fan', 'now know what like play the chief', 'the call 100 correct chief have one blame but themselves', 'for those who did not_ watch snf tonight', '', 'this penalty called once 2021 twice last year and time coming into the game this season', '', 'obviously point emphasis for official and the flag thrown immediately upon the snap not_ some conspiracy', '', 'mahomes reaction really rubbing wrong and come off spoiled', 'there been lot bad officiating this season', '', 'this example good officiating', 'looking the baaaaaaaall and still line off sidewow', 'chief are arguing that such ticky tack call should not_ happen such important point the game should back and see what the eagle think about the holding call the super bowl last year chief were not_ complaining then', 'never understood why any player whatever the position would line offside these guy have been playing this game their whole life and are the best what they you not_ even have move your bod just use couple neck muscle turn your head and look unbelievable', 'because the chief have gotten many favorable call over the year mahomes wanted all the spotlight him the bill won this game and they not_ even get applauded for because the only thing that people are going remembering from this game this play where the penalty rightly called mahomes doe not_ need get mad the ref need get mad his receiver for lining offside', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'still one the best play seen this year bad toney did not_ look where standing', 'you are lined receiver and you have look back over your shoulder around the defensive lineman standing next you see the ball you are offside how did toney not_ realize the ball and center behind him', 'doe not_ matter how many time called before you know the rule offside offside end story could have just easily went the line and moved his foot back few inch knew the game stake and did not_ know offside then the person next him should have known', 'looking right the ball how could not_ know move back that him', 'what shocking that toney did not_ drop the lateral from kelce', 'all penalty aside that sweet lateral', 'have always wondered why back lateral were not_ used more they are used effectively flag football know there contact bit easier but done correctly there alot open play for tds like this one', 'bronco fan put joy heart seeing him like this', 'doe look like offside but what cool play the chief are amazing team', 'geez that great throw great catch and amazing pas ending with exciting would have been fun highlight reel kelce probably cannot reenact that lastsecond pas what shame']",65

minecraft minecraftmanhunt manhunt",1043,"i would love a version of this challenge where its teams so 2v2v2 it would be a nice change from 1v3 and so on
this is just gonna be dev babysitting kier for 22 minutes 
a kier and dev a day keeps the brain cells away
im glad boosfer is back doing manhunts with keirr and dev again
hardest challenge in keir and dev history keeping keir alive
download honkai impact 3rd using our link httpshoyolink0wlffbal and start playing now
kier keeps playing with fire at this point dev might make another torture manhunt
the amount of dedication they put in this is more i could put in anything
why does dev always get the most infuriating challenges 
you know its gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
dev started as a hunter and when he got detached he still decided to be speed runner xd
i would love to try some of these challenges myself they seem fun but my computer can barely handle running minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting never mind multiplayer high paced pvp related stuff also i cant speedrun so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this
i love how intense this video was and then the end was the most anticlimactic thing ever
it was supposed to be fun like friends work together actually kinda hit me in the feels feels bad man
kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isnt a bad twist imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
you know id love to see a manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking ie trading doesnt give pearls enderman only spawn in the overworld waterlava source gives cobble and have dev be the speedrunner maybe then hed be kiers speed 3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions in a good way of course

hopescope on tiktok for some laughs",3064,"does this mean were getting an i bought every american girl doll video because i would definitely watch that
i find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because i still see them every year
we loved having you and your team out to the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with us hope
as an american girl doll collector you did amazing at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls im so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again
as a professional baker ive made a barbie cake like that before a few tips for the next time wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in less mess that way also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 
love how you called the newer polly pockets clothes chewy 
i could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game i would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood
hey hope that polly was original but the castle is actually a star castle i had that exact one equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely its own vibe 
as a kid i had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what i was working toward after months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house she was finally mine 
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday so i was surprised to see them in here lol
i had the tiny polly pockets and rollerblading kira she was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything the essence of 1991 i had no idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like a lighter lol 
i wanted a samantha doll more than anything as a kid her books were the reason i started to love to read 
i love seeing how far hope has come i remember watching yall her videos in order and i would get sooo excited when i got a notification saying she posted and i still get as excitedi wish you good luck on reaching 4m
i was 30 in 2004 but the mary kate  ashley game still got me the graphics were crazy lol i remember my children wanting some of these items lol thanks hope
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
actually loving all the background changes in this video  it made it much more animated and fun
i legit had that rollerblade barbie she was my favorite i also think ag dolls were better overall quality when pleasant company was still in control the most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing everything was so true to life with little clasps and now its all cheap velcro but for the same price  also the dolls were made in germany back then  not china
i wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious  i love seeing childhood products i never got to have if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
for the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones you can find them at target it made me so happy to see 
my daughter actually loves polly pockets they make them in different varieties now there are ones with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge bodies and others with plasticsilicone forms called micro polly thats the small compact versions ",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S,"['doe this mean were getting bought every american girl doll video because would definitely watch that', 'find strange that the monster cereal were apparently discontinued because still see them every year', 'loved having you and your team out the electric starship arcade thank you for hanging out with hope', 'american girl doll collector you did amazing pointing out the difference between the era doll happy see many people finding their love for these doll again', 'professional baker have made barbie cake like that before few tip for the next time wrap the lower half your doll plastic wrap before you stick her mess that way also stick her before you decorate the cake that way the bodice the dress match the skirt', 'love how you called the newer polly pocket clothes chewy', 'could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the marykate and ashley mall game would definitely watch live you playing relive childhood', 'hey hope that polly original but the castle actually star castle had that exact one equally cute and nostalgic but definitely own vibe', 'kid had chore chart with picture that 2000s samantha doll taped reminder what working toward after month and month getting few buck week for doing job around the house she finally mine', 'the monster cereal were fully stocked target for halloween this year they bring them back every year for the holiday surprised see them here lol', 'had the tiny polly pocket and rollerblading kira she hip and the little fanny pack everything the essence 1991 had idea they were discontinued but they basically work just like lighter lol', 'wanted samantha doll more than anything kid her book were the reason started love read', 'love seeing how far hope come remember watching you all her video order and would get sooo excited when got notification saying she posted and still get excitedi wish you good luck reaching', '2004 but the mary kate ashley game still got the graphic were crazy lol remember child wanting some these item lol thanks hope', 'hope amazing she put much time work and money into these video just grateful for her', 'actually loving all the background change this video made much more animated and fun', 'legit had that rollerblade barbie she favorite also think doll were better overall quality when pleasant company still control the most noticeable detail were the doll clothing everything true life with little clasp and now all cheap velcro but for the same price also the doll were made germany back then not_ china', 'wish there hour this content scrumptious love seeing childhood product never got have you ever want make this video longer wed watch queen', 'for the polly pocket they brought back the 2000s one you can find them target made happy see', 'daughter actually love polly pocket they make them different variety now there are one with the chewy clothes lol another with the hinge body and others with plasticsilicone form called micro polly that the small compact version']",1182

httpshareepidemicsoundcomphdft",5831,"ive never seen someone buy so many items at a japanese electronic store you must have broken a record 
thanks for having me along for the day man was a lot of fun
hope youve got some snacks ready  this is the longest video weve ever made  which countrys tech do you want us to test next
looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in japan next time round how about scoping out some everyday gizmos would love to see how japans hometech game stacks up against ours
your one of my favorite youtubers arun you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
fun fact there was actually another company in japan called logitec its spelled the same as logitech in japanese and they were in japan before logitech was able to open up anything in japan so they had to change their name to logicool in japan only to avoid a name conflict
this is so surreal ive been letting the abroad in japan channel build up videos to binge and after the frozen frontier series i went back to another video from arun to finish it and i was like oh yeah theres a new video i wanna watch that and now seeing chris walk in was like

the only way i can express the feeling was imagine you watch a tv show and then switch to another tv show only to see the character from the other tv show nonchalantly walk in like what
that trackball mouse is something i used at my job back in the late 80s early 90s youve never seen one before 
this was a great collab  love to watch both yours and chriss channels 
that store completely blows my mind i could be in there for days
love the longer video btw this was enjoyable to watch
i might be one of the few japanese subscribers of your channel your videos are awesome and i genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho hope youll come back soon
i think i can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food genuinely amazing
the timing of those memes is just chefs kiss
i love how excited arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol
the ball mouse is called a trackball pretty useful especially helping reduce rsi its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it also for fine control you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate
3920 first time in japan over twenty years ago taught me that rice is not a bulk up  filler  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion  its a hard sell to a lot of westerners   
but  its my occasional once or twice a year life mission
im a japanese in the uk and i really enjoyed this  shame the kids watch wont work in the uk with child safety more of an issue here than in japan it would probably do relatively well here  i love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years  yum asia do good ones in the uk and not as expensive as the japanese leader but similar technology i didnt see it in the video and i know its not a cooking channel but i hope you washed the rice first 
its my dream to go to japan definitely visiting this tech place when i eventually go 
touch ball mice are used a lot in north america canada more then usa they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as autocad maya blender and image creation such as krita photoshop etc they work very well for a lot of things even gaming i loved mine but the ball has a small accident exactly like the one you had when you picked it up my sister and i nicked named the ball  booots its a joke from baldurs gate 2 with the gigantic minatare space hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling no boots as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over its done and now you are sad i would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion when it fits right you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life so you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how boots died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident after that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality 
final thing there are some that use 24 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3d environment such as 123d autocad and others but it also makes games such as mmorpgs fps and rts a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots especially the multiple sensor ones

so find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the dpi you want and never look back that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments
i love coverage like this id love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device for example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s a portable record player was one of my first repairs id be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then i suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts or vinyl enthusiasts but instead retirees whose entire music collection is in vinyl and are just happy to still be able to play what they have

i felt this way about a few of the items in this video and some recent videos i think its especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices

other than that youve done an amazing job as always and i cant wait to see the next one
thank you so much for giving us so much quality content and being so interesting you look like you had a fun time
this is a dream collab for a long time i watched you guys channels and appreciated you in every video but seeing you conquer the biggest electronic store together is such a nice surprise japan lifestyle carries both futuristic prospects and the relics of the past so any kind of video from there is bound to be the most interesting tech and lifestyle content

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg im sure they were so happy that he joined them soooo adorable
ryan risked losing his apple watch just to test a review mad respect
the fact that ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane
i was cracking up from start to finish thanks man i needed that 
i always worry about content creators ettiquette when theyre recording in public it fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers 
i went on the harry potter ride many times but this one time i did actually get stuck for a few minutes the people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so i could go on again without waiting i have to say it was worth it 
watching ryan and his dad have fun at the place theyve talked about going together for so long is really heartwarming 3
as someone whos been to universal studios once and loved every second of it i was shocked to learn it had such a low review score i guess the waiting just doesnt bother me that much since im already used to disneyland waiting time
i dont know why but asking the kid if she knew janelle made me laugh so hard and then you saying she is upset and the kid going oh comedy gold
ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist 
i love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh 
universal studios is very popular so there is a reason why its so packed and that the lines are so long there really isnt anything the workers can do to change that the main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line some lines are kinda crazy of course there are a few rides in the harry potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties the ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride whenever ive gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
ryan trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content he took this to an absolute infinity win
i agree with mark we got stuck on the harry potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out i was scared and didnt know anybody else on the same coaster so i just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere
i watch your videos on regular days but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better thank you ryan
ryan never fails to make me smile

httpvevoly8pd51s",1470,"at this point being a teenage girl with olivias music is a privilege
her vocals have improved so much better since drivers licence
her voice her passion her act  her melody her story  her visual everything about her is just perfect
imagine singing this live without backing tracks and just with your raw voice this was absolutely hard hats off to olivia
her vocals her high notes literally everything about her is amazing
her vocals is so amazing both live and in the studio
olivias vocals live or studio never fail to amaze me this quiet but powerful version is amazing
this song is really hard to sing and i applaud her courage to sing this live
was her singing perfect here no 
did her singing move me yes
her delivery the lyrics the piano it moved me and i love her live versions of vampire
i was so surprised to see she had no earpiece she did so well  what i really dont understand though is people saying her vocals have improved so much like huh she has always been this good live maybe her confidence grew and her vocal techniques got better but shes always been an incredible live performer
love this her talent has bloomed so dramatically in the past 10 years videos like this prove this to be true
her voice is so perfect and angelic love you olivia xoxo cant wait to see you in concert
her vocals really improved so much from the past years great job mother liv
ik she has some voice cracks in this but the fact that she still sounds amazing live says something she sounds just like how she does in studio recordings and nobody should hating on her for having voice cracks in her live performances every singer has them sometimes so dont hate on our amazing liv 
olivia conveys so much emotion in every song i love seeing artists perform with no gimmicks just a beautiful girl and her piano well done

alan deserves an oscar award
the cowboy hat was clever at first i thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until i realized it also was there to contextualize tscs rotational position in 3d space since otherwise we wouldnt be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape which most of them were
if you could turn this format into a video game youd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics
please never stop doing these biology chemistry logic history anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation thank you
for a spiritual seeker physics student this is emotional
as a physics student i can say that this is amazing i see were going for an interstellar interpretation of singularities which is cool to see as well
alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
this was absolutely stunning to watch i cant wait to see what comes next

maybe an animation vs chemistry 

chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts
genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts its like a whole season of bill nye compressed to the size of a single episode you would make an excellent teacher
one of the most relaxing videos i have ever seen proud to say i learned something from this and glad to know i get to exist at the same time as this all the work youve done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given
as a guy who loves physics i absolutely love this from classical mechanics to general relativity then quantum mechanics alan and his team are do amazing job at this
absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation i absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works keep up it up you and your team are absolutely amazing
woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown just like in math physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity acceleration friction gravity and many more i honestly love how you visualize every details that some people dont know which is crazy i remember learning physics during my high school years until college i know that it sounds really difficult to understand but im sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics thank you so much alan becker and the whole team for making this animation i hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals 
im loving these new new animations  there is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time

amazing job and i cant wait to see whats next
as a civil engineering major junior this and animation vs math have brought me to tears both of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why im still passionate about what im studying thank you 3
this is one of the most impressive things ive seen on youtube in a while respect to the team behind it
this is by far my favorite animation on this channel its so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully you deserve a damn oscar for this
spectacular animation as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that ive learned and for the ones that i have yet to learn it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is and why it is being used in the manner that it is one particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions
this video was a masterpiece from start to finish it has wonderful animation a mere loud story the way you played with lighting and music was genius and it shows the way physics work in a marvellous and fun way both what we know and what we dont 1010",1,Film & Animation,25500000,PT16M8S,"['anything not_ accurate blame lead animator the physic nerd behind this watch the reactioncommentary here', 'alan deserves oscar award', 'the cowboy hat clever first thought just random aesthetic choice until realized also there contextualize tscs rotational position space since otherwise would not_ able tell what direction his body facing unless the surrounding object and environment were not_ symmetrical shape which most them were', 'you could turn this format into video game you would have incredibly powerful tool teach kid physic', 'please never stop doing these biology chemistry logic history anything you think you can display the concept with your team incredible animation thank you', 'for spiritual seeker physic student this emotional', 'physic student can say that this amazing see were going for interstellar interpretation singularity which cool see well', 'alan successfully escalated from classical mechanic string theory', 'this absolutely stunning watch cannot wait see what come next', '', 'maybe animation chemistry', '', 'chemistry much more complex than most people realise and the kind thing you can with are nut', 'genuinely brilliant demonstration these concept like whole season bill nye compressed the size single episode you would make excellent teacher', 'one the most relaxing video have ever seen proud say learned something from this and glad know get exist the same time this all the work you have done incredible and deserves all the praise ever given', 'guy who love physic absolutely love this from classical mechanic general relativity then quantum mechanic alan and his team are amazing job this', 'absolutely beautiful portrayal such complex topic simplified and fun animation absolutely adore your passion and commitment these amazing work keep you and your team are absolutely amazing', 'woah this animation super amazing and mind blown just like math physic lot broad and interesting topic like velocity acceleration friction gravity and many more honestly love how you visualize every detail that some people not_ know which crazy remember learning physic during high school year until college know that sound really difficult understand but sure that this animation will help lot student motivates them study more about physic thank you much alan becker and the whole team for making this animation hope that you guy continue make more this with new learning and creative visuals', 'loving these new new animation there much information packed into every frame and equation with storyline the same time', '', 'amazing job and cannot wait see what next', 'civil engineering major junior this and animation math have brought tear both them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why still passionate about what studying thank you', 'this one the most impressive thing have seen youtube while respect the team behind', 'this far favorite animation this channel complex yet simple the same time and executed beautifully you deserve damn oscar for this', 'spectacular animation physic student clearly and intuitively presented many the concept that have learned and for the one that have yet learn described such way that even without the practice instruction the simplicity and action allows for good understanding what each variable and why being used the manner that one particular example would your demonstration gravity assist for even without ever having been involved equation the sort the explanation through animation able clearly demonstrate why the input variable were there and generate broad stroke understanding how the equation function', 'this video masterpiece from start finish wonderful animation mere loud story the way you played with lighting and music genius and show the way physic work marvellous and fun way both what know and what not_ 1010']",968

its incredible how relevant lb has been since 2003 in the nba
the inseason was a great addition good work nba
honestly we can all agree the in season tournament is a great addition with the court being all fancy and good looking i really enjoyed it all i just wish ad was just consistent as this
nba administration gave to the players another reason to play not only championship but also winning something else would be moralbooster great job  
if only ad play like this every game he will become mvp for sure
in season tournament was a nice addition
lets go lakers  
this is the ad every lakers fan wants to see he bossed it tonight and lebron adding yet another trophy to his list he aint stopping for anybody just yet this in season tournament has been a really cool addition even if the courts havent looked most pleasing but i hope its here to stay
nba thank you for adding this tournament because this just hypes the regular and play offs season of that year and makes us know that even the unexpected teams can win it
what a feelgood moment 
at least we had a chance to witness the championship pedigree of the lakers feelz like 2020 all over again
the lakers are strong dayum
loved watching reeves come up hope it sticks
buen formato daivis demostrando que es el hombre del saco y lebron que sigue siendo el rey de la nba
if ad can maintain this form every game  lakers will be cruising the west
congratulations to the la lakers what ad did in this game was what i expected from brook lopez the kind of pass lebron was giving ad   wwas what i expected from lillard  middleton they failed to use their size advantage like the lakers did
this tournament should be taken only by lebronthis dude is the real winner in this generation

bloxfruits  roblox gamerrobot gaming",38802,"kitsune beautiful 
the sounds effects are so satisfying
theres something ive dreamed of seeing in blox since i started playing collision between attacks being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible using the ice x to stop attacks for example this would definitely change the blox combat style as well as making it more complex and in my opinion interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful
i personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island i think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled tree top
the z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender x move is lookin like the best combo starter fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer f is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage base

mode
riding is ultimate furry half joking lol
z move looks alot better fits the transformation
x move is honestly worse than non mode x range is way to short and can only be used as an extender but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
c move is practically the same just more aoe and probably damage
f move is just a slightly better version of itself not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

opinion is leopard better yes and no leopard is more spammy than kitsune but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

bonus fox lamp
z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it 
x tap good extender with seemingly good damage
xhold imo worse than tap x but better for aoe

is it better than the best sword aka cdk no it has potential but cdk has more combo potential and most likely more damage

i wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol
timestamps please pin this as it helps many people

kitsune fruitmythical
value higher than leoas showed on twitter

showcase 226
z move accursed enchantment 244

v transform 440
when allied with someone they can ride the saddle on the kitsune

passive 805 you can run on water after transforming


fox lamp weapon

z move scorching azure 842
x move infernal firestorm 914
both moves can be held for more damage
the devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
i wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless i do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
most visually pleasing fruit imo hope for more much better updates to come been playing this quite a while and although i hate grind games this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games ive ever played
moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations i am looking forward to using this fruit in the future
this seems to be a good antiteamer fruit flashy incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others plus i see amazing combo potential with kitsune and fox lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
i started playing blox fruits a while back and blox fruits has really stepped up their game they have recently come out with update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new max level this new max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play they also definetly know what they are doing they always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often this update 20 came out somewhat around the time of one piece live action which means that when players watch one piece live action they might understand more about blox fruits and want to play well done blox fruits 
i think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon i hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion
i love this fruit and all the mechanics the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers cant wait for the dragon and control rework

it would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragons moves just to see if they are worth buying
055
lets just appreciate how much a lot of time gamer robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day huge respect  
when transforming like a fox maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler
maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work
i think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run  skycamp with tbh

brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
por primera vez estoy muy emocionada por la actualizacin pero en serio me siento mal por que ya no podr conseguir el brawl pass con gemas  pero al menos se compensa un poco con la mejora que le pusieron a las recompensas gratis
an as gracias supercell
the star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past the fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all

burgers and microwaves together again in our hearts or more to the point our arteries
previously a dark combination of damp spongey bread and reheated mashedup cow flesh theyve improved over the years mostly by telling you to toast the bun now weve got some superbudget microwaveable snacks  burger sausage and hot dog  to look at so er lets do that

microwave burger ashens",922,"nothing beats a classic ashens food special 
ah ashens once again showing his enlightened hotdog technique
wow ashens is really dedicated to travel all the way from dans place in redacted to norwich and back just for some microwave burgers
i mean for 90p its definitely a better option than rustlers which used to be cheapish and are now basically as much as a proper sandwich
crazy how you could make both an advent video with dan and this on the same day crazy
627
you can see the bun slowly reinflating itself as ashens positively remarks on the taste
ive had these before the cheapest feasters yellow packaging are disgusting but the more expensive ones red packaging are actually very nice
for some reason ive been binge watching these videos and i literally cannot distinguish between a 9 year old video and a brand new one
thankfully ashens aged better than most of the food in his videos 
you put the mustard on that hotdog perfectly
as an asda employee i see feasters come through the tills quite often i shall now forever think of ashens everytime i see one
only ashens could have me enthusiastic about looking at feasters
hotdogs marketed specifically as microwave hotdogs have always confused me bread rolls arent expensive and its not like you cant do a normal hotdog in the microwave
oh microwaved hotdogs one of the things i never thought i would miss from going to grandmas after school shes still alive and i am a grown hairy arsed man man just no one told me id have to watch her slowly lose her memories and herself i hope she goes quietly without pain
feasters is just the brand name asda uses instead of rustlers for its microwave burgers theyre exactly the same
feasters will use ashens quotes in their promotional materials for the sausage bap like you can tell theres something in there and its not superunpleasant
for me the aldi version of these is my fave price measured against taste theyre a godsend as a midnight snack after erm yknow a few wobbly imbibements saved me a fortune on impulsive dirty takeaways
from my long experience working at call centres the number 1 use case for this sort of thing is for when youve got a 30 minute lunch break and tesco ready meals want a full 8 of those minutes in the microwave plus cooling time
it doesnt look terrible too be honest these kinds of burgers and sandwiches are kind of a guilty pleasure of mine ive made many an acceptably agreeable breakfast out of the odd microwave burger
stuart is eating food that hasnt expired im impressed

GB,_SI8bPuHx54,becoming the uks best fisherman in 6 months,fish with carl,2023-12-09T11:45:03Z,,132119,4369,"tournament or match fishing is exciting and lucrative if youre any good at it in this video im fishing my way toward a 30000 prize 
check out my vlogs morefishwithcarl 
learn more about fishing on my fishingtutorials channel
follow me on instagram httpsinstagramcomfishwithcarl
for my books clothing and more httpsfishwithcarlcouk

my fishing videos are supported by korda and guru tackle so big thanks to them",442,"carl  in my honest opinion your videos have become as good as if not better than most tv shows the quality is brilliant and other than bob and paul in gone fishing you are the man  keep up the great job mate 
fair play to you for giving it a go i took up match fishing after 25 years of pleasure angling its a massive step to take and a whole different mentality and im only fishing at club level the golden rule i was told at the start of my journey is never tell the truth about your catch or your tactics and never believe what others tell you about their catch or tactics it has served me well over the last couple of years  

in all seriousness though once you get past the nerves and self consciousness of fishing shoulder to shoulder with some very competent match anglers it really does force you to think about how youre fishing and its done more to improve my fishing than any amount of booksmagazinesvideos have ever done plus that first time you frame even if the prize is a mere tenner is an awesome feeling still waiting to get my first win ive been within 2oz but ill get there 

great video as always
cant wait to watch love the videos thanks for getting me into this sport loved the video keep it up
my dad was a match angler and remember him telling me tales about winning with small silvers i enjoy pleasure fishing i only started up again properly this year and have had some great sessions on my own and with friends even when i blank that time spent outside engaging with your surroundings is priceless like you said at the end fishing is what you make it and for me the removal of lifes stresses for a few hours is cathartic
bloody awesome carl what ever it is youve got it youre becoming the new john wilson he was so watchable just like you and your team keep up the good work its so appreciated
as a match angler this film was right up my peg big fan of matt and rooney  would love to see more content like this maybe try tackling a a match on a commercial venue on the pole would be amazing well done on coming so heartbreakingly close though hope you have another go in the future
awesome vid as always carl
hats off to the match men catching as many as quickly as possible is a skill in itself but takes the fun out of fishing when theres pressure and money involved pleasure and specimen fishing is definitely the best in my opinion
geat video carl being a former match angler i know that diving into the match scene as a newbie is no walk in the park if youre a decent angler you can rock it when youre in your element fishing the waters you know and love its all about that knowhow 
but to keep knocking it out of the park in different waters with various fishing styles tackling different species and handling all the different situations you might face youve gotta clock in those years and years of experience 
id love to see you giving it more tries in the future youve got the gear you need now and the best guys to support you for sure keep up the great work
you are so inspiring carl  way to go on getting the two tickets omi this would have been a rather short video if you relied on carls computer  you gave match fishing a shot carl and you were so close to competing in the finals  i love it when you upload videos it always makes my weekend  and i dont say this enough but you are an advocate for people that suffer from anxiety and depression whether you know it or not
hope you dont give up so early your on the learning curve and should try again next season building on what you have learnt this year
the balls it take to put yourself out on youtube from zero respect man and you are a great great fisherman literally best youtuber too
the fact carl consistently pumps out content that is miles above 90 of the tv being made and with such a small team is insanity

his potential is literally limitless
i work in an fishing shop and the talk i hear about the match scene im a carp angler tells me two things it is always the luck of the draw and getting a good peg and also knowing the venue and how it fishes in various conditions is also key the guys that do well fish a lot of matches and fish the venues on a regular basis personally i think it was an incredible result to do as well as you did keep it going
loved this dont give up but do try to keep sane as i bet matches will test your mind management it would be great to see more nearmisses so keep them coming  
i dont even really like coarse fishing but yet find myself watching all your videos they are so well put together epic content mate

please try this again i want to see you make the final
there is never a dull moment with you carl great angler and my favourite also thank you for my new jumper and hat from yourself
great video as always carl i feel sick loosing a fish when im just pleasure fishing cant imagine how it feels in match  great effort mate 
i look forward to watching your videos with a cuppa every time you upload them its great to watch and see that you remind me of me in many ways this match fishing journey was great to watch and i hope you have another chance to do this again next year and prove to guru that you have what it takes

another top guest ollie was would be great to see the three golf lifers take on three of the cricket team or any team really also be good to see ollie back in summer time as i bet he hits it a mile in dry weather
get to get pope in and hear him speak golf cricket and get to know him a little great how you boys are branching out and reaching other sports people just cant help but love all things golf life up the golf life 

i do think you should have a team gl v ben and the fozcast lot have a few challengesforfeits etc maybe invite some of us legends along top work tubes ange and the boys 
18 months playing this sport now twice a week even with the cold snap playing off 16 at the moment my goal is to get to around 12 in the next 2 years im 6ft 5 and 17 stone so the driver once hit clean travels my issue is not having soft enough hands around the approach of the green anything 80 yards to 50

anyway top guest ollie was a real nice bloke which really made this video a calm and great watch
i thought youd got the stig playing today guys and ollie what a decent young lad  keep up the golf life you legends

loving it boys my golf game in the last 2 months since i been watching your channel has improved so much im out there enjoying golf and having a laugh my handicap has came down from 22 to 17 so far and dropping keep up the inspiration loving the channel
great video again boys what about a series of getting tubes and ange to single figures you boys have lessons with your club pro that are filmed and its like a journey ask us lot what a realistic target is for you both and film over time starting from next season
another great video guys what a legend pope is cracking player i have never noticed this before but when he hit his 4 iron it made me wonder if he uses single length irons again tubes i owe you a beer for cobra putter recommendation i am so impressed with mine my putting has transformed
petition to see tubes  ange back playing more

comment omg get over it already ur reading this

kurtisconner",7115,"when i see a new kurtis upload i jump up and down and squeal like a little pig
thinking wed actually get a barbie analysis from kurtis was too good to be true
i understand the trilogy has come to an end but a bonus round comparing barbie video games to bratz video games is kind of warranted
thank you so much to the pokmon company international for sponsoring todays video click the link here to download pokmon unite

i loved that kurtis reverted back to poc women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt poc women an ally through and through
how dare thee call me a wizard has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
i dont think im ready for the barbie vs bratz series to end
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i havent skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a barbie girl from childhood to now i am praying for a new andor remake of the bratz liveaction barbie was phenomenal for what it was imagine what we could have with bratz and to add we need a better monster high liveaction i said what i said
so glad the microchips line thats been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved lifesized as much as many of us did
congratulations on being sponsored by pokmon so proud and happy for you
as a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with bratz
glad the you dont have a daddy or a bankaccount line got the recognition it deserves been on my mind for years 
as a hispanic person yasmins part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
you should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more please and thanks target audience reached

danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
for me barbie in the nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation
i would just like to point out that dannys little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker its a toy soldier
did you drink enough water today shoutout to air up for sponsoring this video try scentbased taste right now you cant miss all these holiday deals httpsairuplink3mmlipo
i could not take it with the dads reaction to the pebble i was laughing so hard the blank stare the trembling hands the concerned look from his wife like what could this rock have possibly done to you why do they never talk about it again
i love how what started as a quirky and unconventional nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left danny with more questions than answers about the original tale
fun fact this movie was funded by literal russian state and was the most expensive russian movie to date
ill be honest as a ballerina just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was hysterical
i would gladly watch you review ballets swan lake has like 4 different endings i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives
as a ballerina watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious especially when you referred to fritz as this little freak
that end bit scared me so bad i actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat seeing danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing ive witnessed in a while
its nice to see danny hasnt lost his christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen
can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with dannys toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass
i laughed so hard i fell off my bed when he said he misses his pebble
im honestly surprised that danny didnt make the connection that love on a leash also had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form now i just wanna know if theres any more movies with characters like that
what a stunning cast baby elle fanning snowbell from stuart little and moaning myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of the nutcracker the worlds ever seen
hiring albert einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex ive ever seen
thank you for watching the ballet danny sincerely every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the nutcracker
my little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago i rented this for her hoping shed love it i feel so bad

shout out to all the loan survivors 
uk rappers are finally getting love in the us it took way too long but anyone who hasnt been following uk grime and drill is going to be surprised at the talent thats been overlooked
harlow went fucking crazy one of his top tracks for sure 
dave is genuinely an expert at the lengthy verses i think this is jacks best song yet as well
jacks really following his mentors footsteps with this level of consistency he is really going places

fortnite fortnitetips lego legofortnite fortnitelego guide gaming gameplay minecraft survivalgame  fortnitebattleroyale tipsandtricks legofortnitetips",247,"when the npcs are glitching out like that then try talking to them first  if that doesnt work then continue doing what youre doing
one thing i like about the prefab builds is theyre modular you can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with shack doors to create passible outbuildings
biggest building issue ive had is there doesnt seem to be a way to change the elevation of your nonprefab foundations making it hard to keep things at the same level
destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
you can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches  yes it costs more wood however itll light up the cave for you so its easier to find whatever your looking for
before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating not a tip
dont just throw away tools that you dont use use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it they can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation
really fantastic synopsis and tips you nailed it i would add 
build your first village at the edge of a desert border and near a knotwood cave not where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient
build a bed at the mouth of a cave as a save point if you die you respawn in your bed you wont have to travel back to your quest point
empty almost all of your backpack before beginning a quest youll need the inventory slots
pack for a trip max wood planks to build repair chests cooked food snowberry shakes or cheesy burgers
its good to stack lumber mills it makes crafting so much quicker
something i always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever i need to collect granite i take that villager and start going at some rocks unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
if you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and itll destroy everything for you
go on top of moutains that have large trees cut them down roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
i love to make a village stylish and neat it is the most important thing 
man this was one of the coolest surprises of the year  ive always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome  whod have thought it would be fortnite to do it
youre lucky  the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and thats with infinite stamina  however the cold biome is 2 steps away
make glider  build staircases 11 high make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as i land i build another one so i can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol i even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so i know the direction they follow back to back  helps tons on the map
stamina bar is important when youre flying with a glider it consumes your stamina while up in the air by the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die
i personally think temp dont matter as muchbut stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didnt go down so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills lumber mills work benches etc then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
the way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me that way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells and the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S,"['when the npc are glitching out like that then try talking them first that doe not_ work then continue doing what you are doing', 'one thing like about the prefab build they are modular you can knock out the wall double shack and replace them with shack door create passible outbuilding', 'biggest building issue have had there doe not_ seem way change the elevation your nonprefab foundation making hard keep thing the same level', 'destroying bush actually easier with sword', 'for right now traveling the main issue cannot that you have walk min just get cave once you mined the cave kind nearby your village walk min the next dessert just you can die bcs you did not_ know that the mob there are way stronger', 'you can also build campfire inside cave instead using torch yes cost more wood however will light the cave for you easier find whatever your looking for', 'before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting cheating not_ tip', 'not_ just throw away tool that you not_ use use villager follower and you can give them those tool and they will use they can hold multiple tool and just swap the best one depending the situation', 'really fantastic synopsis and tip you nailed would add', 'build your first village the edge desert border and near knotwood cave not_ where you spawn into the game make your life easier and everything more efficient', 'build bed the mouth cave save point you die you respawn your bed you will not_ have travel back your quest point', 'empty almost all your backpack before beginning quest you will need the inventory slot', 'pack for trip max wood plank build repair chest cooked food snowberry shake cheesy burger', 'good stack lumber mill make crafting much quicker', 'something always with the spare pickax give one designated adventuring villager and whenever need collect granite take that villager and start going some rock unfortunately they still use the pickax for fighting even over even though the brown pickaxe doe damage per second compared just punching keep that mind you are messing about the dark with them', 'you find boulder hill and you need mat just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and will destroy everything for you', 'top moutains that have large tree cut them down roll the log down farm granite and wood super easy', 'love make village stylish and neat the most important thing', 'man this one the coolest surprise the year have always thought minecraft style game the lego world would awesome who would have thought would fortnite', 'you are lucky the desert minute run away from spawn point and that with infinite stamen however the cold biome step away', 'make glider build staircase high make platform and you now got jump pad that will take you way further then the geyser and soon land build another one can basically the whole map under min instead hour lol even put marker every staircase jump pad know the direction they follow back back help ton the map', 'stamen bar important when you are flying with glider consumes your stamen while the air the time you run out you will drop from fall damage and die', 'personally think temp not_ matter muchbut stam will literally make you the beginning because you can just outrun most early thing like wolf', 'noticed when you broke your grill the village point did not_ down technically you could just place down crap ton grill lumber mill work bench etc then destroy them get the material back and again and again', 'the way get the sand shell using shield and getting one villager follow that way follower can get the attention and can ham for the shell and the shield help the randomly start going for you']",668

i like the new fortnite lego game mode its something new and fresh
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest its way better than we all expected
one can only imagine how theyre going to continue developing the mode it has so much potential i cant wait to see where we go from here personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
also i found out if youre behind a bush while killing the boss dude he wont attack you he gets confused also another glitch if you put down a new chest and put your swords farming tools etc in it and punch it to break it it heals your weapons and farming tools note this will be patched asap im sure but it works for now
i hope you enjoyed the new mode its been a ton of fun for me and the boys 
i think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby as a person who experienced that myself today was my first time playing chapter 5 i absolutely loved battle royale but i clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in lego
i had some experience with motion capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall kudos to the devs its a funny detail you wouldnt neccessary expect in a game like this one ps you almost saw me as leon in these new resident evil games 
so far this mode is pretty similar to minecraft if they update regularly this can become an original masterpiece
keep it up creamy the new mode is really fun tho
you know its a good day when mccreamy uploads
ive been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative im so excited for this game mode theres so many possibilities
mccreamy is a legend bro makes a boring day into a good one love this guy 
i think that this is the best day that theyve had in a while amazing job fortnite 
mccreamy never fails to make good content  
can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 
i love how he steps out of his way just to entertain us
you can tell this mode is gonna be succesfull and i trust epic games in keeping it updated and interesting

cant wait to see 20mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh
really happy to see where smosh is currently
i almost teared up when anthony at the end says that shayne has kept the true meaning of smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera its so true and thats what makes smosh so special especially the cast now you can see how close everyone is with each other and from ian and anthony to chance and angela the newest cast members everyone just puts a big smile on my face
come back next week for a new assumptions episode with openly gay pastors

man at the beginning when anthony started listing all the eras shayne went through i got so sad these people carried smosh through its darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old smosh shayne courtney damien etc truly are the unsung heroes of smosh
ill basically watch shayne do anything for any amount of time
i love this era of smosh smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter were now honoring smosh for everything theyve done and seeing how theyve become a giant family warms my heart what a time to be alive
shaynes depth as a human is what made me enjoy smosh more i remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is as someone else who loves reading and thinks it more than anything else can develop a person that was nice to see  hes genuine intelligent and over the top absurd love him
dearest shayne i cant tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on smosh this entire time we dont know what we would ever do without you you are not only hilarious but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member i see how invested you are in other people we all love you and please keep doing what youre doing
ian and anthony are the parents of main but pit and games are shaynes babies he really carried those channels for so long my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic woo shayne shayne it up
i actually really like the idea of interviewing smosh cast members
shayne is just such a pleasant person he seems so fun and nice to be around love seeing anthony and shayne together again the we bought smosh arc really is the best timeline
the way shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how i know he has the brain of an artist
him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome  deserves the world honestly
im glad that shayne is getting some flowers hes clearly a comedy powerhouse and very hardworking and loyal but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person im sure success will find him whatever he gets up to but im glad its smosh right now 
i respect everything that shane has done as he is my favorite cast member he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to smosh  has helped kept it alive alongside courtney  ian
not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but i feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way
im gonna be honest the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of shayne i find him the most funny comforting relatable and inspiring personality on the internet love you shayne
i dont know if shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry like i remember that scene of the office when jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives and we can see all that with shayne anthony and the rest of the smosh crew theyre all incredible people and its awesome to see how far they have all grown
shayne seriously rules him being popular enough to have his own thing going but just not doing it because being around the others is just too fun is so genuine and heartwarming jeez im floored massive talent and heart courtney and him kept the dream alive now amanda and angela are also just such fun standouts this era is peak",27,Education,7580000,PT31M26S,"['anthony telling shayne how important smosh how much respect him major highlight shayne deserves his flower', 'cannot wait see 20mins shayne not_ being able take compliment', 'shayne such talent and been such great addition smosh', 'really happy see where smosh currently', 'almost teared when anthony the end say that shayne kept the true meaning smosh there all along just having fun with friend camera true and that what make smosh special especially the cast now you can see how close everyone with each other and from ian and anthony chance and angela the newest cast member everyone just put big smile face', 'come back next week for new assumption episode with openly gay pastor', 'member watch uncensored free', 'man the beginning when anthony started listing all the era shayne went through got sad these people carried smosh through darkest time but they were underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia old smosh shayne courtney damien etc truly are the unsung hero smosh', 'ill basically watch shayne anything for any amount time', 'love this era smosh smosh been pretty transparent and communicative towards fan and seeing all the ups and down the company make this moment much more sweeter were now honoring smosh for everything they have done and seeing how they have become giant family warms heart what time alive', 'shaynes depth human what made enjoy smosh more remember them showing his apartment one time and seeing how well read someone else who love reading and think more than anything else can develop person that nice see genuine intelligent and over the top absurd love him', 'dearest shayne cannot tell you how much mean everyone that you have stayed smosh this entire time not_ know what would ever without you you are not_ only hilarious but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting know each cast and crew member see how invested you are other people all love you and please keep doing what you are doing', 'ian and anthony are the parent main but pit and game are shaynes baby really carried those channel for long respect for him grew much during the pandemic woo shayne shayne', 'actually really like the idea interviewing smosh cast member', 'shayne just such pleasant person seems fun and nice around love seeing anthony and shayne together again the bought smosh arc really the best timeline', 'the way shayne describes the pride feel creating beloved character how know the brain artist', 'him being kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having imposter syndrome deserves the world honestly', 'glad that shayne getting some flower clearly comedy powerhouse and very hardworking and loyal but also just seems like genuinely kind person sure success will find him whatever get but glad smosh right now', 'respect everything that shane done favorite cast member multi talented individual that brought much smosh helped kept alive alongside courtney ian', 'not_ trying discredit the other team member who have helped with keeping the channel alive course but feel like having those people the forefront and all the sacrifice they made have paid off big way', 'going honest the only reason started watching smosh and still watch smosh because shayne find him the most funny comforting relatable and inspiring personality the internet love you shayne', 'not_ know shayne holding back tear but when speaking really made cry like remember that scene the office when jim say that the documentary people gave them the blessing being able actually look back into their life and can see all that with shayne anthony and the rest the smosh crew they are all incredible people and awesome see how far they have all grown', 'shayne seriously rule him being popular enough have his own thing going but just not_ doing because being around the others just too fun genuine and heartwarming jeez floored massive talent and heart courtney and him kept the dream alive now amanda and angela are also just such fun standouts this era peak']",1886

if blade turns out to be as good as dishonored 2 it will be a memorable experience being 100 singleplayer is a great start
i couldve shed a tear when they said itll be a thirdperson single player game

thank you arkane lyon
getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most blade thing ever
so glad that a gameplayfocused studio like arkane is doing blade some of the most fluid gunsword gameplay in the biz
perfect mix of character studio and platform
cant wait to see more of this
finally one of my favorite characters gets his own game i love the dark ominous feel that this has 3rd person single player too yes please
ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it i just get excited that someone is making blade
loving the art style already this is definitely going to be visually stunning
love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop it gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires
esto ser un gran juego gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
this a blade game is a fantastic idea this has so much potential the artstyle colour and lighting is astonishing the character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and blade looks like he came straight off the pages 

and the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed the elements of dishonoured and deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit blades combat and abilities out of the upcoming marvel games this is my favourite
glad to see blade gets a new game hopefully they will do the character justice fingers crossed
the fact that were getting the game before the movie is bizarre but im so excited i cant wait for it this looks so dope
esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos

long talks
red eyes

missing a moment when youre still there

yeahyeah
kissing
screaming
straight back to war
im walking out until i lock the door
maybe the dangers covered by the thrill
cause i know i should be running for the hills 

the way you touch me
straight to the heart yeah
it cuts me
cause i know deep down that its
never gonna ever be us ohhh
never gonna ever be more than just something thats fucking me up
dont tease me
and keep me around like its easy
cause you know deep down that its
never gonna ever be us ohhh
never gonna ever be more than just something thats fucking me up 

i know that when its all done
ill hate you bad in the long run
but somehow it never ends
my heels on the edge of your bed again yeah
i get obsessive with you
all that i want is attention from you
break into my life and break all my rules its true 

the way you touch me
straight to the heart yeah
it cuts me
cause i know deep down that its
never gonna ever be us ohhh
never gonna ever be more than just something thats fucking me up
dont tease me 
and keep me around like its easy  

cause you know deep down that its
never gonna ever be us ohhh
never gonna ever be more than just something thats fucking me up 

should be running for the hills should run for the hills should be running for the hills
the way you touch me
should run for the hills should run for the hills should be running for the hills
the way you touch me
should run run run for the hills should be running for the hills
the way you touch me
should run run run for the hills should be running for the hills
the way you touch me

sorry for the confusion i made the list for myselfadded the games i interested with btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event you can look for them
the orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of oscars the flute guy especially man he absolutely nailed it
i loved hearing the alan wake director speak on both occassions he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching
12915 loved geoff keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the hello kitty game best moment for me
lets all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there what a legend
congratulations larian you absolutely deserve all these awards and more
congratulations to every other winnernominee as well

in all honesty bg3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo but im happy totk ff16 alan wake 2 and hifi rush won some awards as well would have been perfect if lies of p won best art direction
sami jrvi aka sam lake just is remedy entertainment
this guy is living his job 
performing the choriography with poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make
remedy pretty much never dissappoints
cheers
flute guy is the pillar of the game awards that absolutely everyone can get behind we may all like different games but our celebration of flute guy is unanimous
huge congratulations to neil newbon and all the other baldurs gate 3 makers you have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves
a game dev that is so committed to his game that he goes to an awards show in a suit of freaking armour kinda deserves the win huh keep making games larian

cookd out now  httpscookdstore",3468,"i did not sleep since lego came out so i could film and edit this and its still only 9 minutes 
other streamers crying when friends blow up their house 

lazar builds his own house just to blow it up
the fact that the lego mode came out 2 days ago proves that lazar can make videos in that time frame

weve caught him
the fact that lannan is happy and healthy enough to do uploads so quickly really brings me joy really gives early lazar vibes
i find it hilarous that lazar can screw around with literally anything his heart desires
hands down one of the best gamemodes weve gotten
always gonna be a good day when lazar uploads 
lazar never fails to break any game within 12 hours of its release
poor ceeday getting roasted 
lazar being this consistent feels unreal
its truly legendary that lazar is still using the gingerbread skin despite there being a literal skin of him
your creativity in this lego fortnite video is off the charts just like the designs in ytgw0010 truly inspiring work
so cool thing about these golems is that theyre not actually desertspecific either that or they change colour according to whichever biome theyre in
lazar complaning about ceeday not uploading with his upload schedule is criminal
the difference in the amount of time that lazarbeam streamed and the and the amount of time this video is just proves how much he cares about us to be entertained
lazar always finds a way to break every game in existence
i have to say this but this felt like an old lazarbeam video i love just the goofy ideas and music it makes me happy to see this kind of content again thanks lannan
lazar will never fail to attempt to break everything he finds even mullys collarbone

no way new hellogames game

i love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that nms trailers usually are
cant wait for this looks beautiful
the fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very very good thing thats a sign that theyre aiming for density on a much smaller scale despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
i genuinely cannot wait  you guys are some of the hardest working devs around and i really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making nms an incredible game im more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything i love in one game so excited
seeing how far theyve come with nms compared to its initial release makes this game very promising even if its not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning we no theyre 100 capable of making it better over time
as a nms player since day one im all in for light no fire
after the eventual epic success of nms hello games is now one of the few game developers i trust to deliver i cant wait to explore this world
i like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year i am genuinely excited for this i can see this being a huge improvement from nms for the simple reason its just one world which they can build on density
having witnessed the commitment they have shown to no mans sky im all in on this also no mans sky on psvr2 is insane
love the artstyle looks really interesting and after delivering nms you really deserve that this will be a success
what im hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards and some kind of engaging story if they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
everything about this is pure vibes the atmosphere the track selection for the video the editing very well done cannot wait to play this
i dont even know how i feel no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre and you guys delivered that  cant wait
i just want to say im a huge fan of your guys work you guys put passion first and money second unlike the vast majority of companies today
feels like a natural next step from something like valheim which is probably my favourite game ever excited for this the redemption story is nearly fully complete
i cherish each of you transforming an incredible system into a fantastical setting great choice of song as well i adore altj im already very excited about this
this looks great take your time guys its done when its done dont let yourselves get pushed like last time youve build a lot of good will over the years the community is ready to wait and let you cook
i remember playing nms and thinking about how much better it would be if you guys focused all the procedural content into one planet    not saying your procedural universe was bad   turns out you guys were already making that a reality long before i ever even conceived iti dont usually get hyped for gamesbut i am completely hyped for this one

if this is anything like alien isolation then were in for the biggest treat ever man i love that theyre going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place
its incredible how jurassic park has a different sense of tension than jurassic world
yes finally ive been waiting for something like this for years 
to me the ford explorer and jeep wrangler will forever be the real heroes of jurassic park takes me right back to my childhood
i cant believe theyre making an actual jurassic park survival horror game this looks incredible the attention to level of detail eg the ford explorer the jeep wrangler the dinosaurs i like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of jurassic park

hopefully this game doesnt disappoint
ive always wanted a jurassic park game like this
as a huge dino fan this is something im eyeing the most to come out i dont care how short or long i can tell im going to throughly enjoy this
the original islandthe original park this feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90s i dont even play new games anymore but im really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan  
it seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now  it looks promising 
ive been imagining a game like this for about 20 years they finally made one
ive never wanted anything more in my life i knew they were gonna do something like this at some point so happy to finally see it
this is what ive been wanting from jurassic park
the makers of jurassic world must take note from this game this is what a true jurassic movie should look and feel like we need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies
what i would really like in the game jurassic park survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993 it would be completely crazy for example we have the proceratosaurus the metriacanthosaurus the segisaurus herrerasaurus and the baryonyx this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of jurassic park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film it allows us to fill a void 
im going to need more gameplay footage  looks suspiciously like a jumpscare funhouse walk and look adventure
this looks incredible already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay thanks for sharing this trailer
the musicthe scenesthe dinossame place everything is on point i bet playing this will feel like a jurassic park sequel but you are in it
look at how much love went into making this trailer i havent felt the magic this strongly since the first movie

antiques vintage exclusive boise remymartin cognac baccarat",112,"so what i hear is she can drink and enjoy the cognac and still sell the bottle for 2000 thats a win win
rmy martin is my favorite cognac  i always wanted to try a shot of their very old vintage cognac but im too cheap to spend a few hundred dollars on an ounce or two of anything
somehow 8k seems cheap for something to be nearly 100 years old complete in box the finest variant of a famous cognac feels like it should be way more
enjoy this show to this day its amazing what you can learn about the items people bring hoping they are worth something
would sell for over 10k
leave alone for another 15 years and youd have a 100 year old brandy awesome
just drink it and enjoy its just a bottle of alcohol not the holy grail 
it may have value as a rare collectors piece but i dont believe cognac ages once its bottled that happens in casksbarrels before bottling the fact that theres been evaporation makes me worry that the seal has been compromised and the cognac inside may not be especially tasty i guess well never know 
i would think that the only value in the cognac would be the enjoyment of it otherwise its worthless
remy martian cognac is among the finest spirits you can get they distilled for a few years in sonoma county  alambic brandy angles breath filled the   cask room 1990s unfortunately my only last bottle was drank by a bunch of ungrateful people who didnt even know what it was without permission i have a bottle of mistel noel from the distillery and keep it in a safe place
would pair nicely with a 90 year old coke zero
8000 doubt that 

at auction id expect insanely higher prices

remember this is the finest cognac possible said by remy martin and cognac bottles have gone in excess of 1m

i think a fair estimate would be 100k to 250k
my 50th my wife bought me a bottle of dom perignon 1971 we shared it on a mountain resort sitting in a wood fired hot tub over looking the canadian rockies and a valley river got make your life full of good memories
hard liquor bottled in cristal bottles contain high levels of lead that leeches from the glass not to be consumed the longer it sits in the bottle the higher the lead content
sell it you can never drink it and it could go bad or break at any time
drinking cognac makes me feel like the grown up in the room  just 1 sip if only
that kind of bottle was a gift to me i moved and it went missing
i just watched the holdovers yesterday and this is the same bottle that paul giamattis character chugs in the car
just seen an identical bottle in the recent movie the holdover 2023 great film btw worth checking out
the bottle should be signed the bottle should have a number etched on the bottom that must match the number etched on the bottom of the stopper these bottles are so well known there are collectors who collect the empty bottles so not sure why this appraiser acts as if he is unsure of his appraisal this cognac is better known as louis the 13th",24,Entertainment,252000,PT3M32S,"['what hear she can drink and enjoy the cognac and still sell the bottle for 2000 that win win', 'rmy martin favorite cognac always wanted try shot their very old vintage cognac but too cheap spend few hundred dollar ounce two anything', 'somehow seems cheap for something nearly 100 year old complete box the finest variant famous cognac feel like should way more', 'enjoy this show this day amazing what you can learn about the item people bring hoping they are worth something', 'would sell for over 10k', 'leave alone for another year and you would have 100 year old brandy awesome', 'just drink and enjoy just bottle alcohol not_ the holy grail', 'may have value rare collector piece but not_ believe cognac age once bottled that happens casksbarrels before bottling the fact that there been evaporation make worry that the seal been compromised and the cognac inside may not_ especially tasty guess well never know', 'would think that the only value the cognac would the enjoyment otherwise worthless', 'remy martian cognac among the finest spirit you can get they distilled for few year sonoma county alambic brandy angle breath filled the cask room 1990s unfortunately only last bottle drank bunch ungrateful people who did not_ even know what without permission have bottle mistel noel from the distillery and keep safe place', 'would pair nicely with year old coke zero', '8000 doubt that', '', 'auction expect insanely higher price', '', 'remember this the finest cognac possible said remy martin and cognac bottle have gone excess', '', 'think fair estimate would 100k 250k', '50th wife bought bottle dom perignon 1971 shared mountain resort sitting wood fired hot tub over looking the canadian rockies and valley river got make your life full good memory', 'hard liquor bottled cristal bottle contain high level lead that leech from the glass not_ consumed the longer sits the bottle the higher the lead content', 'sell you can never drink and could bad break any time', 'drinking cognac make feel like the grown the room just sip only', 'that kind bottle gift moved and went missing', 'just watched the holdover yesterday and this the same bottle that paul giamattis character chug the car', 'just seen identical bottle the recent movie the holdover 2023 great film the way worth checking out', 'the bottle should signed the bottle should have number etched the bottom that must match the number etched the bottom the stopper these bottle are well known there are collector who collect the empty bottle not_ sure why this appraiser act unsure his appraisal this cognac better known louis the 13th']",212

good to see west indies winning
love from sri lanka
the last time england won a series in the caribbean was in the odi series in 2014 congrats to windies for prolonging the streak
you almost wouldve thought this to be an england home game with the cheers the boys in blue were receiving
nice to see west indies players are bringing back that vibes to the cricket loving nation windies fans deserved this moment they bring carnival atmosphere to cricket we miss you all hope this series win will set up a big step towards your cricket journey lots of love from sri lankan fans
darren sammy always brings the magic he is the x factor for the west indies always has been 
i think west indies cricket is back congratulations west indies love from pakistan 
west indies play very good cricket in their home it is difficult to face them in their home 2024 t20 wc will be one of the best no flat pitches 5050 advantage to bowling and batting excited overloaded 
am i the only west indian that feels super proud of this achievement mr sammy is slowly but surely creating a culture within that team which speaks to fighting for victories and i have to also provide massive kudos to mrhope highlighting to players that yes you always have  more time than you think in the batting department cant leave out shepherd which in my opinion was player of the series wickets when it was crucial and finishing games when it seemed all hope was lost shepherd is going to be a crucial member of west indian success going forward along with athanaze


well played guys lets us not settle for this victory

i am absolutely certain that if 1 of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did regardless of what that may be to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place
thank you james for encouraging people through coffee to do more do better and question what they do
the reason youre not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process no idea the details of how the machine works but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains
its fascinating that the spritzing makes a measurable difference to the extraction of the espresso i could totally see well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality itll probably never mean anything but its amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful quantitative change
i love the citizen science your channel is promoting and that youre encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared there is a signal here we just cant see it yet keep sharing keep signal boosting and keep experimenting
if you close your eyes you can experience what its like to have jon hamm describe coffee physics to you
i think when collecting data from lots of people tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important i keep my house really dry 30 for 3d printing and i see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder which doesnt have any bottleneck so rh may be a significant source of noise

its always a pleasure to watch these videos and even more of a pleasure to watch james slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago  somehow forgot that id since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat  while i cant endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real proustian moment while i played what the hell is that weird perfume flavor
my suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed which usually i would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry the oils in the coffee also probably dont help with that if you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference so a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates this is not contrary to what the prof said it might be a combination of both
even though im not that into coffee and usually just guess each time i make it i absolutely love your videos its not just the information but the candor the dedication without obsession and the curiosity i wish there were clones of you making youtube videos on different topics  itd be a better world
this is fascinating  theres a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee  ive been freezing beans for freshness since i use coffee pretty slowly  an unintended result is that when i take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold  its like getting a mist and mix for no effort  hard to control the amount which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room but interesting nonetheless  ive also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my breville barista express or my fellow ode gen 1 and not surprisingly ive had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders
man this video is surreal i dont think i ever had a chance to meet him specifically but i was just at a small conference with chris hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research i dont think ive ever seen someone ive encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this i suspected that he or his work about coffee though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry would show up here eventually though super exciting stuff
i am super excited that you got a particle size analyzer and from a legit analytical science company like anton paar that is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders burrs grind rpm etc which so far has been limited to assumptions wow that instrument is a significant investment too and im thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune so to speak can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere

im assuming well be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument cant wait 
i used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published my grinder is the new fellow opus it was the first time i did it with the opus because i never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech and i was so surprised that when wet it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when its dry now that this paper has been published im going to try it again
james i would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind my theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators i think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders  the eureka mignon oro has a metal spout and cup
i just tried spritzing for pour over coffee there was less static cling which was nice i also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower i only did it once so it could be a fluke
well done chris and his fellow authors as well as you james what shocks me is that there isnt more science on how to improve the taste of coffee probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively but there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques

whether people love or hate him that promo was a masterclass in putting yourself and others over and making a crowd want to pay to watch you wrestle every person you mentioned you feel like he meant every word
nothing about cm punk ever feels forced or contrived which is so hard to do when cutting wrestling promos he is so good for wrestling regardless of the drama that surrounds him
the fact that punk can use la knights chant made my jaw drop cm punk doesnt break the 4th wall he destroys it
his tone his movement his words his interaction with the audience everything is storytelling everything feels real
i was at survivor series and i still get the chills when this mans music hits
every time his theme song hits the crowd goes absolutely insane i put my headphones on just to feel the reaction of the audience its truly incredible
whether you love him or hate him cm punk knows how to get a crowd going 
his mic skills are off the charts and he never misses a beat
this segment was way better than the one he did on raw this is the cm punk we all needed
incredible crowd management and mic skills it seemed as if he had never stopped wrestling
cm punk promo skills are off the charts and almost second to none his promo skills are on par with top stars like the rock you may hate him but we got to give him credit that he actually got the guts to fight in the octagon he dont even need a catchphrase or someone to interact with to move the crowd in addition he doesnt makes you feel the promo was heavily scripted and thats next level promo guys
was actually one of the soldiers there they showed for about a sec doesnt do justice how insane people went to see cm punk every word he said we hung on to great night that night
like it or not cm punk is the biggest draw everywhere he goes i dont care who your favorite superstar is this man is the reason that even more people are going to watch and even come back to watching wwe now the incline started with cody continued with jade and still continues with punk wwe was is and always will remain the best in the world
he understands the point of pro  wrestling more then a lot of wrestlers do its entire point is to get people to pay money to watch it not to do 450 splashes through flaming tables
i absolutely love the fact he is about to headline mania something that 10 years ago he felt entitled to it took a stint in the ufc a stint in silence the creation of a new wrestling company and the subsequent mismanagement of said company to bring him full circle life is crazy
never been a fan of punk but as he physically alluded he absolutely knocked that promo out of the park got me excited about several different storyline possibilities with call outs some direct and others subliminal expert level stuff
crazy how hes levels above everyone of this era in charisma and mic work that promo was all time
ladies and gentleman were watching the freddie mercury of pro wrestling absolute master on the mic that controls the crowd like no other can one of the best promos weve seen in a very long time what a time to be a wrestling fan
seeing punk back just feels right   i hope him and cena can have one final match before one of them retires  
i wasnt watching during his original run but its great to see him back in wwe hes instantly created such a big buzz and hes back where he belongs",17,Sports,98500000,PT12M6S,"['forget everything else for second there were year where one thought this would ever happen what moment pro wrestling history', 'whether people love hate him that promo masterclass putting yourself and others over and making crowd want pay watch you wrestle every person you mentioned you feel like meant every word', 'nothing about punk ever feel forced contrived which hard when cutting wrestling promos good for wrestling regardless the drama that surround him', 'the fact that punk can use knight chant made jaw drop punk doe not_ break the 4th wall destroys', 'his tone his movement his word his interaction with the audience everything storytelling everything feel real', 'survivor series and still get the chill when this man music hit', 'every time his theme song hit the crowd absolutely insane put headphone just feel the reaction the audience truly incredible', 'whether you love him hate him punk know how get crowd going', 'his mic skill are off the chart and never miss beat', 'this segment way better than the one did raw this the punk all needed', 'incredible crowd management and mic skill seemed had never stopped wrestling', 'punk promo skill are off the chart and almost second none his promo skill are par with top star like the rock you may hate him but got give him credit that actually got the gut fight the octagon not_ even need catchphrase someone interact with move the crowd addition doe not_ make you feel the promo heavily scripted and that next level promo guy', 'actually one the soldier there they showed for about sec doe not_ justice how insane people went see punk every word said hung great night that night', 'like not_ punk the biggest draw everywhere not_ care who your favorite superstar this man the reason that even more people are going watch and even come back watching wwe now the incline started with cody continued with jade and still continues with punk wwe and always will remain the best the world', 'understands the point pro wrestling more then lot wrestler entire point get people pay money watch not_ 450 splash through flaming table', 'absolutely love the fact about headline mania something that year ago felt entitled took stint the ufc stint silence the creation new wrestling company and the subsequent mismanagement said company bring him full circle life crazy', 'never been fan punk but physically alluded absolutely knocked that promo out the park got excited about several different storyline possibility with call out some direct and others subliminal expert level stuff', 'crazy how level above everyone this era charisma and mic work that promo all time', 'lady and gentleman were watching the freddie mercury pro wrestling absolute master the mic that control the crowd like other can one the best promos have seen very long time what time wrestling fan', 'seeing punk back just feel right hope him and cena can have one final match before one them retires', 'not_ watching during his original run but great see him back wwe instantly created such big buzz and back where belongs']",726

she wanna ride with the star
ended up dropping my top ok
my ex told me she needed space
i guess we both going to mars ok
i cannot forget the base
im taking my mop on my dates ok
just look at the look on they faces
they wanna jump in my place ok
told shorty she was the one
but im taking her friends out to tan ok
i told em to load up the dock
but they wanna ride in my benz ok
one of one this a new cullinan
no telling when im a stand ok
aint counting no more dubs again
only fucking with the benjamins ok

straight off of plane to these racks
we gon stunt to the vibes
and we gon keep it going lets go
i through a fit in rick owens ok
momma the shit and she know how she be
aint just talking i got it for sure i dont play
send a boarding pass when she get bored come play
come hop in the urus we touring you
keep it low they know that its roaring
went ceramic the audemar blue 6v
they aint brought em out yet these the new ones
having motion dont ask what im doing
tryna see if she pretty she going
haters hate thats their job they gonna do it
i wear white air force ones the louie
tell a bitch she fumble she blew it
bro aint do it if the lawyer dont prove it
she delusional making up shit in her head and believing it

she wanna ride with the star
ended up dropping my top ok

no telling when im a stand ok
aint counting no more dubs again
only fucking with the benjamins ok

made 100 mill and took over the street
with no sponsor man

told lil bitch to stay off the gram
dont be the first to get hit with that drako
soulja boy or that aubrey graham dont be playing
she holla at the moon i be barking
i am a goon she a goblin
coke boy like loon up in harlem
ramadan but we aint starving
came out the mud on my own
thats word to rick i dont owe em

this was actually creative of simon not just another reaction of sidemen videos 
simons radiant kindness never fails to spread my cheeks
13 hours of nonstop arcade games 25k is crazy for a ps5 
such a wholesome ending to the video and people consider simon the meanest sidemen thats just crazy
props to you simon giving ndiyo that ps5 really made me tear up
he may have spent 4x the cost of a ps5 but he also just made someones christmas well done simon
this video just made my day such a cute ending and a happy one for the gentleman who stayed behind for you goes to show how much you really spend at the arcades but its the memories that makes it worth it
finally a vid that is upto simons standards  w concept
john needs a raise the camerawork is 
such a w video and that ending was the icing on the cake 

i believe if you do good good things comes to you maybe thats part of the reason why are you blessed and honestly happy for you
not even caring about his own satisfaction thats a solid dad out there doing his best my pockets are so empty trying to put smiles on my kids faces for christmas too id have it no other way
in his usual week simon films a sidemen video moresidemen videos sidemenreacts videos and a gaming video daily and he still takes time outside all of this to produce content for all of us truly underappreciated
if this was longer this would have been sidemen sunday level
just another reason to love simon hes the guy who can never let you down
thats really sweet wholesome im happy for the mans kids that was a wonderful way to end the video w for simon in the end 
love this you have just given that kid an incredible christmas but more importantly youve undoubtedly made an even stronger relationship between him and his daughter a small gesture for you can be a massive gesture for others 
after a few minutes i thought to myself im gonna have to slog it out to watch through the whole video cause simons a real one but it was actually more enjoyable than i had presumed

goated ending
hes already got the accolade for the most consistent youtuber
and in my books hes earned the accolade for one of the most genuinely kindhearted people that exist today

a tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
this is an awesome turn for the channel and they dont even always have to be death matches they could be races to loot or securing an area team death matches would be a treat too
the animation team did a fantastic job and congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
as an animator myself ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew  theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics ive seen hollywood do far worse

props allround  super keen to see more of these styles of videos
as someone who loved watching the most extreme as a kid on animal planet i appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly the only thing missing was the music used in the show
dang the fight choreography was so good all the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging the cat noticing the raptor the bluffing the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points

such good work
i didnt realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content incredible work
the animation on this episode is exceptional kudos to kuzim and wobblyworks
ive always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a cg character believable and id say this is proof of that
i love this so much as a big fan of the iconic animal face off series back in the day its nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback awesome stuff as always
the animations here are crazy cool  hoping to see more in the future
this channel has been great the whole time its existed and the skill going into production has been increasing thanks for existing
im a longtime fan of kuzims art and its so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel
wow such a good pilot this gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on tv but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe congratulations to the whole team

i just missed your gaming guide style of writing this one was professional succinct and great but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction
sadly i dont think these videos will hit your normal view count but please dont stop making them the series from this would be amazing and will blow up great job on the animation from your team
at first i was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality fearing they finally dropped the ball on outsides legendary graphics but then i realized this is a user made mod made from scratch not bad at all and a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing would love to see more content in this mod
2 years well spent this is amazing truly top tier content every single time tierzoo just doesnt disappoint

mannn that was so fun your base looks so cool i really hope no one finds it from this video thatd be unfortunate xd
very cool video fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one
rekrap2 just wanted to let you know since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the target block and target fluid on the bottom right since they show exact coords
rekrap2 just letting you know if you want to properly blur your coordinates you also need to blur the chunk coordinates which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks edit after trying to figure out if you gave info away i have found that you did block it sorry
seeing rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
hey rek its amazing to see how much youve grown over the past couple of years form ecocraft to lifesteal then the race to 1m with parrot then to commentary speed runs hoplite and so much other amazing content thank you so much for entertaining me over the years

new ecosystems new creatures a mount that lets you glide from high falls everything from this trailer brought me joy and i absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar
so excited  
this is what i always wanted to see in monster hunter large flocks of animals more ambiant megafauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs

it will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem cant wait to see what they cook up for us
as a fiver it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of monster hunter i am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
ill let it speak for itself is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement you know that monster hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds
the amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster and rath ofc is actually stunning to me didnt think they had it in them
seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment as well as one another has got me feeling the same giddiness i had seeing the monster hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time this franchise is in my blood man
one of my friends got me into mh back when world was announced i played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hours combined later this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time heres to hunting with everyone in 2025 lets go
heres the most anticipated game for me until it comes out very hard to top it from my list 
mhw have such a special place in my gamer heart
this looks amazing it gives me very open worldish vibes i would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting exploring and researching kinda vibe
the little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic
from that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in the synth stuff being used is really new to mh or at least it hasnt had a very large presence they mainly kept to orchestration

but all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme

truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack
mhw was my first introductory into the franchise it became and still remains my favorite game ever and i started at the base nintendo system this game just brought joy to my heart
love the little bit they showed here the movement feels like a mix of worlds more methodical speed and rises more open verticallity
i absolutely loved worlds ecosystem simulation and i absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game
i thought you couldnt get better than the palamutes i was so wrong though the mounts different movement types kinda make me think of koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mounts from scarlet and violet its a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great i love this creature and i want twelve of them
bro when i was going into the game awards i had the lowest of low expectationsbut then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interestedand then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me i am hyped beyond belief even if 2025 is quite a long wait i am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon
i want them to bring back 16 person hubs so much more lively for my 712 person groups it felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world
one of my friends got me into monster hunter my first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cant wait to see what the new game brings 
im reaching that phase in my life where i really dont feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited ",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S,"['hunter take care yourselves all make 2025 and play this amazing game together', 'new ecosystem new creature mount that let you glide from high fall everything from this trailer brought joy and absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this stellar', 'excited', 'this what always wanted see monster hunter large flock animal more ambiant megafauna and large monster type being able encountered hunting pack', '', 'will feel lot more like massive ecosystem cannot wait see what they cook for', 'fiver really surreal experience here for the next generation monster hunter absolutely stoked see what store for', 'ill let speak for itself one the best thing you could say game announcement you know that monster hunter iconic that player could immediately recognize second', 'the amount restraint they had only showing one new large monster and rath course actually stunning did not_ think they had them', 'seeing the way the small monster interact with the environment well one another got feeling the same giddiness had seeing the monster hunter test footage mounting and climbing wall for the first time this franchise blood man', 'one friend got into back when world announced played worldiceborne and risesunbreak 3000 hour combined later this the most exciting announcement for such long time here hunting with everyone 2025 let', 'here the most anticipated game for until come out very hard top from list', 'mhw have such special place gamer heart', 'this look amazing give very open worldish vibe would love see monster hunter move more towards this style that really push the boundary true hunting exploring and researching kind vibe', 'the little bit soundtrack get this trailer just legitimately fantastic', 'from that deep synth bass the start which then punctuated some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral part kicking the synth stuff being used really new least not_ had very large presence they mainly kept orchestration', '', 'but all that leading into what very quickly becoming favorite rendition the proof heroesque leit motif that each game get main theme', '', 'truly excited for this game and hear more soundtrack', 'mhw first introductory into the franchise became and still remains favorite game ever and started the base nintendo system this game just brought joy heart', 'love the little bit they showed here the movement feel like mix world more methodical speed and rise more open verticallity', 'absolutely loved world ecosystem simulation and absolutely cannot wait see what they with this game', 'thought you could not_ get better than the palamutes wrong though the mount different movement type kind make think koraidon and miraidon the pokemon mount from scarlet and violet great concept already and seeing put use beautifully here great love this creature and want twelve them', 'bro when going into the game award had the lowest low expectationsbut then few game trailer came out actually got quite interestedand then this came the very last moment and stole the show for hyped beyond belief even 2025 quite long wait more than willing wait for this masterpiece come soon', 'want them bring back person hub much more lively for 712 person group felt more dynamic and lot fun when had that freedom monster hunter world', 'one friend got into monster hunter first game world and have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since cannot wait see what the new game brings', 'reaching that phase life where really not_ feel like investing much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thoughtso damn excited']",91

haha good on you sweetheart the most genuine thing ive seen on the bbc for 15 years
good to see the bbc becoming more honest in expressing its relationship to the uk
she should be promoted to director general this is the first time i have seen a normal person on the bbc
she should get an oscar for that face change
the drop to absolute deadpan stare is golden
whoever annoyed her behind the scenes long enough to distract her from the countdown to live clock this prize is for you 
a perfect depiction of how the bbc views the british public
finally an amazing and genuine expression on tv thank you
bravo finally some honest downtoearth reporting from bbc news straight from the heart 
this should be at the beginning of every bbc programme hilarious 
that countdown the swear then that drum sound 
its great to see a normal person showing us how she feels the gesture sends a strong message to the viewers if it reached them
dont mess with the staff they got the last laugh 
at least she has a sense of humour and a rebellious spirit
love how she went from genuine to newsreader face in an instant did anyone notice the slight raise of the eyebrow sassy 
its a hilarious amusing and brilliant moment and really made my day 
definitely a private joke between her and the cameraman and she slipped up  actually hilarious

ff7r ps5",3100,"this game is gonna make me shed so many tears and i am so here for it cant wait for february already who else preordered
god that last shot of aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds
cids voice sounds great cant wait to see more of him in this game
the thing im looking forward to the most is the dyne plot line it seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around and barret was already so good in remake
this game is literally the only reason im going to buy a ps5 in the original midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game i cant wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror
aeriths new white dress is so pretty did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral
so excited for this game
props to loren alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game truly magnificent 
so niceeeeee cid and vincent in the party cloud and aerith barrets storythe gold saucer and marlene there with cloud and zack so insane looking forward to playing the second part
im emotional already who knew the impact and trauma ffvii would cause a whole generation
cid was one of my favorite characters in the original ff7 cant wait to play as him again in this remake
i love aerith so much i teared up beautiful song 
i love dynes voice well everyone looks amazing
oh my gosh cloud and aerith just two inches away from each other 
i still have phantom pain from 26 years ago that last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th time
this is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers  and i dont think its going to end the way we suspect  it wont be smiles and rainbows but i dont think aerith is going to die either  if she did then it would beg the question of what this was all for  we know this isnt a true remake but a sequel to the original game  the true remake is ever crisis
quite possibly the greatest game ever made
i nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer im not ready for this i just want to see these characters i grew up with have a happy ending but i know the journey of rebirth wont be an easy one final fantasy for life
nobuo uematsu is truly a legend he just knows how to make music fit the themes of final fantasy games so well cant have final fantasy without nobuo you just cant this song may possibly be the signature theme of ffvii games from now on the ending for ff vii is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this im looking forward to when that day comes

sales from merch will support all life members who opted in",2912,"the leaves are all pointing upwards is a killer quote
etho unknowingly roasting jimmy while hes listening is just pure comedic perfection xd
the cutoff immediately when martin says when is that ender pearl gonna is golden
i think jimmy confused guardian angel with intrusive thoughts personified
joels for the bad boys hurts way more when you consider that he didnt know jimmy was there it was like a moment of them all working together again in a weird little way my heart
grian cleo and etho are like the most wholesome trio that grian had in the entire life series hhahahaha i love it doing that zombie dance without hesitation hahaha
i love how the leaves are all pointing upwards somehow manages to sound so menacing even though it means absolutely nothing
gems little yes when they said the berry bushes got them was so cute the reds this season arent even scary theyre adorable
etho and cleo simply not reacting to grians strangerthannormal behaviour is so based they got this
what ive realized from this video is that jimmy has a brain made for content like the amount of things he did that made this video so many levels of entertaining is genius
them having tasks for the people who died early so they still have funcontent is actually so cute
im super appreciative of the fact that the captions in this video are different colors depending on who is talking thank you
now i kinda wanna see an smp where everyone has a secret spectator buddy
etho and cleo listening to grians weird requests and not thinking or asking twice before doing them for him perfect
jimmys reaction to ethos casual reaction to itsa me was so funny
timmy is forgetting that everyone just embraces the weirdness in this series after 8 episodes
the curse of timmy is contagious he guides grian and grian loses so many hearts turns red and loses even more hearts
crazy how i watched 11 other perspectives and didnt think for a minute that grian was acting weird
the for the bad boys was timed real well with the fact that timmy is guiding grian

just realized paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady  shes basically a drone
i just hope furina gets the well deserved hug that she didnt receive
would be so cool if navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  
furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished love that for her
rip meluse and silver went out as heroes even beyond the grave rest well 
teleporting right to the key in domains is going to be a massive time saver i cant even count how many hundreds of times i did the sprint along the entrance stairs
i love it when sarah hosts the special programs
fontaine enabling a nonhydro related reaction with chevreuse is really an unexpected move
you know historically both france and japan have had influence each other in some point in time especially artistically so seeing inazuma chars in fontaine doesnt surprise me in the least lol

wired is where tomorrow is realized through thoughtprovoking stories and videos wired explores the future of business innovation and culture",926,"thanks again wired more collabs in 2024 
playing against stockfish is like competing in arm wrestling against an industrial press basically
stockfish never fails to put levy in a video
this guy should make his own youtube channel about chess
stockfish be like you missed mate in 54 you filthy casual my suggested move is to never play chess again
it took him 34 moves to lose to stockfish i could do it much faster than that
gothamchess wired  thank you for having me on to talk about computer chess  its been one of my passions for a long time and it was so much fun to discuss with you
so basically the answer to every single question is that stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol
i know he is an im but surviving 35 moves against stockfish is seriously impressive i wish i can survive 35 against my 1000 elo opponents
i love how gms dont even get on this all the less incentive to be one when youre more influential than most gms props gotham
just wait until they hear about mittens
i dont even see the opponents bishop on the opposite side of the diagonal let alone seeing 23 moves into the future
levy builds a youtube career roasting 500 rated bozos
stockfish exists
levy turns out the bozo was me all along

loving the gothamwired collabs
i love when levy appears in a video he didnt upload because the title and thumbnail actually tells you what to expect
this video is so good on so many levels its one thing to discuss the capability of a computer its another thing to be able explain to the common person why this computer is so good and to make the whole explanation so interesting add levys humor and his ability to explain things very well mix that with all that the wired editorial staff can bring to the table and its just wow this content is just friggin awesome thanks all involved
human performs opening move

stockfish after considering half a billion possibilities in a million different realities i will play knight to f6 
to think there was a time when we thought it would be impossible to ever teach a computer to play chess competitively against people  until deep blue beat the best of us
the fact alpha zero made stockfish look silly after only 4 hours of learning chess by playing against itself is both fascinating and scary at the same time
levys so good they can bring him on to interview someone else and the video is still awesome
as someone whos very interested in the world of machine learning and has looked into how stockfish works its cool seeing a video covering the fundamental concepts like this i hope we get more videos like this",24,Entertainment,10800000,PT9M54S,"['thanks again wired more collabs 2024', 'playing against stockfish like competing arm wrestling against industrial press basically', 'stockfish never fails put levy video', 'this guy should make his own youtube channel about chess', 'stockfish like you missed mate you filthy casual suggested move never play chess again', 'took him move lose stockfish could much faster than that', 'gothamchess wired thank you for having talk about computer chess been one passion for long time and much fun discus with you', 'basically the answer every single question that stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol', 'know but surviving move against stockfish seriously impressive wish can survive against 1000 elo opponent', 'love how not_ even get this all the incentive one when you are more influential than most prop gotham', 'just wait until they hear about mitten', 'not_ even see the opponent bishop the opposite side the diagonal let alone seeing move into the future', 'levy build youtube career roasting 500 rated bozo', 'stockfish exists', 'levy turn out the bozo all along', '', 'loving the gothamwired collabs', 'love when levy appears video did not_ upload because the title and thumbnail actually tell you what expect', 'this video good many level one thing discus the capability computer another thing able explain the common person why this computer good and make the whole explanation interesting add levy humor and his ability explain thing very well mix that with all that the wired editorial staff can bring the table and just wow this content just friggin awesome thanks all involved', 'human performs opening move', '', 'stockfish after considering half billion possibility million different reality will play knight', 'think there time when thought would impossible ever teach computer play chess competitively against people until deep blue beat the best', 'the fact alpha zero made stockfish look silly after only hour learning chess playing against itself both fascinating and scary the same time', 'levy good they can bring him interview someone else and the video still awesome', 'someone who very interested the world machine learning and looked into how stockfish work cool seeing video covering the fundamental concept like this hope get more video like this']",594

this video is a perfect example of a classic cool and entertaining jsal video i love it 
jack always manages to be more creative with everyone else
do a part 2 but instead of only changing 5 you change perhaps hundreds and see how that impacts your whole channel it would be so crazy to see your channel get 2x or even more views just by changing title and thumbnails

tyler and bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots they endured sitingstanding in a wall and floor for 3 hours
jt fan favourite the insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though especially when james said how disgusting that would be like whats coming next year hiding in the septic tank
jt hiding in plain sight was awesome
funniest has to be jt and andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while james goofed around with his card trick but tyler and bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure hard to pick between the 2 though
wow lots of good hiding spots this year

its be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in
honestly tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening but tylers had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile
im surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid i was most impressed with jt hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently
someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year
if the hacksmith industries ever move to another building the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property
the insulation hiding spot was 200iq when james pulled out the thermal camera i thought he is not going to find that person with the camera
i love how much team work they put in and i love how often james walked past some people in plain sight lol
jt hiding was the best ive ever seen dude was just sitting there like nobodys business while james was running around legendary
i really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building this is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever
jts hiding spot deserves commendation james was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
this looks like so much fun despite the highpressure work environment and the demands of producing youtube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech yall still manage to bring your a game to hideandseek great job
jt hiding right in front james at the desk was by far the best even though he got caught eventually
i feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings
if i had a nickel for every time i saw a youtube based company playing hide and seek with their employees i would have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened right
jt keeping his cool with james leaning over his shoulder was absolutely the best that said tylers hole in the floor was prolly the most effective spot",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT21M1S,"['sitting just few centimeter away from james insane just hiding plain sight legendary', 'tyler and bogdan definitely had the best hiding spot they endured sitingstanding wall and floor for hour', 'fan favourite the insulation the best hiding spot opinion though especially when james said how disgusting that would like what coming next year hiding the septic tank', 'hiding plain sight awesome', 'funniest and andreas hiding plain sight the office while james goofed around with his card trick but tyler and bogdan had the best hiding spot for sure hard pick between the though', 'wow lot good hiding spot this year', '', 'shame someone secretly spent all year digging hole with trapdoor somewhere hide', 'honestly tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot all bogden cut wall had some form opening but tyler had absolutely telling that altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile', 'surprised that many hid from thermal camera and left little clue where they hid most impressed with hiding plain sight and how long pulled off with eye him frequently', 'someone need incorporate hiding spot project and sit for month just win next year', 'the hacksmith industry ever move another building the next occupant will find unusual amount hidey hole and secret passage throughout the entire property', 'the insulation hiding spot 200iq when james pulled out the thermal camera thought not_ going find that person with the camera', 'love how much team work they put and love how often james walked past some people plain sight lol', 'hiding the best have ever seen dude just sitting there like nobody business while james running around legendary', 'really wish other company understood the importance this kind team building this the kind stuff that make memory and employee will talking about future job about how they used work for the coolest company ever', 'jts hiding spot deserves commendation james stood next him and had goddamn idea', 'this look like much fun despite the highpressure work environment and the demand producing youtube content while simultaneously designing and building some the coolest tech you all still manage bring your game hideandseek great job', 'hiding right front james the desk far the best even though got caught eventually', 'feel like someone who want win this should plan super far ahead build spot early the year that people get used seeing whatever change are made the surroundings', 'had nickel for every time saw youtube based company playing hide and seek with their employee would have two nickel which not_ lot but weird that happened right', 'keeping his cool with james leaning over his shoulder absolutely the best that said tyler hole the floor probably the most effective spot']",1261

follow us on xcomspacex for continued updates on starships progress",2431,"we need these streams back on youtube i need to see this on a large display
so great seeing all 33 raptor engines staying lit during the entire stage 1 ascent excellent work
i really hope you start showing the spacex launches on youtube again their are many many people who dont do social media and miss watching all the falcon launches and updates
great work to all at spacex as always
excited to see spacex making history in our lifetimes
im 67 and i remember the space program from mercury through apollo they used to wheel a tv into the classrooms so we could watchyou cant imagine how thrilled i am to see this happening spacex is just running away with the ball so happy for everyone on the project 
i love this
please bring back live launches to youtube or make a smart tv app for x so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone
this is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and cooperation long live the entire team at spacex 
the length of the flame plume is completely insane starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
it looks almost like an animation the performance of those 33 raptor engines was flawless 
it was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life thank you spacex team
106 the shutdown of the engines in a ring from the outside to the inside pure exhibitionism from spacex a true spectacle
inspiring mom always told me shoot for the stars because youll land on the moon i always think about it when i look up thank you guys for always pushing yourselves it reminds me to do the same
its amazing how close the shot at 053 looks to prior renders of starship both by spacex and by fans
the way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome well done spacex
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the spacex team 3
go for it
this gave me goosebumps i feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future thankyou spacex 
impressive epic view of liftoff the visuals from spacex have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech   looks like spacex is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles
compared to the first test flight this one was like night and day bravo spacex crew ift 3

i lost my wife earlier this year she would have loved this song i shed tears of somberness and loneliness this christmas thank you for releasing this song simon
xg is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained  honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly
what an instant bop for this season
xg brings soul back in music they sing with their heart every word they say every note they sing every choreo there are soulful sincere message in it i hope they keep on doing what they doing they are making the right choice there are a lot of us who understand real music talented artists weve been waiting for a group like you our whole life the fanbase keeps getting bigger i saw new reactors everyday they been saying you are their favorite group so keep going xg hesono ooooo
they really need to play this on radio in all over the us
my great grandpa passed away in october its been really hard for me and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this christmas thanks xg for your amazing new song 
i wish xg would release a full length album with 1314 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts
the gals need some radio play for this song its such a good song and deserves more people to know before christmas
toda vez que escuto novamente meu corao vibra de uma maneira diferente obrigada xg 
i lost my mom this year this song made me think of her since she loved christmas 
the more i listened to the song the more it hit harder also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated christmas for so long because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that this song was so meaningful thank you xg xgalx the creators behind it so much for making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young  and yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 



its sad how underrated this group is
they slayed every genre
not only noisy music and dances
cocos voice so warm and smooth  i can listen to her forever 
jurias make me emotional
mayas and hinatas voices are so pretty im happy they did a lot of singing here
chisa always killing it
jurins and harveys parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time

love them sooo sooo much
i really want to meet the person who produceswrites their stuff it is so authentically american 90s to early 2000s rb its crazy kpop often chases black culture awkwardly but these girls truly pay so much hommage to it in such an authentic way its so amazingly beautiful also harveythat outfit at 333  i cant girl stopplease my heart 
the beauty of the song the amazing vocals the rap production the beautiful harmonies everything is perfect
this song deserves more attention xg is such a talented group theyre better than the most of popular groups
xg is slowly dominating the world really hoping for a live performance

suicidesquad dc rocksteady justiceleague batman superman theflash greenlantern suicidesquadgame",695,"according to all of his girlfriends killed me  the writers room really nailed the interactions amongst characters in the game
cant wait for the batman boss fight even if we dont stand a chance against him
batman you think youre a team now 

loved to hear kevin conroys voice once again rip
initial news about this game has given me doubts but i cant deny that the trailer looks amazing and using gorillaz for the music was unexpected but very welcomed
059 hearing conroys voice again gets me so emotional i cant wait to see his final iconic performance as the dark knight rip
as a gorrilaz and a dc fan i will never feel more satisfied in my life
i dont know whats scarier batman with a gun or batman with fear toxin
the game looks amazing one final ride for kevin conroys batman 
from a story and cinematic aspect this game looks incredible cant say the same for the gameplay but im definitely interested in the campaign
love how some parts of the music sound similar to the flashs cw theme
i know it probably wont happen but i really hope we get aquaman dlc  shazam and mm might be too similar to superman but imagine having a boss arena in atlantis where you have to fight aquaman while holding off sea monsters
time for us bad guys to save the world every badass antihero
the boss battles look amazing especially the one with the flash also gotta love the design for the fear toxin using batman
i thought i couldnt get more hyped for this game
but seeing the boss fights in the trailer i need it nowwwww
gorillaz and suicide squad two of my fave things i never thought would work so well together
god i cant wait for this game the green lantern boss fight looks absolutely sick and this game has won my hype back
ok you got me this time i will give this a chance  fantastic trailer and perfect music
the gameplay doesnt look stellar but the story does its cool that they brought in nightmare batman cant wait to see how that plays out

the fact that all her videos are like movies  the creativity is unmatched  her  her voice  perfect 
in my humble opinion sabrina is the hardest working and most underappreciated female artist out there today  awesome talent as everyone else on here has pointed out  and apparently has been more successful than some of the disney alumni at keeping her head on straight  im always anxious to see what she chooses to do next
this song is pure magic sabrinas vocals are on point and the music video is a visual treat its definitely going to be on my holiday playlist

lyrics 
welcome to my problems
its not an invitation
this is my dilemma
and its my obsession

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

welcome to my nightmare
where dreams go to disappear
sit around in rehab
feeling like a lab rat

strange days are here again
and its getting weirder
heres to all my problems
i just want to drink the poison

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

oh why
when i fall asleep tonight
on the wing
and prayer
oh why
for despair and obsession on you
you yeah

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

i was sober now im drunk again
im in trouble and in love again
i dont want to be a dead man walking
i dont want to be a dead man walking

green day and drop d tuning something i never thought id see but theyve done it and i fucking love it

tcofs dbd",2926,"for people who are confused

this is a brand new single player game set in the dbd universe featuring as far as we know original characters who will likely come to dbd as skins or characters in the future this is made in collaboration with supermassive games who are known to be behind until dawn the quarry and the dark pictures anthology this game will likely be in a style where the player makes choices that will alter the story it will release sometime in 2024

by the way the song is daylight by david kushner
this game has gone so far its insane
it actually looks so good more dead by daylight lore i cant wait
this could be supermassives best game since until dawn well done to both companies im excited  
i love how his helmet is shaped like entitys jaws solid way to reveal more about the character through his design
something about seeing from the world of dead by daylight with solemn music in the background is emotional like for the past 7 years excitement around dead by daylight had always been about what outside thing they brought in like license chapters for the first time hype is generated by someone else announcing that they are collaborating with dead by daylight im also so excited to be able to see dead by daylight in a more cinematic lense finally being able to properly experience the horror of dbd
theres a lot of symbolism in the name the casting of frank stone frank stoke being some form of character casting either being casted by the entity for what we know as the trials or casting in terms of being shaped or molded by the entity as well as casting and stone in the title could imply the saying casting the first stone so this may very well be some form of beginning to the story we know this may have been where the first stone of our story is casted
i like how the killer already looks so unsure about what he wants to do and what hes becoming and when hes shown off in the mask it looks like hes just exhausted and so regretful of whatever deal he made with the entity
you guys have no idea how happy i am to see you two collab together cant wait for this game
if they really want this to feel special i hope we also get to make choices from the killer pov remember that most killers are as much victims of the entity as the survivors and want to escape this purgatory
some hunches i have about this game

1 this could possibly be the first killer that arrived in the entities realm and tells the story about how he got there before being tossed into the void
2 the screams in the background are most likely the four main characters being held captive by said killer who at some point during the game manage to escape and you have to help them make it out alive 
3 the entitys full physical form is seen for the first time that being a gigantic spider while it is said that the realm itself is the entity ex trees birds pallets etc on the official dbd wiki it states that the entities most preferred form is that of a spider resembling something from stephen kings it 
4 its my strong hunch that whoever it is that is supposed to canonically survive the game will most likely show up as a future survivor in the core game 

all in all im really excited for this game cant wait to get my hands on it

edit when i was looking at the steam page for the game i also noticed a pharmaceutical store that had afterpiece tonic on it so well probably get to meet a younger version of the clown at some point or maybe a close relative that refers to him

edit 2 did some thinking and i believe that we will experience the 4 main characters get taken by the entity which will result in them encountering frank stone and we will experience a full trial in a more cinematic perspective this would explain why his workbench is covered in nature by the time the others show up so before that happens its really more so getting to know the towns history and the scars frank left behind
this is an infinitely more interesting collaboration than i thought it was going to be would be super fun to get some outfits or even chapters related to their other games
felt a surprising amount of emotion from this trailer very well made
you can see the reference from the song itself frank doesnt really want to kill but hes being forced by the entity

hiding all of our sins from the daylight  his eyes speaks from the sins he committed such a powerful trailer indeed
im crying seeing how far and how much dead by daylight has grown and i get a shot of nostalgia whenever i play this game
finally expanding the dbd franchise in a way that makes the most sense not everyone likes 4v1s but a lot of people like horror based story games 

imagine new characters or existing characters story fleshed out in an interactive way 

this is a good sign
this has to be one of my favorite trailers you guys have made the music the animation its just great
for anyone wondering what the gameplay and chase sequences will be like

most of the game is cutscenes where you make choices that determine events that happen and who livesdies all action sequences during the game are also cutscenes with things like quick time events for example if you had to jump over a pallet to escape the killer in the game a buttom would appear on the screen if you press the button before it vanishes you jump over the pallet if you dont then the character is either permenantly dead or lives through luck somehow the rest of the gameplay while not being chased will basically be 3rd person and you will just walk around through areas finding clues and trying to escape

also if you want more games like this check out until dawn the quarry and the 4 games in the dark picture anthology
this trailer is a masterpiece this music and this camera optics
perfect music choice i am so in this has to be one of the best directed trailers for anything i have ever seen well done on both companies you guys knocked it out of the

the fact that this is a whole new experience and is free you really gotta give props to epic and lego for this its actually insane
i honestly thought this was going to be just a fun little gimmick for fortnite for a little while but no they clearly put a ton of love and effort into this and the song choice was perfect for the trailer  made me nostalgic for the days i used to play with legos as a kid
not a huge fortnite fan but the devs really put a lot of love and care into their updates wish other developers were the same
might be the best crossover so far
i love that this feels like a callback to the original design of fortnite being a horror survival by night and material base builder by day
i really hope that this is a permanent mode that gets more updates and love from the devs this looks amazing
this is legit what lego worlds should have been
this is pretty epic ngl the effort and care they put into this is really outstanding
this is what we needed we needed a free roam no story lego game im super hyped to play when i get on
i think everyone is truly underestimating the quality of this new game version all the custom skins and animations they had to remake and all the sounds and ideas truly we should thank the developers and not the ones telling them to make it thank you developers
i dont think people understand how much effort this took honestly looks amazing
as a massive lego and lego game fan as well as a fortnite enjoyer i gotta say you guys knocked it outta the park and i love you for it i have been asking for a lego survival for ages little did i know that lego would not deliver but epic would thank you for this
i love how in the end they put adventure is building is a great recall to the battle is building that appears during the first trailer of battle royale
how is there zero paid content for this mode its so insanely good and i was not expecting a completely new game this was awesome
the fact that this is such a new experience and its free that you actually have to give epic and lego props for this is actually crazy
the music alone had me beyond hyped 117 
i played it most of the day around classes and work and it was so much fun i also got to play it with my friends this evening which just made the experience better
after playing this mode for a few hours it feels like a combination of lego universe minecraft and a touch of fortnite i love it
honestly better than what i was expecting just spent the past 5 hours playing with my friends

",1999,"ian wright is a national treasure his and roys friendship is the best part of the whole show
truly respect ian wright for telling that jim cannon story you can see the emotion and it takes a lot of character and bravery to show your vulnerability in front of 800k subs also roy keane showing why hes always been a captain the tap on the arm and saying you got through it top top interaction
ian wright is such a top bloke i enjoy his friendship with roy and with that story at the end roy didnt let it get laughed off or make a glib remark he validated him every dressing room needed a roy keane
ian wright is a national treasure certified 
the chemistry is off the charts the editing too every episode seem to fly by
man that wrighty story at the end got me emotional can only imagine how he might of felt out of place or uncomfortable to start given his late professional start and to have someone treat him like that making him feel unwelcome its enough to make some players never recover to have the career he did shows truly his mental strength and desire love you ian the peoples hero
roy giving ian pats of assurance and comfort is heartwarming to see my captain
wrights gut feeling for bournemouth should have been listened too 
carras reply to pep was tremendous 
my respect for wrighty has grown againnot easy to tell these stories which cannon denies doingian was named palace player of century ahead of cannon which i hope gave him some bit of joy
damn wrighty telling the hard hitting story at the ending no matter what profession your in bullies are everywhere keep sharing these stroies as it makes people stand up and listen
i love the friendship between roy and wrighty its brilliant to watch i seen a comment about ian wright being a national treasure i couldnt agree more with it he really is a national treasure
roy patting wrighty at the end the sense of assurance he still provides more like a captain in his playing days my captain keane every dressing room needs a roy keane 
dont normally comment on these podcasts but i have to say how much i love this 1  4 brilliant ex footballers and great to hear their stories and opinions wrightys story about the bullying he had to put up with at palace was great to hear and see how it affected him but didnt stop him from becoming 1 of arsenal greatest strikers  fair play to him for telling that story and how much it affected him  cant wait for the next one  thank you all
the whole concept off the show is amazing from bitter rivals to best friends could watch them for hours telling their stories amazing 
i love what ian literally brings to the table great personality and top footballer in his day its a great video this so much experience sat together
5014 great shout from wrighty  love the show with just these 4 legends 
i dont usually comment on youtube videos but needed to say how good this show is please keep this lineup also you 4 are a perfect mix

httpvevolybz3tsb",3356,"love that these guys and other bands from this era are still making music keep on rockin 
wow  i love how each single is totally different from each other im at at time in my listening life that the challenges stimulate me in a wonderful way
nica e irrepetible guns n roses forever
sounds heavy and powerful has a spooky vibe i like it 
its different great addition to their catalog the chorus is epic something only gnr could pull off there will never be another
the lyrics are incredible hats off to axl for being this brave i mean it putting all of that into a song must have been unbelievably hard
no generic boring rock song for radio and fans
axl staying true to himself and keep following his vision

great song
i love the lyrics so much theyre hard a lot of people can feel what they mean and find themselves in them myself included i love you guns n roses 
i dont care what anybody says about these guys they are still going strong i saw them in october and they were absolutely awesome im only in high school but they will always be my favourite
there are rock bands and there is guns n roses  legends living legends
msica nova do guns tem que ser comemorada sempre
msica sombria passa um pouco da vibe the garden ficou foda quem tem sensibilidade sente a dor que tem nessa msica
really loving this dark and brooding still my favourite band
this song gives me goosebumps  especially a crazy kind of vibe of walking alone in the rain near bosphorus after a breakup finding yourself in an exotic city istanbul thats sick
superou minhas expectativas
presente universal para o rock
this is definitely one of the songs of all time
i am so impressed for this songi think that gnr could makes a campaign against the childhood abusementthis lyric can help a lot of people that has suffered of abusement

arsenals next 3
aston villa a
brighton h
liverpool a

how many points 
polestar tobs earned the first ever reload props for that 
that was a cooking masterclass from saeed then grizz had to get in on the act and had me dying for a good 40 mins this is big 6ix heritage where cookings are a thing of beauty 
love how when saeed started to run out of ammo blasting chelsea grizz came in with some resupply like  there was a missed penalty in there as well yeaa bare missed chances said gallaghers their best player 
this show was 1010 that intro saeed cooking matisse in a deep fryer the top 3 rivalry at the top starting to simmer loved it
i look forward to this the highlight of my week just chatting football i just finished my physiotherapy after a double leg break car accident my community man repping liverpool

edit
10800 and saeed did a saeed again
the artwork within that intro was so intricate st is a genius  with the edits appreciate this brudda for as long as you have him
saeed is good in taking the banter but also giving it 
big up the lads for the late show quality content always 
when saeed is giddy and united win its honestly one of the most hilarious things to watch 
been a really bad week for me this week but you guys have made me laugh both shows this week have put a smile on my face when i didnt think it possible much appreciated
ive always said mc arent as great as theyre made out to be lp  spurs showed everyone the last few yrs when teams dont fear them  attack them they look beatable  will concede goals but none of the other teams copied it too many teams feared them sat back expecting to get beat which made mc look better than they were
fantastic show guys as always love the content and the banter is always top 
nah man i had to comment we aint seen citeh struggling quite like this tbh especially the way they were totally dominated by villa fair play to unai emery man deserves respect  talking about the episode tho yet another banger this title race gonna be super lit 
love the show guys top banter and top people 
the intro has to be one of the best so far the tobi part   skull doing madness on these introes would love to maybe integrate facecams to see all of your reactions to seing the intro for the first time if possible  love from norway
i find it crazy how some chelsea fans are doubting poch after 4 months yes he has spent but he has also sold a lot of those players are not his  poch is a project manager so you have to give him time with building his own squad 

chelsea fans need to remember this isnt roman anymore sacking managers so quickly might not be so smart under these owners esp when you look at the lack of top managers out their now

the editing of these video never fails to make me laugh the graphic blocking jays face is just top tier metahumor

hey guys i admire your videos but you should reconsider which sponsors you take as betterhelp has had its good share of controversies including but not limited to
 selling personal data of its users
 predatory charging methods
 its workers being of questionable quality with some of them being unlicensed psychologists and some reportedly just saying people to get over it
isnt betterhelp the company that was found pressuring its vulnerable clients into giving up sensitive data and then sharing that data with third parties illegally so bad that the ftc had to step in
it has been brought to my attention that what i said is very much outdated info that is no longer true to whoever might read this please disregard this comment




original comment for context

i always thought it was really annoying that here in argentina the rules dont allow us to register ar domains instead only comar and netar being available because ar is the most common ending for verbs in infinitive form in spanish so it would be a goldmine of word play
betterhelp is a company that has many egregious practices that are detrimental to mental health support
given how crazy for the usa so many of my fellow stateside people are its kind of wild that theres not a patriotismfueled rush to not just use but overuse the us code
hi both love the video but its worth researching better help a bit more  they are notoriously sketchy not only are they dodgy about whether therapists are vetted or not but also they have sold incredibly personal consumer data lots of articles online about this recently because they were found guilty there are also some great video essays about bh and how they arent quite what they seem just letting you know if it informs future decisions
actually  dot cat is not some random cat loving persons idea its the marker for catalan speaking or catalan related websites thats why joke websites and cat related businesses often have the option to view the site in catalan as its a requirement to keep using the cat extension
that youtubers still take betterhelp sponsorships after everything that happened is a damn shame
one funny thing i learned a few years ago the french antarctic territories have their own domain tf but its mosrly used for websites centred around the video game team fortress 2 id never really thought thered be an actual part of the world that was meant to be using it
fun fact before dns domains were managed by one woman and her team whod create the hosts file and then everyone just had to make sure they had the latest hostsfile
i think its interesting to mention that some countries using an alphabet other than the latin get a bonus cctld in their local alphabet for example in greece there are gr and  although almost nobody uses  because it was recently added and people are used to gr also in the eu there are  and  the greek and cyrillic equivalents to eu beacuse official languages of the union use these alphabets
the united states of america considers itself the default country
truer words have not been spoken
i normally have to watch map men videos a few times looking for those little extras they put in

even the unfinished london videos were full of them

well played jay mark and the rest of any team you have helping you
i laughed so hard at the new zealand having six flags on the whatismyflag website at the start i really appreciate that our flag fiasco gets to be a joke on this channel because it was a joke when it happened as well anyway i still think the laser kiwi flag shouldve won
as always i found this to be quite an informative and entertaining video i learned about two islands today torquay is a small town on the coast of england while the even smaller tokelau which surprisingly i have heard of has or had the most popular internet country code despite not even being a country but part of new zealand 

thanks for the video

kierans new character design mixed with the music was really well done
im excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around paldea hope theyre not shiny locked and you can finally get shiny sword  shield legendaries
152 i love how when the player character sends out ionos magnemite she sends the pokeball the way iono does thats a nice detail
everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary pokemon but im just glad we get to see more larry
honestly it feels like teal mask walked so that indigo disk could run looking forward to this one
350 not only am i glad darkrai is getting the attention he deserves but also challenging dialga and palkia with darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie
yes blastoise 3d model is finally fixed ive been wanting this for over 10 years his face is sculpted proper his cannons are the correct size and his shell white trim is now sculpted properly hoohs new model also looks nice
the fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries  not only does its lore look interesting but we are finally getting the majestic minogame pokemon that ive been wanting since squirtlewartortle didnt evolve into one
gen 9 isnt even over yet and im already nostalgic for it and ive been a pokemon fan since the beginning
im so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there the music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement
i love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders can we have the team star members back as well love those guys
this dlc has been amazing so far its been personally heartwarming to see familiar pokmon return and have new places to explore
im so freaking happy all the starters are coming back cant wait to find a popplio
i dont often comment on youtube videosbut im extremely excited for this one get to bring back some of my favourite pokmon i collected over the years to join me in this dlc im also excited for new pokmon to catch and explore this new area been playing since 2006 when i was 14 amazing that how pokmon games have come along the way
i hope that the catch rate for legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown paradox entei and paradox terrakion
theres so much about this trailer that im really happy about i am hyped cant wait for this to come out
one thing i seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing 

and oh man keiran looks like hes changed quite a lot i guess well have to see if theres a way to save him but it looks like hes gone villain mode or maybs just angsty rival mode

still its gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again and how the story is going to play out i mean getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too never even expected them to pull off a dialga and palkia tera raid much less give out a darkrai even though you can get one in legends arceus or bdsp if you managed to the members card last year

still all these new things are amazing

im obsessed with how passionate they are about explaining everything the little details they were sharing as if theyve been waiting forever to tell us it keeps me so interested in the video knowing that they love what they do
this is the prime example that billie doesnt just whisper and use autotune she can sing for real and its amazing
i love hearing billie and finneas talk about production unless youve produced or studied it in some way youll never know the full extent of what goes into production and im so glad they did this interview to show people that its not just a few instruments and vocals its way more than that 
billies vocal is so angelic i mean the way she sings that same lyric with different melodies is just so beautiful to hear
they are legendary duo they are gonna be in history pages as legends love them
now im convinced that billie can sing anything at any style
like the audacity to say it was hard the whole time then randomly sings it perfectly
such a powerful duo in the music industry their writing process is always so genuine and interesting to me what was i made for is truly a heartfelt song i love how they have so much fun with some songs they write but some of them they get down and serious they know when there is a time and place to do both of those things during the process of making a song
these two are definitely geniuses listen to how they talk about how they feel about music and how they write it
i feel like being in your 20s is like such a overwhelming thing where you ask yourself everyday who you are what you are made for and what youre gonna do with your life seeing that billie who is such a phenomenon and a deeply talented person goes through the same thing is so wild and reassuring i love them both so much and their music means so much to me just loved it
i love how confident billie is now about being able to play her voice like an instrument
i love how when she wrote this song she wrote it for a character but she also relates to it in her personal life this song broke my entire heart it is so sad yet so beautiful her and finneas always make hits they truly are one of the best music duos
billies vocal choice was spot on for an emotional piece like this shes like a cloud singing for the sun 
2 words to describe these two and it still undermines their artistic ability musical geniuses
people neglect fin too much his mindset is so interesting and so much less obscure then a regular mind hes such a musical genius when it comes to producing and lyric writing
i like how finneas makes it sounds like a minimal instrumental but there are so many layers into it such an amazing production
now thats what i call an interview a professional interview we dont need to know their personal lives give us more of this
i get frustrated when people say billies music is basicfor teenagersoverrated because they dont see this side of her and finneas theyre one of my most favorite musicians bc of how brilliant they are behind the scenes",24,Entertainment,4180000,PT18M35S,"['this why musician should only give interview about their music opposed the endless interview about their personal life have not_ seen billie this animated and relaxed and happy during interview long time', 'wild that billie can just randomly sing thing that she say are hard lol she like this super hard and then just doe perfectly', 'love how finneas such musical genius while billie sings effortlessly such perfect dynamic duo', 'obsessed with how passionate they are about explaining everything the little detail they were sharing they have been waiting forever tell keep interested the video knowing that they love what they', 'this the prime example that billie doe not_ just whisper and use autotune she can sing for real and amazing', 'love hearing billie and finneas talk about production unless you have produced studied some way you will never know the full extent what into production and glad they did this interview show people that not_ just few instrument and vocal way more than that', 'billy vocal angelic mean the way she sings that same lyric with different melody just beautiful hear', 'they are legendary duo they are going history page legend love them', 'now convinced that billie can sing anything any style', 'like the audacity say hard the whole time then randomly sings perfectly', 'such powerful duo the music industry their writing process always genuine and interesting what made for truly heartfelt song love how they have much fun with some song they write but some them they get down and serious they know when there time and place both those thing during the process making song', 'these two are definitely genius listen how they talk about how they feel about music and how they write', 'feel like being your like such overwhelming thing where you ask yourself everyday who you are what you are made for and what you are going with your life seeing that billie who such phenomenon and deeply talented person through the same thing wild and reassuring love them both much and their music mean much just loved', 'love how confident billie now about being able play her voice like instrument', 'love how when she wrote this song she wrote for character but she also relates her personal life this song broke entire heart sad yet beautiful her and finneas always make hit they truly are one the best music duo', 'billy vocal choice spot for emotional piece like this she like cloud singing for the sun', 'word describe these two and still undermines their artistic ability musical genius', 'people neglect fin too much his mindset interesting and much obscure then regular mind such musical genius when come producing and lyric writing', 'like how finneas make sound like minimal instrumental but there are many layer into such amazing production', 'now that what call interview professional interview not_ need know their personal life give more this', 'get frustrated when people say billy music basicfor teenagersoverrated because they not_ see this side her and finneas they are one most favorite musician because how brilliant they are behind the scene']",1115

the room is better with you in it one of the greatest compliments ever given
they are both so articulate in their language its incredible ive never seen such an academic yet warm and wholesome interaction from both sides
emily blunt and anne hathaway need their own podcast i would listen to them all the time
anne hathaway really watched oppenheimer like observing all the cuts directions and dialogues love how she knows her game and is a big appreciative of good work that makes her an amazing actress
emily is such an honest complimentor you can just tell she means every word and emotion every time she gives anne compliments about her work and just her personal character in general shes such a girls girl they both are also this pairing is varietys best one yet they very much ate with this
anne is incredible so intelligent in touch and aware she is rare
i wholeheartedly agree with emily complimenting anne for being so eloquent and articulate throughout the interview i felt that shes really thought and dissected their work and is not just spouting empty praises for the cameras benefit her sincerity shines through ugh love these two
the conversation was so fluid and genuine laughs seriousness praise shared experiences it was like a window into two friends having brunch brilliant
i know this might be more of a conversation than an interview but damn this episode along with the previous two of cillianmargot and downeyruffalo have made me believe that actors on a similar level or playing stage are the best interviewers of each other so much insight and quality dialogue packed into a very entertaining video
these actors on actors episodes are so good that you can watch it in one go and not get bored once
this was such an interesting and high level conversation between friends who love each other and colleagues that absolutely respect each other theyre both so eloquent classy and inteligent ugh just amazing
anne hathaway is aging sooooooo beautifully i cant believe how much time has passed since i first watched the princess diaries for the first time this was such a great conversation i cant believe the video passed so fast i could listen to them talk for hours
its actually sooo nice to see two ladies bond over work that they both admire and worked on together even fangirling abtover each other their energy and love for one another made me smile ear to ear from start to finish the chemistry the way they bounce off eo and finish eos sentences is so cute the sisterfriendship these two have is so beautiful and so pure 3
whoever pitched the idea for the last 3 episodes seriously need a raise what a perfect timing too nearing holiday season
this interview was absolutely incredible hearing them both complimenting not only each other but nearly everyone theyve worked with on set was just wow
how refreshing to see two people talking to eachother with such dignity kindness and sincere affection
emily was just amazing in oppenheimer i completely loved her her acting was superb

the meaning of life
so bold atlus so bold never thought youd be this direct when marketing this game
every trailer just gets me more hyped for this game
i think i was able to start living because of the time i spent with my friends
 makoto yuki persona 3 winter of rebirth

edit to me hell always be minato arisato 
really looking forward to doing akinaris social link again his social link was the most meaningful and important social link in the entire game
cmon bro i almost teared up at junpeis voice line zeno really about to make me cry
every new teaser keeps getting me more and more excited for this game to drop the animation is just incredible and beautiful i cant wait 
aleks le absolutely killed it with that gutwrenching scream at 106 it really does sound like how getting your psyche physically ripped apart would probably feel  rly excited to see his performance as a couple other characters too hes such a talented va
is this the opening theme man the reload originals just dont miss that second half feels straight up like a battle theme
bebe sounds way more badass than i expected him to loving all the social link voices so great to finally hear them even kenji seems more likable just from his voice acting
my life has meaning once again when you remake the game thank you team atlus
that amazing song with all those shots of the crew and akinari talking about the meaning of life actually made me tear up well played atlus
already more than excited to play reload and if the song used in this trailer is in its opening thatll be amazing also love the fact lucien dodge is akinari dudes a fantastic voice actor so it great he gets to voice my favorite social link from the original p3
the opening song is a banger man
all the social links feel even more alive junpei and akinaris lines are beautifully done and the armageddon fusion spell at the end man this 2024 is looking like a great year for gaming
i just realized that every character being voiced means the sun confidant is included
122 made me instantly tear up
im so glad every persona soundtrack comes with a game inside
that one line from zeno as junpei has fully cemented that he has what it takes 

junpei has this strange gentleness in his voice that i was afraid was going to get lost in the wackiness but no he definitely hit a home run
106 and 117 really gave me goosebumps phenomenal voice acting from aleks lee and zeno robinson

man your dad is oviously having the time of his life he is probably the proudest dad this side of the atlantic cherish the time you spend with him really touching to see him smile from the bottom of his heart
even if the car was fully functional it wouldnt go into gear if the front latch is unlashed common issue with the mclaren if you want to bypass this issue  keep the brake pedal fully depressed and hold the drive d selector for 20 sec and it would shift to 1st gear allowing you to move
well that was a bit unexpected but still need to beat hammond
no matter how bad a situation is mats dad is always laughing thats so inspiring i like this man sooooo much
its upsetting when things dont go to plan for mat were all rooting for you man
for me as a mclaren technician it is very interesting but kind of a pain to watch you rebuild or try to rebuild the car theres so much i would love to tell you how to do different or where you forgot to put in screws or bolted something in the wrong way just for example looks like you forgot the screw of the last interior part from behind but anyways i will keep watching and just hope you will get it running again try holding down d button when engine is running for around 10 seconds works wonders sometimes
mat it is always entertaining without being stupid like some other youtubers you are a hands on problem solver like a lot of us which is refreshing looking forward to the journey
your explanation of how the suspension works was amazing this is your best video yet mat cheers
looks like the oil drains on the turbos might be kinked or not positioned correctly youll smoke like that at idle and free revving since the oil has no where to go and it just goes through the seals good luck
i work for mclaren as a technician if you fill all 8l into the engine in one go during an oil change it will overflow internally and cause a smoke show start with 65l then run it and go through the top up procedure
i love how matts dad has such a positive vibe even in the bad moments
youll get it worked out mat we have faith in you keep up the amazing content my man
i reckon by now mat must be the nations best qualified luxury sports car mechanic these things are so complex but he and his dad and team always take it in their stride inspiring and remarkable
way to go mat and team on getting it this far looks like another engine to take out and fix you got this 
i absolutely enjoy every video you guys do  it feels like i am right along there with you  i enjoy the great attitude you all have and the ability to have fun no matter what  even if it costs money  lol
man you can see the dissappointment on his face he really wants this done good luck man absolutely awesome of a series

weve got our hands on the allnew tesla cybertruck and its lining up alongside the a lamborghini urus but which will come out on top  petrol or electric 

well lets check out the stats starting with the cybertruck it rolls up equipped with three electric motors and they combine to produce 845hp and 930nm of torque the starting price of the dualmotor edition is around 49000 but for this trimotor cyberbeast edition itll cost you around 96000 in terms of weight the cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes it also has a top speed of 130mph 

then we have the lambo its packing a 4litre twinturbo v8 under the bonnet and this can produce 650hp and 850nm of torque power is sent to all four wheels via an 8speed torque converter gearbox and its a whole lot lighter than the tesla tipping the scales at 2200kg it also has a much bigger top speed coming in at 190mph 

so the cybertruck has the urus beat when it comes to performance stats but will the extra weight drag it down theres only one way to find out for sure lets race",10243,"what has the world come to a lamborghini losing a race to a polygon
obviously the cybertruck has lesser polygons and so it render and thus runs faster
one could imagine how much it breaks yannis heart to see the urus lose like that
cyber truck is a beast but the everyday people wont be able to afford it
a refrigerator that goes from 0 to 60 in 26 secondsnow thats fast food

to see something so big moving so fast is just insane
gutted i was not there for this
its often easy to know which car wins even before they race 98 of the time its the car matt is driving 
you can imagine how sad yanni was when he saw the urus team losing the game like this
its easy to predict which car will win in your drag races mat  it is always the car you are driving 
i noticed in the last video and in this one too that the cybertruck appears to have a slow start in the first 18 to 14 second to prevent any wheel spin then the full power is applied once the tires are connectedand from that point it just goes
i wonder if matt will ever be allowed to use a pagani for anything even just a review or something would be amazing to see i think hed have a great time with something like that
it has great design and amazing new technologies
matthew likes the idea of winning he has to be in a faster vehicle even if they swap cars he has to go back to the faster one
i wish i could be one of the construction workers there on lunch break watching you guys race i am sure they are placing bets out there
710 looks like uris is still rolling at 30mph the contrast in acceleration is incredible

mastersoftheair trailer appletv",1168,"i wish my dad was still alive to see this he was a pilot of a b24 liberator in the 93rd bomb group of the 8th air force stationed at hardwick  airfield in norfolk england
band of brothers and the pacific are both incredible i expect nothing less for this one too
the level of production in appletv is amazing looks like a movie
i supervised the cg environments on this show and lots of people worked until they were fully drained to make it look this good was an honor to pay tribute to those who gave their lives for us to be here today this is a masterpiece indeed cheers  enjoy
while everyone is waiting for this to air i recommend reading the book which the series is based on masters of the air by donald miller it is excellent
now that is a trailer band of brothers and the pacific are absolute masterpieces two of the best series i have ever ever seen ive even read the books truly cannot wait for this
ive watched and rewatched band of brothers an almost embarrassing number of times  bring on masters of air
the predecessor shows before this one by hanks and spielberg are second to none this looks exceptional and will give the authentic look into the courage of the mighty eighth based on a phenomenal book masters of the air i fully expect this to be epic
so hyped on this my grandad was a b17 tail gunner flew over on dday was shot down twice and survived thank you for telling their story
my grandpa a pilot in the 491st his b24 was shot down after 23 missions he used the talk of the flak with a quivering voice 
he was the bravest man i ever knew when i wanted to join the military he asked me not to it changed me he said you see things you cant unsee and do things you cannot undo 
i thank god for all those who served and serve and do those things that cannot be undone and see the things that cannot be unseen so others dont have to
read the book for the second time this summer it is a masterpiece while the trailer looks nice and flashy there is here a sort of veil of romance and bravado that is not felt in the book the book is blood and guts and normal if you can can people that crawl into a ball turret normal people doing incredible things as others have mentioned i hope they are not losing the grip on what made the pacific private ryan and  especially band of brothers great the grounded uncensored grim and realistic look feel and sound i think i heard something the hanks even commented that he wanted a grimmer tone for masters of the air more on par with das boot for this one and i am not quite feeling it from this trailer this feels very hollywood in all aspects pretty girl back home slow motion explosions sunsets everywhererest assured i will still watch it do death i just hope they do the source material justice in all its brutality and grit
looks really stunning  it feels like a movie  the cinematography looks awesome and the scope is so big  i cant wait to watch this series  is going to be a big hit  
i live nearby a cemetery where hundreds of american and british pilots are buried who died while flying over holland most of these boys were hardly over 20 years old every now and then ill pay them a visit to show respect for all the men and boys who died fighting the greatest evil of all time this series looks amazing btw
i teared up watching this trailer ive been waiting for this to come out ever since it was announced as a thing

my grandfather served as a bombardier in the 8th air forcethe very group this is about although not in the units portrayed as far as i can tellin the war and was shot down on his 30th and last mission just days before dday he spent much of the rest of the war imprisoned in stalug luft iiiescaping twice staying free the second timebefore being liberated by troops under the command of general patton himself seeing something like this brought to the screen with this much amazing work put into it is something ive wanted to see in some way for the longest time having only read his story in his unpublished memoir he died seven years before i was born after a life that could only be described as epic 

now his story or what will likely be as close as itll get to one portrayed onscreen is finally coming and from no less than the people who made band of brothers and the pacific to say im stoked is an understatement
this trailer is very polished looking i hope they havent abandoned the gritty realism and harsh tone that in my book is what made band of brothers and the pacific the timeless classics that they are there is a reason those two series are timeless while wwii films like unbroken and red tails or the recent greyhound with tom hanks on apple tv arent  its the manufactured smaltz factor that the latter have i think butler is a fine actor but i hope hes not overemoting this entire series like it comes across in the trailer
my father was a ww2 lancaster pilot in the elite pathfinder section of raf bomber command he would have loved this tribute to his us brothers in arms rip dad
my late father was a ww2 vet drafted into the army at 18 hadnt even graduated from high school yet ended up in pattons 3rd army 90th infantry division during the battle of the bulge wounded once walked into the flosenberg concentration camp at 18 years old  how could you process that i love you dad you were the best dad a man could ask for
looks very gorgeous the scope is enormous the cinematography is amazing and it has the sense of a movie im eager to see this television show is going to be very popular

im glad to see google back in the game this looks next level
very impressive want to try it
fyi this is embellished a bit its still extremely cool and impressive and i am so excited to see these advances but theres a fair amount they have to do to get to this exact state in a viral video demonstrating geminis capabilities google took significant artistic license it showed a user speaking with gemini but was actually representing a text conversation it showed a moving video but was feeding gemini still images it showed fast responses but sped those up it showed tight model outputs but shortened them for brevity it showed brief prompts eliciting terrific answers but listed longer prompts in a blog post  from big technlology by alex kantrowitz
the realtime element is by far the most impressive these sorts of asynchronous interactions are what ai has been missing thus far
just one problem the video isnt real we created the demo by capturing footage in order to test geminis capabilities on a wide range of challenges then we prompted gemini using still image frames from the footage and prompting via text parmy olsen at bloomberg was the first to report the discrepancy
that is incredibly impressive there were clearly some hidden prompts as it kept understanding switching contexts but still it was highly impressive
im just looking forward to when they hook up this kind of ai into one of those boston dynamics robots and we can finally have robot servants we can talk to like we always dreamed of in scifi it increasingly feels like we are finally living in the future like we expected we would by the year 2000
when this is really working as being shown it is indeed mindblowing great job
cant wait to try itwith all the understanding this model is able to do its just amazing
very impressive i didnt expect this kind of thing so early it just has been a year since ai war started and we come this far
unfortunately what you see is not at all what happened the ai does not actually reply to the person but to a script and pictures containing sometimes more information than we are shown here
wow gemini is incredibly impressive the combination of multimodal capabilities and its ability to interact with different formats like text images and even code is truly groundbreaking i especially loved the showcase of visual puzzles and image  text generation this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with ai and open up new possibilities for learning and creative expression
its truly fascinating to see what ai is now capable of
this is incredible now if we can combine this with an embodied agent that can navigate through the world plan out sequences of actions from interactions with the user and use rl to learn from mistakes and learn about the user that would be gg
i cant imagine the amount of data used to train gemini this is next level and if it has open ais new voice type then this will be the greatest multimodal ai
its kinda crazy how intelligent this ai is on the fly and is considered a basic model by them the stuff they have behind the scenes is far more advanced
i find this mindblowing although what im more exited about what is going to happen next for the past year openai has been without competition so they have probably not been in full gear now that google and openai have caught on it sure to mean an ai race is going to start with a ridicolous speed of progress
fascinating  i cant wait to see what weve accomplished in another 5 years

szoboszlai has perfect balance on the ball
the way nunez passed the ball should be the model how the teammates should serve him
the calmness and finishing skills of szoboszlai are insane
nuezs work ethic and dedication will always get him a starting place in any team
the save by kelleher was very important it kept the game 00 at that time
the balance and power from szoboslai is insane
first goal by captain virgil always made to look cool by him darwin nunez made a strikers tackle to win the ball and assist for the second goal by dominik szoboszlai is worth a good mention here the blades did not play badly as the game was entertaining enough luck however always wins the game

congratulations to sheffield for putting up a great fight and never giving up they gave lfc a real game today and i think they will be be okay to stay in the pl if they keep up that sort of attitude good win for us all the same on to palace next not gonna be easy either ynwa
give the commentator credit
think he did a cracking job 
better than a lot of todays on sky
i am a sheffield fan but that nunez press was sick ngl about szobo you know what to expect from him with all that space
amazing soft touch to cushion the ball  balance and calmness very noticeable finish was  superb i dont know this player but his technique is eyecatching  and pleasing to watch  liverpool are fortunate to have aquired such a player as szoboslai 
van djik scores as a forward
good play by sheffield every match in premier league can be unpredictable
well played blades liverpool fans have a real soft spot for chris wilder top bloke hope you stay up
it ends everything when van dijk comes around  106

this was an unexpected turn for the schedule but i would genuinely feel bad not screaming out the black parade exists
the absolute best line from the faq in the docs for this custom campaign

q are you guys fans of my chemical romance
a no this is what happens when you think you have a cool name and dont google it beforehand
i love the thief video series the game is two decades old but it is one of the most creative and fun retro games you can play
damn this mod looks amazing it fills my heart knowing theres a dedicated group of old thief fans like myself making love letters to this legendary trilogy the scale of the maps is unreal and i wanna get lost in them snagging loot cant wait to play this
you know smth is gonna be good when mandalore resurrects the mod spotlight series to talk about it

seriously though would love to see you cover more mods on games
this man will do absolutely anything to avoid making the thief 4 video
i was given the honor of betatesting this absolute behemoth and all i can say to my fellow thief fans is go play it if you want to experience thief as if it was the first time
1123 what are you so frightened of come to me
it was seriously a privilege to have gotten to do voicework and later betatest this beast i will forever be in awe of the dedication and craft of the team hope you enjoyed my contribution and may the city never die
i can only imagine how proud someone must be who as a creator made a game with the technology they had available at the time and then 25 years later the fans of that which you have created have been compelled enough to carry forward and expand upon your work with this scale
blessed be the mod makers i salute you all for your community service if only you could create as much as you wish hopefully the artists wont starve some day
every time thief content reaches broad audience it feels like something to celebrate
how crazy is this the mod solidifies lore from multiple games i would love for all companies to take so much care of their ips make them deeper fix problems etc this mod should be a template for all sequels 

i think gaming lost a lot when the concept of expansions died the same engine more missions more lore just more this mod is clear proof how much value this concept can add without pushing the games technology too much further
once again mandy proves to be the saviour of the broken defeated and the damned and also signalboosting one of the coolest things to come out of the modding scene this year

i should really get into this after arcane dimensions and also wizordum
it was a privilege to be able to contribute to this its truly a landmark in the thief community and all the new developments on display are going to be a real game changer the same way thief 2x was all the way back in 2005
daily reminder that everyone should check out the dark mod its an standalone total conversion of doom 3 thats thief but legally distinct and it has an active community of thief veterans that make missions throughout the year for a free fan game its an impressive testament of how passionate the thief modding community is even when the franchise is dead
i always love to see thief fan missions represented there are a ton of extremely high quality levels im like 3 levels into this one and its fantastic always love to see lady rowena represented after her passing she was a sublime map maker

eazyspeezy cuphead speedrun",776,"this is a certified i tried 100 speedrunning cuphead moment
to think that the devs had to sell their own house at one point to finish the game
the game flopping would have been terrifying
this man has professionalism in 70 of the entirety of video games
3710 its surprising how few people know that the parry hitboxes for king dices cards are extended upward if you are playing as chalice however the fight against hopus pocus the rabbit is almost impossible to complete without taking damage so cuphead is still optimal for this level
the fact that he called cagney flowey without acknowledging it is too funny
here she turns into a sausage and tries to attack us with her swirling meat attacks  while we also have to deal with a bunch of dangling meats
how did you get past the first level so fast i saw a professional video game journalist spend 25 minutes on it because of its difficulty
while i have 300 the game im definitely not mad enough to try speed running it yet respect
there are several reasons im terrible at cuphead but one of them is that i get distracted wanting to watch the brilliant animations
if you play the circus run and gun level you van dodge roll through the stack of minions if u stand on the top platform just roll jump and dash to the next platform that you you dont have to shoot them and safe time 
it also works on the cannons at the end at that section
this game is just amazing for many reasons and i would love to see it more on this channel
the divine relic is actually perfect for the devil on his second phase you can spam your whetstone to deal a ton of damage and kill him insanely quickly
cuphead is so unique in like every aspect i love it
even though i have s ranked every boss in the game i will definitely not speedrun the game like you mad respect there were even things i didnt know you showed in your speedrun like mortimer freezes final phase has no hitbox damn
i never knew that not attacking the onion was a viable option
for those who dont know if u leave the dogs alive but damage their jetpacks when the jetpacks spray gray smoke instead of white smoke then the fight becomes slightly easier because the robot dog wont flip the screen upside down
im so sad that speed runs take so long to do because i could watch your videos every day all the time  theyre so good
this is the most beautiful game ever made and i dont see it getting beaten any time soon ill take a unique and amazingly creative artstyle like this over photorealistic graphics any day
this is easily top 3 favourite games of all time such a unique game and every level is a boss apart from run n guns absolutely love it
for ribby  croaks you can use converge because it pierces through hitboxes so you can do double damage to them",20,Gaming,2750000,PT38M41S,"['this certified tried 100 speedrunning cuphead moment', 'think that the devs had sell their own house one point finish the game', 'the game flopping would have been terrifying', 'this man professionalism the entirety video game', '3710 surprising how few people know that the parry hitboxes for king dice card are extended upward you are playing chalice however the fight against hopus pocus the rabbit almost impossible complete without taking damage cuphead still optimal for this level', 'the fact that called cagney flowey without acknowledging too funny', 'here she turn into sausage and try attack with her swirling meat attack while also have deal with bunch dangling meat', 'how did you get past the first level fast saw professional video game journalist spend minute because difficulty', 'while have 300 the game definitely not_ mad enough try speed running yet respect', 'there are several reason terrible cuphead but one them that get distracted wanting watch the brilliant animation', 'you play the circus run and gun level you van dodge roll through the stack minion you stand the top platform just roll jump and dash the next platform that you you not_ have shoot them and safe time', 'also work the cannon the end that section', 'this game just amazing for many reason and would love see more this channel', 'the divine relic actually perfect for the devil his second phase you can spam your whetstone deal ton damage and kill him insanely quickly', 'cuphead unique like every aspect love', 'even though have ranked every bos the game will definitely not_ speedrun the game like you mad respect there were even thing did not_ know you showed your speedrun like mortimer freeze final phase hitbox damn', 'never knew that not_ attacking the onion viable option', 'for those who not_ know you leave the dog alive but damage their jetpacks when the jetpacks spray gray smoke instead white smoke then the fight becomes slightly easier because the robot dog will not_ flip the screen upside down', 'sad that speed run take long because could watch your video every day all the time they are good', 'this the most beautiful game ever made and not_ see getting beaten any time soon ill take unique and amazingly creative artstyle like this over photorealistic graphic any day', 'this easily top favourite game all time such unique game and every level bos apart from run gun absolutely love', 'for ribby croak you can use converge because pierce through hitboxes you can double damage them']",2321

the person who paired them up deserves a raise
its so rare to see cillian murphy enjoying an interview and i am all in for it
apparently it was cillians team that reached out to variety asking for the pairing and i find that super wholesome
audiences dont like being told you should see this or you should see that they will decide and they will generate the interest themselves  such a brilliant quote
cillian doesnt look like he hates life in this how delightful it is to see him smile and laugh through the conversation he initiated this pairing and wanted to be there please give him more chances to make his own choices the result is seeing him truly happy to engage with someone
can we take a moment to appreciate that the producers even matched the microphones to the outfits 
it feels so good to see a fulllengthconversationalinterview being given by cilian could totally relate with margot when she started talking and asking questions about peaky blinders 
i love how he just ask her questions and keeps her talking as a fellow introvert what a classic move
yall the way i was devouring every single bit of cillians talking only the fans know how precious is having him speaking so lightly and for such a long time that man never shows up anywhere he doesnt have social media its a suffering to love him
margot is a masterclass on how to combine beauty and brains her insights on being a producer are so interesting as she was involved in the entire process from day one
i love how margot doesnt let cillian get away with his modest attitude and really grills him in a charming way on subjects like his apparent unawareness of the memes and the reasons why nolan loves to work with him

you can really sense that shes 100 authentic and doesnt shy away from confidently stating that she knew that the movie was going to be a hit and that her performance was influential in convincing matell
it brought so much joy to watch these two discovering each others role so natural and calm energy and its so amazing to see them being engaged to their characters
i just love how natural cillian is no vanity nothing fake no facade just him pure and simple its really calming listening to him
i love 2341 where margot is talking about their morning dance parties and how fun it is a cillian is just like ahhh bc he was in an artistic black hole doing this dark movie ive seen other actors from oppenheimer saying that they were having the best time and murphy had to be focused and couldntdidnt join in bc he was depriving himself of sleep and so zoned in and focused but his reaction to her saying how much fun it was made me laugh 
the fact that margot is cillians biggest fan makes this even better  loved this pairing and this convo
the reference about the phd woman who cant introspect is pure genius from greta impressive association to make with a barbie character wow
the barbenheimer phenomenon was so crazy usually when two big movies come out simultaneously one suffers greatly but in this case both movie actually helped the other movie succeed evm more
hands down the best actors on actors interview ever cillian and margot are such gems in themselves so coming together for this thoughtful back and forth was so special my first time actually getting through an entire aoa episode 3
cillian and margots dynamic is one where you would think it would be something so odd because of how almost paradoxal it is but this interview with them paired together honestly couldnt have worked out better both of them are so humble and grounded in their respective crafts and it was so easy to just sit and admire them for who they are",24,Entertainment,1260000,PT48M28S,"['barbenheimer taking over the summer something the world needed two completely different movie bringing people together', 'the person who paired them deserves raise', 'rare see cillian murphy enjoying interview and all for', 'apparently cillians team that reached out variety asking for the pairing and find that super wholesome', 'audience not_ like being told you should see this you should see that they will decide and they will generate the interest themselves such brilliant quote', 'cillian doe not_ look like hate life this how delightful see him smile and laugh through the conversation initiated this pairing and wanted there please give him more chance make his own choice the result seeing him truly happy engage with someone', 'can take moment appreciate that the producer even matched the microphone the outfit', 'feel good see fulllengthconversationalinterview being given cilian could totally relate with margot when she started talking and asking question about peaky blinder', 'love how just ask her question and keep her talking fellow introvert what classic move', 'you all the way devouring every single bit cillians talking only the fan know how precious having him speaking lightly and for such long time that man never show anywhere doe not_ have social medium suffering love him', 'margot masterclass how combine beauty and brain her insight being producer are interesting she involved the entire process from day one', 'love how margot doe not_ let cillian get away with his modest attitude and really grill him charming way subject like his apparent unawareness the meme and the reason why nolan love work with him', '', 'you can really sense that she 100 authentic and doe not_ shy away from confidently stating that she knew that the movie going hit and that her performance influential convincing matell', 'brought much joy watch these two discovering each others role natural and calm energy and amazing see them being engaged their character', 'just love how natural cillian vanity nothing fake facade just him pure and simple really calming listening him', 'love 2341 where margot talking about their morning dance party and how fun cillian just like ahhh because artistic black hole doing this dark movie have seen other actor from oppenheimer saying that they were having the best time and murphy had focused and couldntdidnt join because depriving himself sleep and zoned and focused but his reaction her saying how much fun made laugh', 'the fact that margot cillians biggest fan make this even better loved this pairing and this conversation', 'the reference about the phd woman who cannot introspect pure genius from greta impressive association make with barbie character wow', 'the barbenheimer phenomenon crazy usually when two big movie come out simultaneously one suffers greatly but this case both movie actually helped the other movie succeed evm more', 'hand down the best actor actor interview ever cillian and margot are such gem themselves coming together for this thoughtful back and forth special first time actually getting through entire aoa episode', 'cillian and margots dynamic one where you would think would something odd because how almost paradoxal but this interview with them paired together honestly could not_ have worked out better both them are humble and grounded their respective craft and easy just sit and admire them for who they are']",2908

filmed at up to 1750000 with the phantom tmx 7510
how the nintendo zapper worked in slow motion  the slow mo guys",2262,"i really want to see the laser scanner at a grocery store checkout  it seems to have mirrors moving very fast
i assume it flashes the boxes in two different frames so it can know which one you hit otherwise it wouldnt be able to tell which of the boxes youre aiming at
id love to see an inkjet printer in slowmotion i think the ink droplets falling on paper would be interesting
i love these quieter informative videos you do gav im glad youve kept them going after the lockdowns theyre fascinating
this continues to be magic how they figured out they could do this is unfathomable
so creative i love how when a technology is less developed creators are forced to use ingenuity and you get so many interesting things instead of twelve versions of the same thing
this game was a gem of my childhood once you discover the second controller can control the ducks its a whole new game
as a 37 year old now i was always curious how this worked and i also noticed the whole screen flashing on the menu really cool video
this is genuinely ahead of its time so much thinking and programming went even to make sure you wont cheat by pointing it at a white bulb not to mention nobody back then had slowmo cameras to even figure this out do more such smaller but super intriguing videos man
would really love to see the droplets from an inkjet printer 
that bit of filming the crt at super slomo alone is worth this video incredible stuff
this stuff is so amazing i live seeing how things from my childhood worked thank you
the reason it shows two white boxes on separate frames is so that it can tell which duck you shot at because whether it sees the first or second frame determines which duck it was
absolutely fascinating  i was total duck hunt maniac back in 80s and also obsessed about how things work  thank you so much for this slomo retrospective 
if you had a second crt on a channel that wasnt broadcasting static  snow and shot at it it was always a hit
this truly is brilliant i never would have guessed thats how it worked
this is so fascinating that i want to tell this to my grandkids how real engineering was done back in the days but i am afraid i am gonna forget it by then any tips to remember such a cool thing
i really like these how it works style of video there is so much technology that we take for granted that do amazing things in the blink of an eye
one thing people my friends at least didnt notice in duck hunt was that while in two player mode you could control the ducks movement with the controller while the other player was playing my friends would get frustrated that there ducks would move a lot more then mine would and id tell them theyre imagining it
so thats how it works i always wondered about that thanks for sharing this with us",24,Entertainment,14900000,PT5M24S,"['really want see the laser scanner grocery store checkout seems have mirror moving very fast', 'assume flash the box two different frame can know which one you hit otherwise would not_ able tell which the box you are aiming', 'love see inkjet printer slowmotion think the ink droplet falling paper would interesting', 'love these quieter informative video you gav glad you have kept them going after the lockdown they are fascinating', 'this continues magic how they figured out they could this unfathomable', 'creative love how when technology developed creator are forced use ingenuity and you get many interesting thing instead twelve version the same thing', 'this game gem childhood once you discover the second controller can control the duck whole new game', 'year old now always curious how this worked and also noticed the whole screen flashing the menu really cool video', 'this genuinely ahead time much thinking and programming went even make sure you will not_ cheat pointing white bulb not_ mention nobody back then had slowmo camera even figure this out more such smaller but super intriguing video man', 'would really love see the droplet from inkjet printer', 'that bit filming the crt super slomo alone worth this video incredible stuff', 'this stuff amazing live seeing how thing from childhood worked thank you', 'the reason show two white box separate frame that can tell which duck you shot because whether see the first second frame determines which duck', 'absolutely fascinating total duck hunt maniac back and also obsessed about how thing work thank you much for this slomo retrospective', 'you had second crt channel that not_ broadcasting static snow and shot always hit', 'this truly brilliant never would have guessed that how worked', 'this fascinating that want tell this grandkids how real engineering done back the day but afraid going forget then any tip remember such cool thing', 'really like these how work style video there much technology that take for granted that amazing thing the blink eye', 'one thing people friend least did not_ notice duck hunt that while two player mode you could control the duck movement with the controller while the other player playing friend would get frustrated that there duck would move lot more then mine would and tell them they are imagining', 'that how work always wondered about that thanks for sharing this with']",324
