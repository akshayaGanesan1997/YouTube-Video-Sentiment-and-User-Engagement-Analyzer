US,_inKs4eeHiI,KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,2023-12-13T15:43:38Z,,4120394,275123,"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8

This spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world’s most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. 

After three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to … give it a rest already. More specifically, he’s tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.

That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. 

Even worse, there’s been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po’s Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. 

So, Po’s going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po’s fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon’s reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. 

The film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy Award® winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Po’s adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy Award® nominee Bryan Cranston as Po’s birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifu’s former student and arch-nemesis. Oscar® winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. 
 
Kung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animation’s The Bad Guys). The film’s co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy Award®-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animation’s highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.

I can’t be the only one that thinks they would make a good show based off these animations 🔥🔥
This was amazing as always. I wish the Grand Warden and Royal Champion had voice lines as well. Maybe someday.
Amazing Animation 😊 with more Fun 😂

Lyrics: 
[Becky G]
Si se supone que ya te olvide 
Que lo de nosotros ya descansa en paz
Dime que hago aqui en mi soledad 
Pensando en como estas 

[Leonardo Aguilar]
Dime si hay otra boca que te besa
Si todavía sigo en tu cabeza 
Quiero saber si con otro tattoo 
Te tapastes mi nombre 
Con otro nombre

[Becky G]
Yo por el contrario casi perdió el alma
Pa no sentir tu adiós que me desarma  
Trate de negociarlo con el karma 
Y me dijo todo se paga 
Todo se paga

[Ángela Aguilar]
Yo por el contrario casi vendo el alma 
A cambio de vivir sin sentir nada 
Y se que se me nota en la mirada  
Que tus recuerdos maltratan 
Pero aun no me mata 

[Becky G]
Quise hablar con el karma y pedirle que me dejara 
Olvidar su cara 
Que me perdonará
Porque siento que apuntas pero no disparas
Le grito a dios por qué me desamparas 

[Ángela Aguilar]
Aveces miento 
Pa ver si siento 
Que puedo respirar sin ti

[Leonardo Aguilar]
Pero tu sabes que no es así
Tu si estas bien sin mi 

[Ángela Aguilar]
Yo por el contrario casi pierdo el alma 
Por no sentir tu adiós que me desarma 
Trate de negociarlo con el karma 
Me dijo todo se paga 
Todo se paga

[Becky G]
Yo por el contrario casi vendo el alma 
A cambio de vivir sin sentir nada 
Y se que se me nota en la mirada 
Que tu recuerdos maltratan 
Pero aun no me mata

The saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”

The big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), Souheila Yacoub (“The Braves,” “Climax”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).

“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

Villeneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel. The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick. The executive producers are Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.

Villeneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Denis Villeneuve, “Dune: Part Two.” The film is slated for a March 1, 2024 release in theaters and IMAX nationwide and internationally beginning on 28 February 2024, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",7410,"Let's be honest, Denis Villeneuve, the music, the trailer, was just epic. One of the best trailers I have seen in years.
This looks incredible! When we say we want the visuals THIS is what we mean. 😭
I haven't gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years.  This can only be seen properly in theatre.
Denis Villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed. Also the fact that they've built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love Denis and the team have for the process.
This film stands as the cinematic masterpiece we've been yearning for, elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights. Its impact on the sci-fi genre is unprecedented, setting a new benchmark for future endeavors!
“But I do see a way… there is a narrow way through…” I absolutely love the way he said that line! I’m so excited for this movie!
This film is the cinematic brilliance we've been waiting for for decades. It really takes movie making to another level. I really don't think there is any sci-fi series like this one is showing up to be.
By far, one of the finest movie trailer in recent years. The build up is just so powerful and awe-inspiring (especially with the gorgeous music). Denis seems to have outdone himself with this one. This is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope. It is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years. He is also the new master of intelligent and profound Science-Fiction films. I mean, Arrival, Blade Runner: 2049, Dune Part One, Dune Part 2 and most probably following next will be Rendezvous with Rama and Dune: Messiah. An amazingly talented artist.
That SILENCE!! gave me serious chills, I had to watch it again, can't wait to see the actual scene 😭
This is not a movie. This is pure art.
How the heck does Denis Villeneuve deliver yet another ""classic"" that works so ridiculously well this day and age... incredible!! I am just hoping he does more projects similar to this (taking an ""oldie"" and bringing it to the modern audience).
I'm a huge fan of the Dune universe and I absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books!! There's also a game in development called Dune Awakening, so I love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 🥳🥳🥳
This movie franchise is a work of art. Love the books, love everything about Part I, Part II is a must see.
Princess Irulan looks like a prisoner of fate. You can tell the team behind this is on the next level, when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a character's costume embodies their story.
YESSSSSS!!    Throughout the trailer I had goosebumps, bigger than I have ever had! Clean to the end, and even after!!!!   I don’t think I have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does!!!!
Since the first Dune movie, I've been obsessed. Best stuff that has come out of Hollywood in years. Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer go hand in hand here, cause it was the first time I came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score. My Spotify Top 5 of '23 is all Dune :))) Hats off, and I really look forward to Dune 2, not less than how I looked forward to The Return of the King 20 years ago.
Absolutely blown away by this trailer! The visuals, storyline, and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters. Can't wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen!
Major goosebumps. Everything about this looks incredible. I loved Part 1 and I'm all in for Part 2 - I just wish I could watch it now.
The cinematic event I've been waiting for. Dune will win best director, editor, cinematographer, music, costume and VFX. If it doesn't then I don't know what should. This is a pure labour of love. I would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does. Cannot wait!
Denis Villeneuve is an absolute master - I've loved all of his movies, this will be incredible, just like part 1 was...",1,Film & Animation,11300000,PT2M40S

lol nice animation
Loved seeing Nabiu with a doortal at 5:33, can't wait for the pilot!
5:10 All things considered, Ganon using his own health bar as a weapon is metal asf
Rauru: “It would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi-“ 

Link: *wing shield jumps disrespectfully*
The five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
I love the ending where it seems that Link is going to save Zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until Link realizes that the speedrun is over.
I don't know what Zelda told Rauru about Link,but he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
I appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch. Even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and I appreciate that you gave it some meaning. And the Ganondorf fight was next level.
I already knew he couldn’t get wrecked like the other endbosses because of *Suavemente* but I never would have expected that his weakness was no *Suavemente* .
Also I laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon.
In all it’s accurate to the source material and continue what you do best.
The fact that Ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and I love it 😂
The life ending neck cracks throughout the Terminal Montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
When Ganon started  dancing Suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears, love the details 😂😂
Merry Christmas 🎄 Jeremy, big hugs to you and the team, I love your work ❤
All the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing, I’ve been waiting for this one for a while
Gotta love how Link doesn't even bother trying to save Zelda the first time, then doesn't even visibly question or react (beyond the mandated QTE) to the fact that she's suddenly appeared out of nowhere in free-fall... and _STILL_ leaves her to take a dunk in the lake. 😂
4:25 this is my favorite moment, you can feel link's determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
A rush of dopamine always hits hard every time I enjoy the chaos of another video. 

Also I love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol.
4:21 I can't imagine how terrified that bokoblin must've been: he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing ""hyah"" sounds, and then Link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
Your animations will never get old
3:25 As much as I find the gloom hands to be terrifying, I would imagine it would be cool if Ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack Lookout landing. It wouldn’t add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like Ganondorf was more of a threat.
4:47 is seriously the coolest attack animation you’ve ever done!
the amount of effort that goes into these is bonkers and I'm so grateful (as, I expect, are the speedrunners!)",20,Gaming,4360000,PT7M18S

The fact blue think he doesn't rap off beat is crazy. And the fact he thinks we can really name 3 of his songs is even more crazy
Marco is very tactical. Not your average comedian. Interviewer. Influencer. Nothing lol.
If you watch this with no sort of bias against blueface, he and Marco are truly just hilarious idiots😂😂😂
It never fails! Every time Marco gives you a compliment he follows it with a diss ! “I think you smart and can do a lot of things. So why can’t you rap on beat?”😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
He done took them sunglasses onnand off fifty million times 😂😂😂😂😂
Marco’s face when blueface said “I’ve never had that hairstyle” 😂
Their personalities mix very well😂😂😂😂 I was weak the whole time 💯
That man said “ name 3 bluface songs rn.” He really responded with “or I die?” 😂😂😂😂😂
Let me roll up THIS shit gon be HILARIOUS😂😂😂
The crumpled 100 when Blueface was talking having to fight 4 ppl was a great touch 😂😂😂
Two statements, I took to be genuinely useful:

“You don’t have to be good at anything. You just have to be good at trying“

“it’s a partnership. The wins are doubled and the losses are split.”
Marco will literally go down in history for these interviews.. I'm over here screaming 😂
Marco is the GOAT for this!!!! The fact that Marco could name 2 is AMAZING ! I was struggling with one !
Comedians really are a gift to depression 😭
Blue- “I’ve never had that hairstyle”💇‍♂️ 
Marco- “🙂” 

The way I busted out laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂  I know Marco wanted to laugh fr
Blueface is a great sport, he definitely had the personality for tv and shit 😂😂😂
It takes a strong man to do these interviews with these types of people…I salute you Marco

Kratos is not just the god of war,but he is now,the god of hope.
Kratos, the Spartan, the god of war, and most importantly, the father of boy, is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts.
There's something eerie about seeing a younger Kratos in this modern light. I've grown to love the Older Kratos, but at the same time you are terrified of the younger Kratos.
The god of war becomes the god of hope. I think we can all agree that Kratos deserved this ending more than anything.
Everyone's talking about Young Kratos (and rightfully so), but can we give a round of applause for Tyr? The fact we got to fight him not once, but FOUR TIMES was amazing. And that last encounter? Pure Awesome.
That young Kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look. They did great job in representing young wild Kratos who still doesn't seem to understand what was going on with him at that point🔥
If old kratos hates himself from the past, you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed. What an absolute legend
Seeing Tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more, he truly has traveled a lot
Kratos really came full circle. He became the God of Hope. When all else was lost he still found hope to move on. I’m happy to see he never forgotten Pandora’s words.
The size difference and the different vibes young Kratos and Old Kratos have is amazing. Specially when young Kratos moved from his pose, it was so menacing
I'm not gonna lie, I almost teared up watching this ending.

Mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching Kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational.

Definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way.
Looking at this scene, I can't help but think how many times I have wanted to do the exact same thing Kratos did. Staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young, selfish, stupid, cruel, and nothing more than a lowly piece of work, but then realize how far I have come in my years. I needed this more than anyone could realize. Kratos, your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that I was in tears. Your story, one of death, destruction, and chaos, but also of love, redemption, and hope. You bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question: Who am I? We are who we choose to be, both of our past, and of our present.
Love how Kratos finally confronts all his regrets, and it hits hard.
God of War Ragnarok Valhalla Full movie / All cutscenes: https://youtu.be/b2vyOIMZgnI
7:58 This scene gotta be the most powerful scene in the whole gow franchise🔥
6:50 — 9:52
This is honestly Christopher Judge’s best performance I have ever seen. The emotions, the anger, the hate and then the sadness to pure realisation in his voice honestly made me teary inside.
This was such an emotional journey. Thank you so much to Santa Monica Studio for this beautiful gift. They're amazing for this who agrees with me? Seeing young Kratos meet with redeemed Kratos, facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light. This hits home for me because I suffer with mental health disorders and seeing Kratos face his younger self will be me when I recover.
Kratos confronting his younger self…
In my head, I picture that he’s gaining closure with his bloodthirsty past, and telling him that THIS is what he needed to become. The god of hope. The father of Boy. The god of redemption.
After everything Kratos has been through... He's earned this.",20,Gaming,1550000,PT13M29S

An actual high school problem arc is gonna be so sick. I can't wait to see Ayda interact with the other characters!
Freshman year came out when I was a freshman in high school, sophomore year came out when I was a sophomore in high school, and now junior year is coming our when I am a junior in college. Thank you Dimension 20. You all mean the world to me.
I still can't believe this is really gonna happen!  Fantasy High will always hold a very special place in my D&D heart.  Can't wait to see what these 9th-level chaos goblins get up to next!  HOOT GROWL BABY!

Finally, we can wrap up the night yorb plot line.
To quote my D&D group, “This is our Super Bowl.”
I love those sketch drawings with everyone's name card. Adaine's especially
I’m so excited I might cry. Fantasy high was my introduction to not only Dropout but Dungeons and Dragons as well. I can’t wait to see what the Bad Kids get up to in their Junior Year!
I started watching fantasy high when the first two season had already been filmed. I was going into my freshman year of highschool the summer i started. I rewatched both seasons over and over, I started dnd campaigns and watched all of the new dnd adventures as they came out. In 2024, i graduate. I have a plan to go to college to write a book one day. This series and its actors have been integral to my growth and life throughout highschool, and in my worst moments and exam seasons I have turned to them for a break, a reminder than I'm not alone. I can't express enough how much it means to me to see another season of this after all the changes and growth I've gone through.
I’m in love with how visible the improvements in the set & budget are from Fantasy High: Freshman Year. So excited to see the story of the original intrepid heroes continue!
as someone who got into dimension 20 earlier this year, i literally could not be happier that this is going on now!!! the first episode is coming out the month i turn 16 and i genuinely feel like im growing with the characters
This.... this means that Senior Year will also eventually happen right? I don't wanna get too ahead of myself but these lovable goofs/role models got me anticipating two seasons for the price of one. Insane hype.
Losing my mind at buff Kristen?!? Can't wait to see what new existential crisis Ally has in store for us
I am so unspeakably excited!  Dimension 20 is always so much fun but Fantasy High really does hold a special place in my heart.

Suggestion: the wolf armor could be colored with dyes, like the leather pieces!
I sincerely hope they make it so you can dye the wolf armour later on or maybe trim it or something
Excited for the last big 1.21 announced feature so far in the armadillo and wolf armour, very curious what will be coming in the rest of the update now :)
The armadillo and wolf armour look great in-game! Didn't expect to see it done so soon!
Can it be enchanted? Can we dye it? I hope they keep developing it so its a viable item to get for our dogs.
Suggestion: Can it be enchanted? Protection IV on wolf armour would be awesome!
“Trust us to introduce a cuddly new mob and give it the yuckiest food imaginable” 
Fireflies:
Wolf armor and the armadillo are better than expected
Suggestion: Can we enchant the armor? Like with thorns or even protection? Just to get the most out of it
Finally a use for spider eyes other than brewing. I wish they ate rotten flesh as well but I can just give those to the wolves.
It would be cool to be able to upgrade it with a smithing table, maybe even add trims. Being able to dye the armour is also something i see all over the comments ofc.
Aw sad to see the eye placement from the concept art not carry over. It so much more accurate to what actual armadillos look like and would have looked so much cuter/less goofy than the current iteration.
we all thought it was gonna be like one defense, but daimond armor for wolfs is sick

Yusuf Amir is so lucky, this is the first GTA Online video that has less dislikes and the community is less pissed. 😂
i love this so far; the game feels fun again and more alive. even just adding the animals has made things so much better. i love the new cars and im playing the missions rn. thanks rockstar, banger after banger.
can we all appreciate how long rockstar has kept gta 5 alive? its awesome to see a game from my childhood still relevant all these years later
Amir is one of my favorite side characters it the series and its so good seeing him back.

For me one of the best updates so far. Thanks Rockstar thats what we want.
It's not a game it's pure GOOSEBUMPS ❤
I was convinced they couldn't add no more content to gta online lol but they gotta keep us entertained somehow gta online is the appetizer but we all know what the main course is 😋
Fico imaginando, algum dia a Rockstar conseguir fazer um mundo aberto para o GTA, com pelo menos uma região de cada País do mundo ou pelo menos os Países mais populares de cada região, iria ser INSANO se isto algum dia acontecesse

#UFC",2092,"Brandon Royval just casually running 10 miles at 6.5-minute pace is impressive. Dude has excellent cardio.
Leon’s first NFL game was one of the worst scoring games ever 😭 3-0
My takeaways from this:
I am absolutely exhausted watching Pantoja workout. What a demon.
Paddy catches a lot of shit. When he’s away from a hot mic regarding fighting, he seems like a good guy.
As an American, I want to apologize to Leon for attending that awful fuckin NFL game.
Heart says Wonderboy 
Brain says Shavkat 😔
Watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art. Shit is so impressive, man.
Tony is 0-6, yet I still can’t wait for his appearance on the embedded.

Guy really is a legend, and a hell of an entertainer. Hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens.
100% respect Colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class. How can you not respect it.
You gotta respect Colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class. Half of the champions in the ufc or more don’t fight at their normal weight class
You can tell that Colby is a good guy and just plays a character. Seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter 🙏🏼 People have to separate the PPV selling Colby from the person he seems to be
The flash of genuine Colby when they brought out the candles, you could tell he loved that
Still makes me sad Pantoja got booed after he won the belt. He left it all in the Octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears. “Dad are your proud of me now “ 

I like both Brandon and Alexandre but I’m rooting for Alexandre
You just can't hate Thompson, so humble
So pumped to see Colby back in action. The guy is a true gem of the sport, hate or love him, he’s thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the Octagon.
Really rooting for Colby to get it done. He is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat Colby twice decisively.
Not a Colby fan but I respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport. He seems to always be in fighting shape. He has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
Thing i love the most about Colby is, He doesnt cut much weight, Maybe 4 kilos, he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
Cool seeing Colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment. This card is gonna be a banger 🔥🔥🔥
Man Wonderboy does not look 40 years old at all! 😳💯
Seeing Pantoja and JDS so happy and down to earth is so damn wholesome
Can tell Colby is actually a really good dude. His manners and respect to the waiter were absolutely tops 👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT9M25S

""I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,"" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.

Laufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with ""From The Start,"" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's ""Let You Break My Heart Again"" and ""Promise,"" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with ""California and Me,"" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.

Laufey is just so good. She even tweeted back in 2021 that she'd like to be on Tiny Desk someday. It's 2023 and she's achieved that. Bravo!
First time listener. If they don’t cast Laufey as a Disney Princess and have her sing the songs, just shoot me dead
Tiny Desk + Leufey + Strings = perfection.
For all the Laufers that wanna come back again:

It's crazy to think about how far she has come after that viral cover of 'I wish you love'. Definitely a result of great talent and hard work!
such a beautiful voice, she's gonna be a modern legend
I can't think of a more ""NPR"" artist than Laufey. Perfect match.
This is my first time hearing this melodious voice.  Laufey and her band woke me up this morning. What a joy.
Is it just me, but I can’t help but admire her in every possible way
i wish this tiny desk would last like 1 hour, 19 minutes of laufey's voice IS NOT ENOUGH
That was unbelievable, I had only ever heard the first song before. I just cried my eyes out. I can’t remember the last time music I hadn’t hear before hit me on such an emotional level. Such perfectly crafted songs, such palpable melancholy. I am overwhelmed in the best way possible.
Such a beautiful voice 😊. I've listened to Laufey's songs during the past few months and seeing her perfoming live at Tiny Desk is such a treat. I've had teary eyes during Promise 😢. I'd love to see her live one day :).
Her voice scale, control and timbre are just incredible. She reminds me of Ella in how she hits her lows. New fan.
What an honor to play chamber music with Laufey on this series 🤍 Hope soon again ✨
As a person who grew up in the classical music world, fell in love with it and then had to leave it behind, listening to you is simply a warm hug to the heart. Just thank you Laufey, amazing ❤
The audio engineer is a real hero to have captured this so perfectly so the rest of us could feel like we were in the room.

Sukuna is interested in the Executional Sword,so he tune down the slash to not kill them immediately.
Looking at the last panel, those slashes look like the normal version, not the existence cutting ones. Sukuna just said he's interested in the executioner's sword, so he might toy with higuruma a bit.
Yuji did something with that punch I just know it, it didn't seem like anything significant at the time but there's no way that those guys are surviving regular slashes when Ryo was turned into pork chops.
Not gonna lie Gege is the real sukuna😂😂
I don’t think it’s necessarily every slash of sukuna that can now cut the world,just the ones he chooses,probably these were his normal dismantle slashes
We didn't see maki intervening the fight. Our crew did calculated something wrong but i think they must've had another backup plan.
we'll learn that kusakabe is actually just him and his simple domain is simply built different
5:46 your wrong, that slashes are just a weaker version than the one that killed gojo, sukuna is probably just playing with them, just to intereste himself, since he wants to see higurumas sword!
I’m so excited because Hakari is back
When Yuji’s granddad said to die surrounded by the people he loved, he didn’t specify if they had to be alive. Yuji could die surrounded by the corpses of everyone in jujutsu high for all we know.
even if sukuna's CT got confiscated, he still has his cursed tools. damn, he comes prepared.
Bold speculation suggeting all of Sukunas attacks will only ever be the upgraded slashes and not something he toggles when he wants to use them.
God this one seriously takes me off guard, i really can't imagine what will happen because i can find no reason to our crew to not being cut in half, just sukuna's mood.
Hope they find a way cus i like so much all of the ones in the battlefield right now
no he is absolutely just going easy on the slashes. He could 100% just do that massive world cutting slash and end them all but he doesnt, he wants to fight since all the strongest sorcerers in the world are gathered in one place to fight him
Maan Gege ain't conceding anything regarding Sukuna lol. Every theory i had on how the fight will go depended on Sukuna losing Shrine. Add the Kenjaku shenanigans plus this and i can safely say i have no idea how any of this will go down.
With all that being said Hakari is a beast and Uraume better show us something!!
Good luck on your college exams my guy, thanks for the awesome video and leaks
I'm really hyped for the next chapter
I think the reason gege decided to take away the CT of the tool over the Slashes was because of Yuji. Yuji was stated to be a curse object soaked in Sukunas curse energy. Since we already saw how purple did less damage to gojo because it was his own attack, we can assume the same for Slashes to yuji. If he would have taken the slashes then yuji could have gotten one shotted by the curse tool made by a thousand binding vows.
Seeing a glimpse of the hakari fight was everything, THAT BOY BUILT DIFFERENTTTTTTT. Def looking forward to seeing what uraume does, there’s a reason why they’re so close to Sukuna and we will see why soon",24,Entertainment,64900,PT8M3S

Bidstrup took it like a legend. Huge respect
Edit:Wtf I checked my phone cuz I thought this comment got 1 like 💀💀
It's always a long wait for a new video from Chris. But when it finally arrives, it's a piece of cinematic gold...
The video we've all been waiting for, let us know if you wanna play for us soon 😉
To everyone in the comments, check out our channel for more Chris vs Mads content 🙌
I swear Harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 😭
Bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
Your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
You notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round. They are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge. Small things but big differences
Manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
Chris dashing the ball at W2S mum brought it to another level. 😂
Awesome to see Levi Colwill in this video, met him when Sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against Hamworthy United.
the pros were all really down to earth that's cool to see
The way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
Bidstrup’s a class guy, seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to Gurnsey to record that clip with Harry’s mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
Chris is one of the best YouTube football dribblers, he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still won’t preform the same in a charity match🤦
Crazy that Bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is Di Maria, & Benfica Has just won 3-1 Salzburg.
Di Maria Scoring a Corner Goal. Absolutely INSANEEE!!!

You probably won't see this video, but it doesn't matter, I'm sending my strength to you man, every time I go into the comments I see people talking about how the video is or So saying that you are no longer the same. ""I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS SECOND IS ALL OF THEM."" But anyway, I came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us, and for what you have to go through with rude comments, I don't know how you are behind that screen, but I hope you are well, they will probably tell me If anyone sees this, you deserve a rest, man, take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity, go out with your friends, and go to a place to rest your mind... Well, I just said that because I'm really worried about your psychology, all the work you do when it comes to being private, motherfucker, saying skibidi skibidi all the time, and in return getting insults that you're not the same anymore... that's it, probably. No one will read this but it's here, now I'm less worried.
What i love about episode 68, is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story, one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also, R.I.P large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
Dude, the large characters are THE underappreciated heroes, seeing as the large speakerman died, then the large cameraman, that might mean that large TV man is next on the chopping block. RIP large cameraman.
Wow. Inspiring, to say the least. A year ago today I was standing on a 351-849 mile long sandwich 🥪 (which, too be fair, had no mustard) and was about to eat it all 😅. This video, along with the tuna song saved me. ❤

Meebkin: three fingers, three bumps on tail + head crest, three creatures (meebkin itself and two meebs)
Gaddzooks: three eyes, three toes, three mouths
Yooreek: three fingers 
Blarret: three mouths, three nails
Auglur: three hands
Nitebear: three eyes, three toes, three fingers (brown hand), three body sections (brown half, blue half, greenish head)
Flasque: three sections of the head, three toes, three floating flasks
Whaill: four toes
Fun fact: gadzooks now has a new track (the one that was teased but was never shown on the new island
Was not expecting how these new monsters would sound, but I do like them all a lot! It is nice to see the island be extended with these additions, and while there is still a long way to go, I can already start to see the direction this island will take!
I can’t wait to hear what the rest of the song brings. These new guys are all great!
Flasque is so satisfying to hear. It’s like monster ASMR
I love how Nitebear is straight up inspired from FNaF, but also keeping it original
Whaill adds so much more to the song, now im curious for what the full song will be like
You can already tell that this island is gonna look chaotic and sound amazing when its done.
They’ve changed the vibe of the song completely!
I’m glad we got a metal clanging sound. It fits the workshop vibe. My only complaint is the Whaill verse. It sounds cool but it doesn’t flow too well into the next verse.
Was wondering when Gadzook's second track would be implemented.  Love the new verse.  Song is beautiful so far!
Flasque is putting in such insane work
I love how they added another track for Gaddzooks and how Nitebear is based on FNAF. Whaill looks absolutely great as well. The MSM developers really are putting their love into the game.
I have an affinity towards Mech elementals thanks to Vhamp, and Nitebear had satisfied my cravings as a FNAF fan. The other 2 are great too.
Damn this sounds great. Can't wait for future updates.
I thought this island was gonna be ruined by more monsters but they definitely made it better
Honestly I wish the other more stable ethereals were on the island, but it is really good!
I love that none of them have any kind of synergy but they do at the same time",20,Gaming,500000,PT1M46S

#pokemon #legendarypokemon #infinitefusion",532,"Pokemon fusions are one thing, but the fact things like Deoxys and Regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
The only thing I regret is not fusing more Legendaries with Magikarp
I actually like this „twist” to a fusions playthrough, because we get to see the cooler/rarer fusions
No chance John wins that champion battle without Tyler, he really saved the day
The miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now. Tysm John and Tyler for putting this in
I Love that John still names his Requazas Gregory after that epic JMC episode in Season 1. 
I also love how John plays this game we all know Legends are the most fun to fuse XD
9:35 Loving the Ben 10 reference with this one. Been rewatching it this week for the first time since I was a kid AND just finished my first ever Infinite Fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a Chronosapien/Clockwork reference in this Fangame! I hope you do more videos on it!
PM7 providing top notch quality videos right when I’m about to eat lunch. Lovely!
I love all the screams Tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
""How can you follow up Giratina Square""
Lance: another one
Roger is one of my favourite fusions I've seen across all Infinite Fusion content! Love the videos John!
That Raikou/Hydreigon is so sick! That could definitely be a boss battle in Dark Souls or something.
I've always wanted to play Infinite Fusion but just have never found the time, it's nice to see someone exploring all the fun Legendary Fusions!
I can't believe it, he actually evolved Feesh. Raydos might look awesome, but it'll never recapture the image of Rayeesh
I seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 😂
LET""S GO!!!! Clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurk/dialga fusion!
25:31 That just about killed me.
It's never too late to do a playthough of a game! I've seen lots of Infinite Fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it! Really looking forward to the next part!
Also, I think the catch rate might be higher in this game (or fluctuate depending on the fusion) but I was still left in suspense at all the captures!
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end, but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level, so you dont see slugma's and pichu's in the elite 4
Super happy you're planning to do another video on this game! I'm a spriter for the game and I'd love to see you use some of my Legendary fusions! They won't be in the game until January though due to the update schedule for sprites",20,Gaming,819000,PT35M47S

We love beta squad videos, even if they come out 4 days late!!!
The riggedness and Niko had me giggling 😭😭
Respect to Niko, Sharky and Kenny for winning after the most bias refereeing ever
thank god red team won because it was so frustrating seeing the game being rigged 😭
Even though they were half a week late we still can't complain, best content on youtube right now
Chunkz is that friend that can dish out banter but can’t take it lmaoo
you know its gon be a good video when darkest is the host 🙏‼️
Chunkz getting angry over a game, I respect the guy but no need to attack Kenny 😂
I'm sure even kenny is shocked to see this level of rigging, respect for doing charity work and still playing.
Aj, Filly and Chunkz are basically the 'Annoying' team that you can get
How do you rob a game and still lose😂😂😂
Can we appreciate how sweet it was when darkest said I love u babes about his wife. Like all the videos that darkest has had recently and mentions of his wife he has literally been a gentleman about
Beta squad never disappoints
Sharky says ""20 v 1 Filly Edition"" and AJ says ""20 v 1 Harry Edition"" and Darkest gives it to AJ 🤣
I just love Niko and Kenny's friendship ❤
We can all agree Filly likes handout points! And high key a sour looser!
We need a non biased host next time

Props to Keith and Becky for keeping their baby very private. Shows they're already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them.
The mystery event is 100% a 24 hour livestream of Eugene sitting on Keith's lap.
so much respect for Keith and Becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality *ahem*. that is the way to raise a child as a public figure. congrats to you both!
I appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to Eugene. The fact that he’s off making his dreams come true and they don’t make him pick try guys over that is amazing. He’s still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy ❤
I can’t believe the return of candid competition isn’t the biggest announcement that’s incredible news
I consider Kwesi an official Try Guy. He fits so well, he’s so perfect. So funny and sweet.
even though the situation that caused it was awful, i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible. the variance of content, the variance of on-camera personalities, it's all such a breath of fresh air. there's so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now, there really is something for everyone.
I miss Eugene, but we're all proud of him, and excited for everything he's a part of. I struggle with change, but y'all make it exciting.
I would love to see another episode about Zach talking about his chronic pain management. Him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot!
The best thing Try Guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in. Jared, Kwesi, Johnny, Marissa are the best additions to the Try Family.
Okay, I gotta say. You guys blow my mind. I first arrived here because of ~the event~ but I stayed here because I liked your personality, and because I was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or “dumb” they are. In the past year I’ve been learning more and more about how you manage the company, how you create more content, etc and wow, I respect it so much. And this video just confirmed it even more for me.
Honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the Keith and Zach channel and Eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and Zach and Keith have always been my favorite try guys
I've said it before and I'll say it again. This channel has the most talented editors. Every single video looks SO incredible.
I really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen. So happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth!
i am so damn proud of them. To see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years, i am SO DAMN PROUD
We miss Eugene when he's not here, but I'm so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them, I hope it all turn out great for him <3
The way they are so candid about why they’re charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on YouTube is incredible honestly I love that about them
I love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship
I did NOT KNOW Eugene voiced in Nimona!!! Sad to hear he’ll be less in videos but letting him follow his dreams is also so incredibly exciting!",23,Comedy,8060000,PT8M23S

FYI, there is also passive income if you buy the tow truck and the wall safe upgrade, so keep in mind. Avoid the staff upgrade unless you have spare money, so keep in mind. Should work like the one in the Auto Shop. This comment is for beginners only
I got my eyes on the new Mustang... Finally... a proper modern Mustang...
Just done the Cayo Perico start to finish (exactly the same way Taco does it) and I only noticed one small change. 
It the intel gather mission, when you steal the plane to fly to the island, the driver side door is no longer stuck open. This is excellent for my OCD 😂
I regret choosing the most expensive location. Hard to get into shop, gang attack could spawn, and cars don’t always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the MOC to have the led´s from the Christmas Truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 Here is your Weekly Update video including all of the things added in the Winter DLC ""Chop Shop"" What do you think of this new DLC so far? More vids coming throughout the day!
Prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane.
The Range Rover was on my very short list along with the Escalade V and that 96 Impala SS was an AMAZING surprise but I'm still hurt about no new   Dubsta AKA G55/63... it's got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community. The Turismo and the chop shop are the only things I'll have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me.
The new Grotti drives so damn nice! Liking the new Declasse Impaler LX but I just love them type of muscle cars anyway. The Vigero ZX and Dominator are pretty cool but I still prefer the roof up. Best feature so far... The garage organizer!
The vehicle prices are crazy 😂 I wish it was more like real life
Tuner update and Chop Shop are my fav so far, love the low grips and manual stick!
So far so good this is a solid DLC it's a W from me still would have liked to have a heist with this DLC as well but it's all good.
Top tier. I appreciate the time and effort put into the vids 🤙🏿

The car selection for this update is quite nice! Loving the Infiniti and the Camry
Another change that I noticed on PS is, when you fire the Avenger turrets, it changes to a different turret, they made it the same button
Well, I actually like the interaction menu updates. There are less items in each category now. Makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier. Will this change speed runs?
I’m probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle, but I’m hyped that we can get the Cluckin Bell Van and omg the Baller S-TD only Rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
Done my first complete salvage mission. Start to finish took almost 2 hours (without knowing what the heck I was doing mind) and made GTA$350,000 from it. 
Not the worst business by a long shot and I’m sure we’ll all get quicker at doing them. 
It was great fun. They’re like mini heists with intel gathering, setup missions and tasks (4 mandatory and 2 optional) and then the final steal mission. Mine was Maze Bank Arena. It was brilliant",20,Gaming,112000,PT12M52S

And Adam never stepped foot in the war room again after that role play bit 😂
bro just sorted out Jim Miller, what a man
Jim Miller UFC 100,200 and now 300 what a Carrier he's had.
Dana’s face on 8:23 🤣🤣 I can’t cope
Aspinal should ONLY be fighting for the title at this point.
That role play def went better in your head 😂 Great interview as always bro
I really want to find someone actually still interested in the Jones v Stipe fight. Even when the fight got cancelled I was infinitely more excited about the Tom v Pav fight. 

Now that we have to wait even longer for it it’s just going to feel more and more anticlimactic by the time the fight actually comes around. 

The UFC has always moved with the times better than any other sports organisation. But on this subject this is one of those rare times that I feel they’re going in the wrong direction.
The fans want Aspinall fighting for gold.
So freaking excited for Saturday. I am fully expecting Covington to win, but I’m just so pumped for the whole card. Can’t wait to watch it.
I dont see the reasoning why Jones and Stipe ""Deserve"" to fight eachother ahead of Aspinall. Deserve is such a compicated word. Nobody deserves anything unless they earn it. How has a guy whos fought once at Heavyweight and another guy who lost his last fight years ago earned the right to be at the top of the pile? Meanwhile Aspinall is fighting anyone he can get his hands on at short notice and saving cards and he gets told to wait. Its absolutely stinks
Fair play to Catterall, he just got Jim Miller on the 300 card. Miller owes him a drink
I've never been to a UFC event and I would love nothing more than to one day go to one
Aspinall vs Miocic makes so much sense. Would be a great fight for 300
8:21 Danas face 🤣🤣🤣
Get Aspinall to the new Co Op arena in Manchester next year, will be the biggest arena in the UK
Jim Miller in UFC 300 really needs to hapoen. Been saying it for weeks.
That's a world record in itself.
Who from that era can say that today ?
Dana White has an aura that influences who ever is interviewing him, No one dares to ask him the question he don't want to answer , dude is savage.
Great interview, Adam has stepped up and become a likable face of BT UFC coverage after Dan left",17,Sports,5130000,PT19M16S

Angela has taken ""Smosh cast"" to another level in so many ways.
The way Courtney kept blatantly looking at Noah's cards 😂
I love Angela being the only person to call Keith out for being so extra about a game of uno
courtney's entire villain monologue at the end deserves an oscar
I love the Angela + Keith teamup, somehow their dual chaos cancels each other out lol
Angela truly is girl Shayne. She even came with the broken limb.
Watching Courtney win at the end was like watching a clown pull a handkerchief out of their pocket
Courtney constantly checking Noah's hand was FUNNY
Courtney did the most dramatic win on Uno ever
The way they referenced Grace Chastity in the intro makes me wish for a Smosh cameo in the hatchet field cinematic universe.
I’ve always been under the impression that every Uno game is brutal….but dang this wild
First, they broke Angela's body. Then +30 killed her spirit.
Angela just probably took the term “break a leg” too literally and broke an arm instead.
having angela play a card game with a broken arm was wild 🤣
Courtney’s +46 might be the best thing I’ve ever seen in my life 😂
Them using Angela’s nerdy prudes picture and their impressions of her is amazing
It's absolutely Noah's own fault that Courtney was so perfectly able to look at his cards 😂😂
Kortney catching on that Courtney kept glancing at Noah's hand was hilarious, loved the editing!
Angela came in with a cast and just chilled the entire video",20,Gaming,7550000,PT31M23S

This looks absolutely AMAZING. Can’t wait to play it.
Finally, the best chapter is almost here!🎉
I've always been too afraid to play this and I'm happy to report that nothing has changed after seeing this trailer 😭
Given how Poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this, I do hope she won't become this final hidden main antagonist.
I love that they're leaning more into the true horror side of things, looks fantastic
I can imagine how Matpat is excited over this trailer and of course, THE LOOOORE!
It is honestly relieving to see that Poppy Playtime is still continuing to produce since 2021
Matpat was right, the prototype body is a mix of MANY things ! I can't wait to see the release of the chapter

#Drumeo #NandiBushell #TwistedSister",1839,"Thank you so much @drumeo for inviting me on! I had the best time!
AJ Pero was a criminally underrated drummer.  Lots of people are unaware at how good he really was.
A great fresh version of a classic.

Her innocence when she says - I like how they all dressed up for the video.
Keep rocking, Nandi! Great work! 🙏🏼

she's 1000x better at this age then I'll ever be in my life.  So much talent and work
Absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer! It's truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age. I can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums. The precision, timing, and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable. A true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself!
She effin' killed it!  Her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing!  I was super impressed.  I'm not as surprised now, to see how Foo Fighters identified her skill... so long ago.  This was incredible.  No offense to Twisted Sister... but, I think she really turned it up to ""11"".
That was phenomenal. You can see how Nandi's taken all of the lessons from Chad Smith and Dave Grohl to heart. So happy to hear her keeping rock alive. I'd say her drums worked better in places than the original track, she had more fills and had some double kick in places. One of the best in this series.
This was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time. Beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 👏
Her talent just shines in this video.  What a great take on that song.
Her approach brings such a late 90s/early 00s pop-punk vibe to the whole song. If that version were released in that era, it still would have been a hit.
What I love about Nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is. You can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses. Makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that!
I love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hi-hat, that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when it's metal.
She is so impressive with not only how she plays, which is outstanding, but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly.
AJ is smiling down at this. Best series hands down. She's so effin talented 👏🏼👏🏼
Nandi is so awesome!!! What an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid. This was pure joy!!!
I gotta say….this was amazing! Nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before! WOW! Wow! Wow! 🤘🔥🙌🥁
I’m so psyched to see Nandi on here.  Love her drumming, love her energy, this is an amazing performance.  So many little things match up with her version and the original.  Can’t wait to see more of Nandi here!  I know the guys of Twisted Sister will love this.
Nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with Dave Grohl. I'm very impressed she's got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that don't overwhelm the overall song. Great work from her and I think once her GCSE's and A Levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one.
I like the way Nandi is already a better drummer than most 80s hair metal bands ever had.",27,Education,3310000,PT9M40S

I need to make a trip to New Orleans, the passion this guy has for his sandwiches and his business is heartwarming
What an amazing video. What an amazing vibe. What an amazing team and leader. I love everything about it!
Guy has that southern charm and is passionate, a real experienced GM out there hosting a show while actually helping the back of house.
“She come in looking for me, I knew she was looking for more than roast beef.” my dude had me dying 😂
This guy got to be one of the most infectious and energetic bosses out there! You can tell he truly has a passion for the food.
I am echoing what others have said .... this was a great video! Loved Justin's passion for their restaurant and the food they serve.
I always get the roast beef po-boy. I understand people that get the fried oyster or shrimp, but the roast beef is just the most sublime mess ever created.
There are so many places to get great po-boys in New Orleans, but I must say, Parkway's Surf & Turf (fried shrimp with roast beef debris and gravy) is in the upper echelon. 15 napkins minimum.
So living in New Orleans, this is my favorite po'boy place to go to! Especially for the streetcar poboy!!!! Thank you Bon Appetit for making this video and highlighting the behind the scenes of my favorite place!!
His passion for what he does is so evident.... I love watching people like him.
this place is brilliant, the guys is awesome. you can tell he aint BS, his staff must love him. Great episode!
Lived and worked in NOLA in kitchens. So much great food and Parkway has #1 poboys . Like the drive-up. Thats is a brilliant move.
justin's passion is infectious!! need me a po’boy asap
I grew up eating roast beef po' boys in southern Louisiana. Now I make them for my family and it's always a hit.
Incredible to see an owner operator so dialed in he even lives above the business to be more efficient. Will definitely visit in the future.
Looks delicious every sandwich 😋I would go there, just to try ""shrimp po boy"" ☺️Owner looks intense, like he wants to serve the best food,and runs a tight ship.👍
I want him to host a tv show based on his daily experiences in that store.
Loved how Justin weighed the sandwich and never skimped on anything. He just wants to make people happy... can't wait to go here one day!
As a restaurant person for over 20 years now working for somebody like this makes a huge difference. Great stuff!",24,Entertainment,6420000,PT21M9S

Me encanto la musica esta muy buena 😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
Estas canciones de ese año, me da tristeza y felicidad porque me recuerda a mi papá, que siempre las ponía en su tocadiscos o en la radio. Me recuerda mucho a él. Entiendo porque las escuchaba. Su infancia no fue fácil, era dura, mi abuelo no lo trataba muy bien, fue duro con él ,El desde niño trabajaba, hay que recordar que en los tiempos de antes era difícil. Una de esas contó que trabajaba en el mercado tenía 12 años y él ayudaba a una señora con su mandado para subirlo a su carro de ella. Y una de esas no sé qué pasó que se regresó por una bolsas para la señora para el mandado y ella se había ido…… Le compro ese mandado a él 😢 también nos contó que trabajaba limpiaba carros, y que mi abuelo lo mandaba a pedir dinero porque aveces no había, y tenía que caminar mucho…….. asta que tuvo 22 años y se topó aún amigo que le ofreció trabajo en la CESMP del gobierno y cambio subjdia para bien. en fin muchas cosas nos contó en los años de los 50s mi papá ahora tiene 68 años y es muy fuerte. ❤ en los 70s se casó con mi mamá. tiene su casa propia, a nosotros…. Muy bien gracias a dios.
Este canción va ser un éxito, aqui  siempre tendrás a tu fandom apoyándote te lo mereces 🫰❤️💗💚💜",10,Music,950000,PT3M50S

he's truly a legend
I think you look great, Dan! The fact you're over 30, a parent of two, and still making videos seems to have aged you a tad. You're still the same amazing gamer you were years ago. I'm almost 18 now and it doesn't feel real. Time flew by faster than I wished it would, but I wouldn't have ya any other way :)
To be fair Dan you have created such a big channel that we honestly just can’t hate anything you do because it’s just so wholesome to us, so just keep doing what your doing and we will enjoy being here with you
You never disappoint dantdm. It’s now rare for me to see Dan post something. This man needs award for being a dad and a YouTuber raising grown up children. 💙💙💙💙💙
You never disappoint, Dan
I've been dealing with lots of things such as cancer that is affecting my mum and having my niece recently deceased means alot to me thank u Dan u making a good decision for me and everyone who is struggling with this disease. Thanks to you, you have inspired millions to take your ideas and show them across the internet. Thx u Dan
Thanks for being so wholesome and inspiring! Still one of my favorite YouTubers after all these years!
Let’s just say that his content will always be loved and appreciated throughout the years.His videos always made me feel comfortable and joyful.
I can’t believe you’re balding at such an early age Dan. You did carry an entire generation
no matter what, he'll always be such a gaming legend, keep going Dan. :)
Dan is one of last people on youtube to have a title with this thumbnail, and actually deliver what was advertised. I’m glad I grew up with this guy.
as someone with a shaved head my whole life, you're taking a step in the right direction
This community is so great and wholesome, everyone is so sweet and it gives me a big smile on my face, Keep being awesome Dan.
thank you for being a great YouTube Dan! im so happy you did something you've wanted to do for a while!
looks nice! you've been around the block long enough that i don't think anything you do to your hair would actually make people mad. keep up being an awesome human, and hope you, Jem, and the boys have a nice holiday! 😊
Dan, there's little you can do to destroy the incredibly legacy you've built. Live your life to the fullest! You've done more than enough for us.
Dan is a YouTuber who raised me, and is raising even more people still. Even two of his own ❤
the amount of changes dan’s hair has gone through is beyond me
Whatever you do with your hair, you're still the man that spent years making so many people's child and teen years much brighter. Looks great!
Might have said this several times over and over, but I'm a big fan of Dan. Don't listen to the trolls, you look great! :D",24,Entertainment,28400000,PT5M33S

Yoshimitsu is ready to slice and dice the competition in #TEKKEN8!",3409,"Yoshimitsu doing Yoshimitsu things is always beautiful to watch
This man's design is always so hype
Yoshimitsu is the GOAT
Yoshimitsu's design is unique in every game he's in, and I love it everytime 😍
This is definitely one of the best Yoshimitsu designs, and ""MECHANIZED SPACE NINJA"" is just a beautiful string of words.
It's so cool that they finally incorporated his backstory of his sword into his playstyle and his outros
The design, moves, blade attacks and the attack animations are seriously insane 🤯
I like how you can see his fingers to remind you that he is human, some of his designs really push the idea of him being something else
This looks like the best version of Yoshimitsu in years aesthetically speaking and his move set looks a lot more fluid in the trailer. Let’s hope he plays as well as he looks
FUN FACT: Everyone eagerly anticipates for Yoshimitsu's design whenever a new Tekken game is announced! 😁
That. Was. AMAZING. My goodness, one of the trailers I was most eager to see and it delivered. There is absolutely nothing from him that I disliked or thought was ""meh"" that he brought with him and demonstrated as he returned. One of the best looking rage arts, and his design! It's simple yet really cool and not overly designed, just like in Tekken 3 and 4, which is the way I really like it. I think it is finally time to main him again in Tekken. I only used him a lot in Tekken 3, Tekken 4, and the Soul Calibur games.
Yoshimitsu is looking fire in this one and  also love that they included a special intro with Brian. Basically a nod back to the revenge plot from T5.
Simplesmente o personagem com o design mais diferenciado, vlw a pena esperar, perfeito d+! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yoshimitsu has always been one of my mains and this will be no different.
I love the fact that they gave yoshimitsu most of his soulcalibur moves plus his chemistry with bryan is second to none
Never a Tekken game without Yoshimitsu.
Yoshimitsu never dissapoints us 🔥🔥
I cannot wait to play him, his playstyle and design are all amazing
Tekken is pouring some absolute love in their franchise. This design is straight up 🔥
Wow...this is amazing! And what a great character Yoshimitsu is, we really missed him too much. The appearance of him between ninja and samurai is quite surprising, I think he will be one of my favorite characters like in the old days. Be careful Bryan, here we go hahaha... Thank you very much, Namco-Bandai, you are truly geniuses.",20,Gaming,1090000,PT2M26S

Thank you for making my home feel safe again! Love and miss you guys!
kris and celina is literally the female version of sam and colby, the jokes, the vibes, even the hair😂❤
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits or anything else to come around me or anyone I love while watching these videos. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything yall do
I am really glad that Colby decided to say his fear out loud because I've been struggling with the same one for the last few years. It's nice to know someone out there is also feeling uneasy because of this.. makes me feel less alone.
Honestly, Colby is so real for having that fear. It's definitely one you don't really think about, but most of us probably have.
Wildlife biologist here! That hissing in the shack sounded like an opossum to me :) other animals like marmots will hiss like that (a gutteral hiss, not the silkiness of a snake hiss). It was probably looking for bugs or rodents and upset you disturbed its hunt. ❤
Imagine being a ghost and seeing the bathtub full of water and getting all excited to take yourself a little ghostly soak so you turn the jets on and suddenly everyone freaks out 🤣
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video and i dont want this to be spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching series thank you so much for listening to our side of the story
Me, my family and my loved ones do not claim any negative energy or spirits from the video. I am praying that all of you guys watching the video will stay safe and protected!
Celina's little dance and saying ""it may have demons but its hella cute"" had me dying
I do not claim any negative energy from this video and i dont want this to be spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching series thank you so much for listening to our side of the story and for sharing yours. I do however,claim the positive energy that yall 4 have
kris and celina is literally the female version of sam and colby, the jokes, the vibes, even the hair
Am I the only one who was so engrossed and entertained watching them together, that when they pulled the curtain back and Sam jumped up (even though I KNEW something silly was about to happen) I still literally jumped, screamed, and then laughed so freakin hard at myself!! No? Just me?? Lmao.
Celina, I’m really glad you’re bringing the people who are sensitive to certain things into a positive light. I’ve been struggling with my gift since I was little and it regularly scares me some people don’t get how it effects people. Shit sucks sometimes. I’ve been following you for years and I’m proud of you. I’m still afraid to address my shenanigans even though multiple mediums have read me and called me out. Fun fact I grew up in a house in Maine with shadow people. Yes that is plural unfortunately. My mom can attest to that one it was Terrifying. this video is full of goofy sh!t tho
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits, or anything else to come around me or the one's i love while watching this series thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything you do. I'm sorry if i nade any glances or anything i shouldn't have.
Guys! I felt the energy off that banishing ritual! Powerful stuff! As a witch (and a fellow ghost investigator), I'm giving you all virtual high-fives! Ya did good!
This video is refreshingly lighthearted and wholesome after the Conjuring series.  Always love a collab between the boys and Kris and Celina!  I could watch these goofy besties just hanging out for hours",24,Entertainment,11100000,PT57M20S

Gregoria ketara berusaha mati2an memaksakan diri sekuat2nya mengatasi keterbatasan fisiknya yg emang kurang kuat. Tapi skill nya blh di bilang keren sprti TJY👍 usaha Gregor tetap patut di respect , dia kalah terutama di langkah saja yg selalu keteteran nguber yg membuat postur mukul sering jd kurang pas.  Gregor memang masih hrs terus atasi terus mslh di fisik.

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1438,"David de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade I hate how he was brushed aside.
Ten Hag in his post match said, we played well, and we didn't deserve to lose😂😂
I can't believe you actually thought they would win, Mark.  With that team?  ""We are Manchester United""?  Yep, a mid-table team with horrible players and management.  It will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4.
But Mark, you have to admit that other than Martinez, Ten Hag’s signings have been just terrible and very expensive
The problem is that because ETH rates players like Onana, Antony, Mount and Mctominay, I don’t rate him.
Karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like it's gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
Figure it out, ETH wanted Onana,he got him . Not the Glazers, ETH .Accountability!
What does accountability of Ten Hag mean if a possibility of firing him isn’t on the table?
Manchester United are the first Premier League side to finish bottom of their UCL group on two occasions (Also 2005/06).  Record breakers. Also the first English side to concede 15 goals in UCL.
Onana has been a revelation in goal….a terrible revelation that Ten Hag has no f**kin’ clue. Cheers Erik!😂
For me it's Mainoo, simple as that...The kid's got a needle eye for a through ball and he's brave enough to attempt it. We need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him, we can't be playing side to side long balls all the effin time, like why is this kid not constantly starting?!!!!!
The biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
We pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
David is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment!!
Ten Hag is sacking himself! Playing Mctominay, keep starting Onana, not subbing off Bruno. Kmt. If he gets the sack, he deserves it  He can blame no one but himself. Kmt.
A lot of people don’t wanna hear it but Bruno ruins the team. It’s not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much. Either a terrible pass or a terrible shot. Occasionally he’ll slap a beauty but most of the time he’s a losing factor. Either way he’s way too risky. If you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position. His attitude stinks. Complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball. Or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in. Honestly he has to go. And mctominay 
Don’t get me started on mctominay
You’ll blame anyone and everyone other than Erik Ten Hag for the team he manages.
As you sit and listen to Mark defend ETH's job after this, just remember Mark unironically believed Manchester United would WIN the CL this season. He said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had.
If you go from believing we can win the competition, only to come 4th in a favourable group, then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable. 

ETH spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at LCB as an excuse for his ego trip with Varane and then tonight kept him at LCB while Evans played RCB. He constantly talks about standards but Onana, who has now led us to being the English team who has conceded the most goals in a CL group stage ever, got to play every game despite costing us points. The sooner this guy is gone the better.
I don’t see why we signed bayindir when he hasn’t played a game, surely he’s good enough to play cup games
They sanctioned Onana's  deal because they believed in Ten Hag who is now showing us how clueless he is we need to get rid of him with the immediate effect",17,Sports,1790000,PT39M41S

The Kelly Clarkson Show is the uplifting daytime destination for humor and connection featuring Emmy-winning talk show, Grammy-winning artist and America’s original idol, Kelly Clarkson.",627,"Kelly backing away from the mic in order not to overpower him. That’s one of the many reasons I love her.
The reason Kelly easily complements her duet partners and even oftentimes ""hold back"" is because she has no ego. She's completely confident in herself as a vocalist and artist that her principal goal in that moment is create beautiful art with another artist. Many can learn a lesson for two from Kelly.
So much respect to Kelly for truly taking the background on this song with Teddy and letting him shine. What a great collab!
Kelly actually giving teddy the stage and not shadow him is top respect ❤️🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 They need to go on head and recut that in the studio!!!
Kelly is the QUEEN of letting her guests shine, while also harmonizing with them PERFECTLY and also finding some great moments for her own voice to shine through like the AMAZING gift that it is.  Utter perfection.  And she looks so amazing, glad she's healthy and happy!  NYC is such a perfect fit for her!
Been watching Teddy since the plain 'ol white walled garage sessions. Love them together! Kelly knows good when she hears it.
More people need to collaborate with Kelly - her voices compliments EVERYONE - sign of true talent.
This duet inspired me to further explore who Teddy Swims is, that's how flawless this performance was. They should go to the studio, record and release this as a duet single. Absolutely amazing!!!
Teddy is absolutely fabulous and with Kelly in the mix that was just like heaven. ❤
Kelly can do no wrong <3
Love Teddy's soulful voice, and Kelly knows just how to complement him with her fabulous yet not overpowering background vocals and harmonies. Terrific performance ❤
The admiration she has for other artists and grace she gives them while performing is very rare in this business!
Waited two hours after watching the show and listening to the music video 7 times just to bring it back to the TV collaboration that I've become obsessed with ❤❤😂😂. Massive love to Kelly for putting Teddy on because this was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
Her harmonies are slept on… She can compliment and let people shine, no ego… love 💕 love 💕 love 💕!
🔥 🔥 🔥 dang they need to write a single together
This is a duet I have been dying to hear!!!  Teddy is the bomb and Kelly.... well...she is Kelly. Nuf said. BRAVO!!!
I’ve been a big fan of Teddy’s for years but every time I hear this song I still get goosebumps
Kelly is a class act. Pulls back to give the the duet partner the moment. Generosity at its utmost.
What? I have this on repeat several times can’t get enough. That sounded spiritual, sexy, soulful. I’m in love. These two need to make a duo album for sure. They can make beautiful music in more ways than one. Never know!",22,People & Blogs,2560000,PT3M38S

Now he knows what it’s like to play the Chiefs 😂😂😂
The call was 100% correct. Chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
For those who didn't watch SNF tonight...

This penalty was called once in 2021, twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season. 

So it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials. And the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasn't some conspiracy. 

Mahomes' reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled.
There has been a lot of bad officiating this season. 

This was an example of good officiating.
Hes looking at the baaaaaaaall , and still line up off side....WoW!
Chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldn´t happen at such an important point of the game.  We should go back and see what the Eagles think about the holding call in the Super Bowl last year... Chiefs weren´t complaining then...
Never understood why ANY player, whatever the position, would line up offside.  These guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do.  You don't even have to move your bod, just use a couple of neck muscles, turn your head and LOOK.  Unbelievable.
Because the Chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years, Mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him. The bills won this game and they don’t even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called. Mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs, he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral 🙌
Still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
If you're lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder (around the defensive lineman standing next to you) to see the ball.  You're offsides.  How did Toney not realize the ball and center was behind him?
Doesn't matter how many times it was called before. You know the rules, offsides is offsides, end of story. He could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches, he knew the game was at stake, and if he didn't know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known.
He was looking right at the ball. How could he not know to move back? That's on him.
What's shocking is that Toney didn't drop the lateral from Kelce.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral
Ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
As a Broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
It does look like offsides but what a cool play. The Chiefs are an amazing team.
Geez that was a great throw, a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting TD…. Would have been fun in highlight reels, Kelce probably can’t reenact that last-second pass, what a shame!!",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S

#UFC",2367,"The fact that Wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
Always rooting for Wonderboy. He’s a great role model, love seeing him teach the kids karate.
If the UFC made a show about Wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome I'd never miss an episode
Thompson is unreal... he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
This was one of the most positive and happy embedded I've seen! Happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week. They'll need it for the presser
Such a heartwarming embedded. Even someone I’m not a fan of like Paddy, he’s a good dude at heart. Good to see.
I'm proud of wonderboy's facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight, but ensuring that they get their homework done.
Wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act. It’s honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
1:23 I respect Wonderboy so much🥋💯. He knows to his core all his skills took time, years & years of honing. What he’s teaching these children & by simply picking them up from school? A world class fighter!!! You have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds. We all got in this art from watching movies. I can’t imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training🙌🏾🙌🏾🥋🥋🥋💯💯💯
Since everyone is talking about how great Wonderboy is…. 

Right after the Luque fight, I ran into him at Disneyland. I was a single rider on the Smuggler’s Run ride, and ended up with him and his family. I was so stoked! I told him my wife can’t ride because she is with my 2 year old son, and he said “well, you’re part of our family for this ride now!”

After the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son. He was seriously the nicest guy I’d ever met! It was something I’ll never forget.
Wonderboy really is that dude. Great human being
Why can’t Wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years?… he’s one of the nicest guys on the planet, and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
The fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing I’ve ever seen
We need more fighters like Wonderboy in gyms everywhere. A good man is hard to find.
Brandon Royval and Stephen Thompson seem like genuinely good guys/role models. Really nice to see that.
Paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell he's a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan ❤
I’m rooting for Royval and Edwards! 
But it ain’t going to be easy 😤
What a great card to end the year.
Paddy’s honestly a great dude. Fighter or not, the guys got my admiration.
I know UFC doesn't wanna take the focus away from their Fight Night cards, but you really should build up these big PPV events for more than just a week. Hype usually takes a bit of time to build properly.
Wonderboy has always been a treat on embedded, he's a true role model of what a martial artist should be, he's so humble, true class act 👏👏👏👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT8M43S

R-Truth jumped by Judgment Day after calling out Damian Priest, trying to kick out JD
https://youtu.be/7zlojlolpUI

WWE ON FOX
https://www.youtube.com/c/WWEonFOX",527,"Truth just became a JD member, he got jumped in.
Barrett: ""That' no way to treat a fellow member of Judgement Day"" 😂.... even Wade is on Truth's side
Finn started laughing when Truth dissed JD McDonough. Truth can make almost anyone break character. Hah hah!
R-Truth needs to be apart of The Judgement Day
R truth is just the kind of uplifting personality we need in the JD
Truth has been so epic since his return. An ageless legend.
Is a shake-up for The Judgment Day on the horizon? 👀
I love Finn’s very genuine “I like him” and then he gives him the lightest kick during the jumping and then backs off while the others do it, feels very “ah come on guys, do we have to jump the funny man”
Bruh he had Finn breaking character and he ain't even hiding it lmao
Finn broke character when he said JD needs to go lol
Dang I was really hoping for R Truth to somehow become a member of the Judgement Day. Would've been funny if he became a member because of Damian having a soft spot for Truth lol.
R-Truth joining Judgment Day could be like when Sami joined the BL. It'd be content
R-Truth going to the hall of fame
They really could have had a Bloodline Sami type of storyline with this leading to R-Truth having a run that can actually be taken seriously.
Damian struggles not to break around Truth 😂😂😂😂
That Julius creed move on JD and Dom was sick.
""JD, you gotta get out. No one likes you""

Gets me everytime 😅
R-Truth is a hall of famer, idc what anyone says. His ability to CONSTANTLY entertain the crowd with whatever gimmick WWE gives him is amazing. Remember this dude entertained the crowd for months with an imaginary friend. He made the 24/7 championship worth watching, the moment they took it away from him, nobody cared about it anymore and they had to retire it. He's good on the mic, and he's lowkey good in the ring, just never really gets a chance to show it. I know he doesnt have the accolades, but hes a true entertainer.
Finn been laughing all day 😂
Lmao at 3:24 Finn saying ""What's up"" with Truth and the crowd and JD getting upset about it. WWE really is a variety show incorporating so many types of entertainment in one. This was a great segment that captures the best of what we all love about storytelling, great characters and WWE. Additionally, R-Truth is probably the only active guy on the roster who can get sympathy from the crowd. You can almost feel the energy shift when he decides to get in the ring, and you feel the impending doom cause you know he's walking into getting beat up lol he's such a great act, and everyone here did well in this segment!",17,Sports,1480000,PT5M15S

Music by Kevin MacLeod: https://incompetech.com/",2540,"Missy is just literally the chillest creature out of everyone in this game. She’s so Kumbaya and I need that. I wish I had her energy
Given how Poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this, I do hope she won't become this final hidden main antagonist.
The fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is low-key respectable. 👏Great job man.
I actually theorize that we won't meet Catnap as this giant monster right away, but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat. However, once he learns that Poppy apposes the Prototype, it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form. Keep in mind that Catnap can adjust the proportions of his body, he's a sizeshifter.
This game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
The character that is being tortured and strapped is Dog-Day, the leader of the Smiling Critters. Dog-Day is also the one of the screenshot, coming out of a large tube. We see him chasing the player on the trailer as well, coming out of that same tube. I believe that the guy on the phone saying ""This is what he does to heretics."", etc, is Dr. Harley ""The Doctor"" Sawyer, from Project Playtime. I am not sure, but his voice is surely the same voice actor. The Dr. was also the one responsible for the monsters, the project being called: ""The Bigger Bodies Innitiative"".
The little critters were so cute in a creepy way. Seeing them with long, human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel, for me, that made them look scarier than the plushie version. I also noticed the stitches on the arms. If they are working with the prototype, maybe it helped make them bigger/taller and safer. We know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys.
i'll be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 🤣
The scratch on the wall fully says ""FATE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE"". Also. That character we see tied up actually looks like the dog. It has the same ears and if you look closely, that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth. This character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us. Or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told. Also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists. Making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us.
I think 19:01 says ""PEACE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE."" I'm really excited for the game though! Thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us, Mike!
Chapter 3 is lookin very good so far! Also massive props to Mob Entertainment, just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story, just can’t wait to see it now! XD
Man I can't even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see CatNap, and something tells me that this is going to be the SCARIEST chapter ever
My theory on Nightmare Huggy is that it's the same one from chapter one, but under the influence of Catnap, who saw how obedient Huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again - through Catnap's orders.
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went 'wild'  or rabid.  The fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting. Cant wait to see  who's the real bad guy or something
Given how much information is in this next chapter, I wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe they'll do one more and then end the game. It seems like we're going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so I would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype. (Also I just thought of this, but it's possible the player is a toy themselves. If they were a bigger bodies toy, they would be working in the factory, have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged)
One of the biggest things I cannot wait for, is seeing how the player and Poppy interact with Kissy. But why do I have this strange feeling, like red flags are being raised, that she’ll sacrifice herself to save Poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter?

Idk, I’d be happy if Kissy lived, but I guess we will have to wait and see.
Yo, the voice lines from Poppy, it sounds so chilling. She’s actively trying to save people? And KISSY MISSY, yes!!! I knew she would be involved, that would actually be so cool. I really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people, not just “you were secretly the bad guy”
one important aspect is that the smiling cirtters or atleast catnap are made entirely of a special fluid material that gives them the ability to manifest their form. they can be as small as a mouse, or as tall as a giraffe
Knowing kissy will help us in this chapter, I can’t help but fathom that she’ll probably face off against against catnap near the end of the chapter to maybe buy us some time to escape.
Geez, Catnap is huge and awesomely and genuinely terrifying. And seeing Kissy and Poppy helping us is very interesting",20,Gaming,2110000,PT21M8S

Upset over a blatant penalty. Man if Mahomes reacted like this over that. Imagine how he would have reacted if the Chiefs got the same treatment the Bills got in the Bills Eagles game. Refs totally screwed them.
After looking at the replay, our guy clearly lined up off-sides. The refs had to call it. Same type of dumb-ass move that we did in the AFC championship several years ago when one of you defensive players lined up off side when we intercepted Brady to nullify the play and lose the game. Mahomes needs to aim his anger in the right direction - his own man. We deserved to lose and will cont. to do so with this lousy offense. Too bad - wasting a very good defense this year.
Just a straight up fair amd square loss for the chiefs unfortunately they had an offsides that seemingly cost them the win or atleast lead, really unprofessional and pathetic that your starting quarterback has a temper tantrum on the sidelines yelling at the refs for doing their jobs well
The Chiefs had their chances to win and they didn't get it done.
classic. Man gets so many calls his way over the years, gets a few called against him and he has an aneurism.
All I have to say is that Chiefs fans got a little taste of what its like to be a Bills fan for the last 30 years.
Legend has it that Mahomes is still screaming on the sideline.
Via Adam Schefter on Twitter,

Chiefs’ HC Andy Reid was not pleased that officials did not warn him that Kadarius Toney was lined up offsides the way they have in the past. About the call, the normally mild-mannered Reid said, “It's a bit embarrassing for the National Football League for that to take place.”
I get great joy from seeing the refs treat the chiefs like every other team in the league
This was amazing to see! About time the refs make the correct call and stop making these calls for mahomes.
To be honest, there was still over a minute and the Bills had timeouts to score a TD. No guarantee that offsides call not being called would have meant a Chiefs win.
Ironic. Patrick mahomes and chiefs fans realizing what every other team has to go through when facing the chiefs.
I want to watch a football game not a every time Kelsie catches the ball we have to cut to Taylor Swift’s reaction.
There is absolutely a major problem with officials tainting games with either questionable calls or non calls  and completely subjective  penalties which on some occasions determines the outcome of the game. 

This wasnt one of them, even Stevie Wonder can see Toney was way offsides here.
No amount of cursing and yelling can deflect from the fact that they lost. Mahomes just made himself look like a spoiled unsportsman like loser.
As a Chiefs fan, I'm embarrassed and mortified by the behavoir Mahomes displayed. It shows how badly winning has gone to his head and how inflated his ego is that he can't handle losing with some ounch of dignity, even if he thought someone else was in the wrong.
Watched them take 3 games from us in the past cuz of calls like these. I still remember a game were Mahomes got intercepted 4 times and they all came back. Theyve been spoiled for too long now they think they should let little mistakes like these slide.
I love how Patrick Mahomes can throw a tantrum in front of the world but when I do it at work I need to grow up 😂
Chiefs right now are in a classic post Superbowl era. After winning, we’re gonna go through some tough struggles (mainly with our receivers) but hopefully we still stay strong and are alright going forward",17,Sports,137000,PT2M11S

So much so that the studio shutdown and is likely running with the money...

Special thanks to @BigfryTV for his gameplay
HollyRex's clip https://www.twitch.tv/hollyrex/clip/BombasticHyperAlmondItsBoshyTime-YK9Mh_v-W17bk6cM",2684,"Steam has taken the game down.  You can no longer buy it.  Apparently Steam also holds money for 30 days.  They're also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played.  So it looks like the developers jumped ship too early.
Luckily! Steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark. This was too much of a Scam even for Steam.
Players and valve should put these guys in court
One thing I have learned over the years is ""there are people defending it"" means absolutely nothing in the world of video games.    They love abuse.
What people have to learn:
NEVER believe trailers. 
NEVER pre-oder anything.
Wait till the game is fully released.
This is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on (Or rather orchastrated) this game. So people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
Not to mention Fntastic used ""volunteers"" in their development process. They asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received ""participation certificates"" and ""free codes"" for the game. Every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it.
The fact that the studio literally said, “shit happens” is ….wow
Level- “I gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isn’t that easy.”
*Seconds later*
Also Level- “Random guy on Reddit is recreating the game by himself.” 😂 💀
I remember watching you when I was in middle school and you made airsoft videos! I’m happy to see you’re still at it man keep up the hard work 🔥
Imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be.
Keep an eye on The Ranchers, it was announced at TGA a year ago and is going down the same route - even after a successful kickstarter.
I have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens. regardless of whether or not Fntastic is actually in the red or not, other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity. expect to see people learning from the errors made by Fntastic and performing scams better. keep an eye out everyone, do NOT buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear. be cautious and stay safe, and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
The frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam. This was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release. Yet they bought it anyway. It's pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time.
My biggest issue is I was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self. But every video and trailer I watched I kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it. But the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
I always follow the rule of: If it looks and sounds too good to be true. It probably is. Especially when they never show real in game footage.
The gaming community should keep an eye on these people. Apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to Eight Points. I feel they'll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
Been appreciating your efforts since BF3.  Thank you for what you do.
Imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody. I bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year. That’s making the game actually playable and improving on things too.
I think this is a good thing, long term, for consumers. If this doesn't get people to wise up and quit shelling out money for games without a good idea of what they're getting (something with a lot of third-party gameplay videos) then there's no hope for video gamers.",20,Gaming,1940000,PT10M53S

 #gaming #lego #fortnite",583,"EXTRA TIP: Carry 6 planks with you ALWAYS. You can 1. Craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools (including the grappler which makes it actually useful) or 2. craft a bed once you get to the right town level, which as already stated is good for respawns (alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you)
Hiya Guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold😅

*Regarding Tip 12 with the Grappler*
Thank you everyone for the comments i wasn't aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 🤣
It may get patched soon though...

Really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code ""RUGG"" in the item shop!
Thank you all so much for the support 😎
More LEGO Fortnite videos will be coming later this week
MAJOR TIPS, READ THIS!
Something to keep in mind, if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest, it resets the grappler back to 10 uses. It makes the grappler very work getting.

Another tip, if you take the barrels of TNT (found near old broken down buildings)  and throw them into clusters of trees, or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while i’m only at 3rd village lvl. great video as always!
For heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
If you keep a hearty charm on, it can negate low temp or high temp damage. You remain at full HP, you get the temp hearts. So long as your at the first layer of hot/cold, the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts.
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10. It usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used. I also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return. Edit: just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up.
Suggestion: I explored my map a bit with nothing on me. Whenever I came across something interesting I would pick up small stones nearby, make a marker and place it there. That way I could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything. Then whenever I'm ready I'd gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that I can immediately go to.
Great tip with the grappler, you don't have to break the chest, put it in and take it out, unfortunately not the same for tools
As of now, when it comes to dying of starvation, heat, or cold, there is a way to negate all of them with one item. It allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though I took fire damage the entire time. There is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if you're already full health, and it regenerates itself very quickly, meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation, heat, or cold, it'll regenerate it self. This allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game, especially in regards to those desert caves.
MORE TIPS: 1. Instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools, just craft a “traditional counter” under “counters” as it only costs 8 wood. 

2. The grappler’s uses can be refreshed just like your tools, except it’s even easier. You don’t even need to break whatever chest/counter you’ve built. Just throw it in a storage thing, take it out, and it’s refreshed.
Thanks for the great tips.

My tip is for people starting a new server in Survival, set up a different server with the same seed in Sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town.
I actually would suggest making a grappler. It got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit👍 7:51
I don’t know if anyone said this yet but you don’t actually need cool headed charms for the desert, if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you don’t lose your temporary hearts, and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back.
You can find sand shells at the beach/tropical coast areas. Access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations.
CRAFT THE GRAPPLER! it only sucks because it has 10 uses, but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell, the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as there’s so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse, make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
#2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime. its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly.
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect.
Heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers (assign them to threading) if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
I would say it’s for sure worth making the grappler, just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land. You can do the durability glitch w/ the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when You’re fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
Fun fact: You can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out. + aim at the highest point of a tree and it’ll work perfectly with the glider!",20,Gaming,287000,PT9M16S

Gotta say, as a Giants fan, we haven’t had a game this fun all season. Screw the tank I love to see my team win a good game.
I went through so many different emotions this game, being a giants fan I’m used to them losing a heartbreaker feels good for them to be on the other side of it..
I love Tommys dad that man is enjoying it his son is winning games for the New York Football Giants I just love that guy. You can see the joy in his face nobody can take that from him.. 💪
One of Tommy Devito’s best performances I have ever seen. He was playing especially well against the Packers defense today. I hope he goes far in his career and continues to be a starter for the Giants.
That throwback of giants 🔥
Lmao, that official getting knocked down then getting back up to signal touchdown was absolutely hilarious. What a legend.
I gotta say Devito is really settling in with the offense.

He seems much more confident in the pocket and also when scrambling. And one thing I think we all found out tonight is the kid has a cannon for an arm. 

Even if DJ is sidelined starting next year due to the Achilles injury, an entire offseason of him working with the primary group of receivers/offense may yield huge dividends for the Giants.

He's got the pocket presence to know when to bail out, throw on the run and when needed he pulls it down and can run it very effectively. 

This is going to be a VERY interesting offseason with the way this kid is playing. You can see how the team (on offense and defense) is really responding to his energy and enthusiasm.
I was at this game tonight, and honestly, I don’t even care how the rest of this season goes. That was an amazing game (but very stressful holy), and just an amazing night. Future is hopefully looking bright big blue 🔴🔵
4 weeks ago the giants were 2-8. Under shurmur, mcadoo and judge this team crawls up and dies. For daboll they have gone out with a 3rd string QB, won 3 straight with a chance at wildcard. This is a sign of a GREAT COACH who has and is building something special
I’m not even a Giants fan but I was all over on this game lol. Good game!
I was all about the tank last month but then this kid Tommy D came along and proved to me that playing for pride means so much. Haven’t had this much fun with a 5-8 record ever. Thanks Big Blue, just keep fighting.
Titans fan here.  How the heck were these two games so similar?  Crazy but fun.  Way to go, G-Men
Huge respect for the Giants from a Cowboys fan😊
What a game for Kayvon! He had a strip and recovery on Love, a bat down at the line, and constant QB pressure all just in the first half
Congrats to the Giants and their fans. You earned that one. And as a life long Lions fan I say- Thank You.
As a Bears fan and a University of Illinois alum; Way to go Giants!!!
I am a Steeler fan, but I was screaning my head off last night for the Giants. Gutsy, gutsy, play, scrambling by the young QB, WOW!
What a clutch throw from DeVito and what a route ran by Robinson to seal this win. Exciting ending🎉
As a Giants fan, this now looks like a real team, fighting together and cherishing for joint accomplishments. And DeVito has a good arm and runs well, he is also showing character and personality in a very tough environment.  Mamma mia!",17,Sports,12300000,PT15M34S

So happy to see YouTube sponsoring this video! You definitely deserve it, so proud of how far you've come. Hope you take the time to appreciate what you've built now and then.
I bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign, and it's absolutely amazing. I used it for a few hours on the 4th of July and had no issues. I didn't even have to refill it
Oh my Sweet Celestia I love the logo design with aperture science.

And I'd say it's accurate because you guys are the embodiment of ""Science is about WHY NOT?!""

Also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
Fun personal experience: for about a year, I worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with Class 10 clean rooms. No perfume, cologne, makeup, or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there. And no skin exposed. Everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed, and goggles that even had small air filters in them.

James I've gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode. This episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that I've been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today. I sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team. Def bought a mini-sabre too.😊
Not a starwars fan. More of a pirates of the caribbean guy. But I loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic. It's an amazing project, with an amazing team!
I know no one will see this, but I just want to say how amazing you guys are. From your Garage to the H.E.R.C facility I've watched every video. I've forgotten how long or at what amount of people I subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago. But I want to thank you guys for everything you're doing, pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers, chemists, physicists and rocket scientists. Keep up the amazing work, can't wait for the 'We Amputated this Guy's Limbs and turned him into Darth Vader' video. But seriously, you guys are awesome.
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists. been watching for a very long time (around 4 years). GOODLUCK HACKSMITH!
I am curious as to how they'll manage sabers clashing. It's been long theorized(and more or less confirmed in rebels) that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact. Maybe they'll be able to utilize something to that regard?
I love how casually he said ""let's play with liquid oxygen"" immediately after telling us how dangerous it is. Exactly what I'd expect from a sci-engineering/infotainment channel.
How far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
While watched you earlier you were just making Marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
Now , the hacksmith is like an industry
Too happy for you my man
Keep going
Hacksmith is doing something, that even large companies wouldn't do. Big respect
The team at Hacksmith Industries actually do things that most people don’t even think of. It’s crazy 🤯.
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational. Maybe you're less stressed now or something, but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends.
I truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility. You can see engineering past, present and future in your labs.

It really was iconic you could feel it watching it. Devin earned my respect
Now everyone can see why he needed extra 5lbs! Dude looked like a zombie before, drained af!
Looks so much healthier & energetic now!
Really impressed with what Haney has done so far. He looks unbeatable at 140. I really want to see him in there with teo and tank Davis to see who’s the best
Devin fought his best fight that I've ever seen. He's so accurate and quick with his shots. He punished Regis easily
Devin Haney is everything we wished Adrian Broner would be, dude is on a path of greatness 😊
This is like the FIRST perfect fight I've seen and Devin is waaay nicer with his hands that I thought.  He fought a PERFECT fight. He's a problem. I can't wait to see another of his fights, if he fights like this💪💯
A masterclass. Even without a stoppage Haney fought a perfect fight. He was already that guy but the stock just went up even higher.
Remarkable performance by Haney... Simply ELITE That night. Props to Prograis for Not quitting and not making any excuses after his loss. Haney was just on another level...
Absolutely amazing experience for my first time ever going to be a boxing event! The Bay showed out and so did Haney!🔥👊🏽
I'll definitely admit that I always thought Devin Haney was boring but I know that he is a great boxer with superb technical ability and skills. He definitely showed his worth last night, and I didn't go in expecting a knockout, but he completely outclassed the other man. I didn't figure his power with translate well at a higher weight class but it seems like his shots had more oomf!
It was one of the best performance I have seen in boxing this year.  Thank you, Haney, for producing a helluva performance 👏.
Haney’s accuracy is amazing. He’s so precise idk why anyone calls him boring.
Helluva performance, happy I got to experience it live. We are definitely entering the Devin Haney era!
Haney has improved a lot, he seems more technical than normal, taking care of every blow and every step, that is the essence of boxing.
Barely any holding, stayed in front, displayed his power with a knock down and making Regis stumble twice, complete shut out without taking much damage. Masterclass performance.
Devin Haney is everything we wished Adrian Broner would be, dude is on a path of greatness
I expected Haney to win a competitive fight, with a few scares along the way but he completely dominated Regis. Such a masterclass performance. So much technical brillance in this fight by Haney.
He def went in there and put on a iconic outing against a champ..much respect 💯
It was one of the best performance I have seen in boxing this year.  Thank you, Haney, for producing a helluva performance .",17,Sports,3730000,PT9M4S

About Vanderpump Rules:
As a mentor and confidant to the group, Lisa is working to restore some peace between two feuding exes as she attempts to provide perspective. Lisa is refocusing her expertise on opening a new restaurant in Lake Tahoe and continuing her success with additional ventures in Las Vegas.   

Ariana’s life was turned upside down after a devastating breakup, but she’s determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Although she still shares a home with her ex, Ariana is moving on and dating a new long-distance boyfriend. While working to open the doors to her and Katie’s sandwich shop, Something About Her, Ariana is embracing the countless opportunities that have come her way.
  
Recently proclaimed #1 guy in the group, James’ friendships within the circle are stronger than ever and his DJ career is booming. He bought a house in the Valley and is settling into suburban life with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, along with their cat and a dog from James’ past.
  
With more distance from her divorce, Katie is exploring life as a single woman and dating, even if her pursuits strike too close to home for her ex-husband, Tom. A previous indiscretion comes to light and threatens to upend her and Scheana’s renewed friendship as well as her cordial post-divorce relationship with Tom.
  
Lala is still in the midst of a challenging custody battle, but being the best mom to Ocean remains her priority. Lala explores fertility treatments and looks for a sperm donor as a single mother. She finds an unlikely connection with Tom Schwartz, forming a friendship that neither saw coming, but creating tension between her and the rest of the girls as her forgiveness for the Toms grows.
  
Celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary, Scheana and husband Brock are struggling to connect as they leave the honeymoon stage and settle into their life with a toddler. Scheana works on new music as a way to express herself. She finds herself straddling the lines in the sand within the group as she navigates her relationships with her longtime friends, and feuding exes, Ariana and Tom.
  
In the aftermath of a scandal that changed his romantic relationships, dynamics within the group and the success of his businesses, Sandoval is working on bettering himself. In a fragile state, he focuses on repairing the foundations of his friendships. When he isn’t on the road touring with his band, Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he and Ariana live under the same roof ... locked in a stalemate for the house.
  
Tom is mending a challenged friendship after taking the heat for his part in his best friend’s shocking deception. Embracing a new identity, Tom bleaches his hair, evades exclusivity with a friend-potentially-turned-girlfriend, and winds up in a surprising love triangle with a new flame and his ex-wife.

Lala is such a mind spin. First she loves Ariana, then she dsnt, then she goes hard for her at the reunion, now, she’s resentful. With friends like these, who needs enemies
Lala is jealous that her stuff with Randall didn't get her what Arianna is getting because of Tom cheating
This is why it’s EMMY nominated!!!!! 🎉🎉 omg thank you Bravo for bringing back VPR soon ♥️😗
They are living together, because Ariana did not take Lisa’s advice to not allow Tom to take a second mortgage out on their house for his bar
Lala is a joke. She used Scandoval when it first happened to grab herself some attention by constantly dragging Tom and being Ariana's friend. Since Ariana suddenly got flooded with offers, endorsements etc her tune has changed and she is a bitter Betty because of all that attention she got. The true Lala once again comes out. The jealously is off the charts and that is not a friend.
Lala thought she was going to be the damsel in distress and Ariana hijacked her moment😂😂😂
Wow.
Just..... wow.
There should never be any question of whether or not there's a next season of Vanderpump.  It seems there'll always be one.
Wow.
And if this next season isn't as intriguing as it looks, kudos to the editors!
Wow…sounds like a lot of jealousy going on…congrats to Ariana getting the job to play Roxie Hart in “Chicago” on BROADWAY!!!!!! Hope I can get tickets!
We all know Lala only supported Ariana because it got her likes and more screen time. She understands the assignment of reality tv
sooooo ready for this .. lol literally been binge watching the older seasons
Tom is the one that doesn’t want to sell the house. He is the one that does not want to give up ownership. Ariana said so on Chicks in the Office
I’m glad the shows outside of housewives are getting their recognition. They have always been lit, its some of you that are late to the party.
Holy shit, these people (and the producers) never fail to deliver. Looks awesome 🎉
I’m still rooting for Ariana. To have to partner of over 10 years cheat on you with one of your close friends is a big deal and if companies want to give her deals than so be it. Good for her!
not surprised scheana cheated. everyone seems to forget she had an affair with brandi's ex when him and brandi were still married. she's disgusting
Can't wait to see the new season
I’m so glad i see Jax on the show I hope he comes back. What happened to Kristen wasn’t she supposed to return this season?
This is why it’s EMMY nominated!!!!!  omg thank you Bravo for bringing back VPR soon ️
I think the producers this season are BRINGING it. All these scenes are cut at the perfect point.",22,People & Blogs,2610000,PT2M41S

What was once a highly anticipated zombie survival MMO, (with hundreds of thousands of sales, and a multi-year marketing hype cycle...) is now a historic example of just how easily a game can be used to fleece  its customers. 

The Day Before will serve as a long remembered example of why marketing cannot be believed, and why Early Access video games are to be treated with caution.

#thedaybefore #scam #fntastic",1922,"The drama around this game was millions of times more entertaining than the game itself. I'm almost sad it's over. Seriously this is more like a crypto rug pull than a studio closure.
This was a total social experiment and in some ways quite hilarious to prove a point that people will buy trash and be happy.
The fact that hundreds of thousands of players actually bought such an obvious scam is the saddest part. Expect a lot more similar scams coming soon.
Most brain dead defenders of this game are like, it's not a scam, you got a 'product'.  Yes, when I buy Chevy Camero and they give me a Ford Festiva, I'm like, well they did give me a 'product'.
These trash and overhyped companies need to face multi-million dollar lawsuits for false advertising.
I get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games. 
It honestly feels like everywhere I look there is a scam.
This game was an AI generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
Four days. wow.
That has to be some kind of record. They didn't even TRY to hide it, that's how confident they were that they could get away with it. (And they pretty much have)
Four days... Unbelievable.
This is so blatantly a scam that I'm actually curious if this would qualify as criminal.
Like we all know that at least in America 'false advertising' will never actually be prosecuted, but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme... Also who wants to bet that those 'server issues' at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund?
As I said in other threads, they met their contractual agreement to release a game. They send their volunteers a boilerplate ""thank you"" email, pay their ""investors"" and whatever is left they'll pocket without legal ramifications. Can't get money from a stone so by closing up shop they're effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investors/creditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have. 

They used the hype of TDB to generate a trickle of income through Prop Night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates.

At this point Steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue. 

They pretty much have to at this point.
It's been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip - folks are claiming it was built using the $300 ""American City Packs (Bundle)"" which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95% of the in-game world would suggest is accurate. It's also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the $65 ""Survival Game Kit V2"", which is where the in-game inventory mechanics all come from.
Modern game made for modern gamers.. you all deserve each other

This was so obvious from day 1. Too bad people still gave them money.
Watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly I can’t fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
Shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming, which is that I almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the *actual* product is instead of the dressed-up version seen in trailers and marketing.
Personally, I think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry. These kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported, and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing.
It would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release.
Imagine if you were one of those volunteers thinking they had a hand in something great, and find out later the boss was scamming
This has been my favorite game for the last two years. Not because I was excited for it, but because it’s just been a rollercoaster of bad PR and terrible decisions that led to what everyone knew from the beginning -that this was a scam!
I will forever thank this game for providing us with some of the funniest (and much deserved) rant reviews on YouTube.  What the developers did sucks but I haven't laughed this much in years.  These reviews are priceless.",20,Gaming,673000,PT12M3S

In this Minecraft redstone video, we take a look at how to build giant Minecraft flying machines. Minecraft slimeblock flying machines have been a hobby of mine for years, and now I'm doing a Minecraft tutorial on how to build Minecraft flying machines. From simple minecraft flying machines, to adding complexities, to creating walking minecraft machines. This covers how to build a walking house in Minecraft, walking Minecraft robots, and more!

Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThatMumboJumbo",1772,"As another comment pointed out, you now need to have scar and grian try to watch this and build their own giant walking machines
Mumbo, you should make a machine that retracts fence posts,
Just in case you’re being chased down by a warden 😂
I like Mumbo’s concept of a basic loop, and a “jumbled” loop. However, instead of jumbled loop, I think it should be called a Jumbo loop.
if it is soo simple, Get Grian and Scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
It is kinda funny to see how closely Mumbo’s three design rules parallel the design principles I’m learning as an engineering undergrad
I've never really gotten that into redstone, so I'm genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along! Flying machines always mystified me, but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes *so* much sense! Kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it!
I love when we get Mumbo videos like these - feels like the balance between Theory and Tutorial that makes it really easy (for me personally) to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards. It doesn't ruin the magic of how you make them; far from it, it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand HOW COOL YOUR STUFF IS.
yknow, for tight timing things like this, i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod - or recording in the 1.20 snapshots.
That way you'd have access to tick freeze and tick step, which would make these explanations even better imo!
This was actually really informative. I've built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas, but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots. Thank you, Mumbo :)
P.S. Cool Armadillo. I love the eyebrows.
you should use the new 1.20.3 /tick rate & /tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video, would probably help alot
What you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn. Programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together. When you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique. A person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning, and cool looking, final product
The fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
Reminds me of clockwork. Certainly gears are simple at their core, but when combining them in large geartrains, the complexity increases. A lot of it is down to timing (speed) and torque. 

Fascinating.
From now on, every time Mumbo states that something is simple, we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement.
I've only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle, and I've already learned so much about these flying machines. Thank you so much, Mumbo!
Great video as always! Not sure if you've had a look at all the new snapshot features yet (besides the crafting bench), but the variable tick speed is really useful for showing/seeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly.
The carpet mod (or even in vanilla since 1.20.3) adds the /tick command
This is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game, and then go one tick at a time and see exactly what's happening and when.
Incredibly informative. Grian and Scar can now fix Doc's giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 😄
I think this makes the whole process so much cooler, even if in total it's fairly simple
Really cool to see the inner workings of how these seemingly complicated machines actually work!",20,Gaming,9260000,PT17M52S

Omg Ms Tate should get into making ASMR as a side gig she would KILL it
okay but the jacket sounds are SOO relaxing?? she killed this 💫
i really appreciate that she took asmr seriously. it’s so annoying and rude when other celebrities don’t
You know the ASMR is elite when you’re not even wearing headphones and you get tingles ❤
AS SOMEONE WHO LOVES ASMR AND TATE THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVERRRR
I remember watching videos of her original songs when I was 9 or 10 and now I’m about to be 17. She’s made it so far and she deserves everything she has and more. She’s great at ASMR too
I haven’t listened to her in years but she’s grown so much! were almost 2 years apart, but I still feel like a proud mother💀 gonna stream her albums!
She's so good at it, and the candle lighting portion with the words of reassurance. The smirk and eye roll saying ""Relax"", I am now convinced shes watched some ASMR before.
This is such a good asmr video, she seems so natural at it. Got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough 😅
She needs to make her own asmr broo the crispiness of her whispers and binaural technique is so good
I am BEGGING for whoever edits these videos to make the part where they do ASMR with the W Magazine longer. it is so satisfying and one of my fav parts but always gets cut short
WOW this is cool she not only has a great singing voice she has a incredible whispering voice so soothing and soft fabulous T-McRae she impresses in every way..all the time so talented love it...

Jacob is a PHENOMENAL actor
Lou, Vic, and Jake, on one episode of game changer. That's 100% going to be a banger
I love getting all worked up for a new Dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
The way my heart caught in my throat when Jacob started yelling at Sam.
Love that BDG is doing a lot of stuff with Dropout nowadays.
I can’t tell you how excited I am to see Nathan on Dropout again. Please please please more collabs with the Drawfee hosts. Their gremlin energy is just what I need ❤
Seeing Nathan actually makes me a little emotional. Drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropout/CH, but I'm glad to see some Drawfee/dropout mixing is still possible.
I saw Jacob storm out and then the TV says “do something great for the trailer” I mean…. I had to pause the trailer because I started dying of laughter
Well Jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 😂
The fact that I was not scared at all Jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of Dropout
More Vic, more Brennan meltdowns, and more Grant skin? YES, PLEASE. Also, I love how ""upset a producer"" was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set, but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks 😂Give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos! 😁
BDG, Sungwon, AND NATHAN?! The already incredible cast is only getter better 🥺
I'm so excited
I'm stoked as always. And I just wanted to say that the ""that should cut good"" shows such respect for your audience, and we hardly ever see that in reality TV. Nicely done, y'all.
BDG and Sungwon graduating from Make Some Noise to Game Changer proper plus Caldwell and Nathan making their Game Changer debuts?!?! Oh yeah. This is gonna be a good season.
Love how the marketing/throughline of this series keeps getting slightly more ""horror/thriller"" with each season.
Jesus, Jacob’s acting legitimately got me there for a second
I'm so relieved Jacob wasn't actually upset! I teared up a bit lol
I’m so excited for Nathan Drawfee!! Hopefully this will lead to more Drawfee/Dropout crossovers in the future, I need some more snilk and Drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
I’m so excited to see Nathan. As a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan I’m happy to see you folks doing stuff together. Even after Drawfee went independent I hoped there’d be some crossovers still. And I’m not disappointed. (I see why you didn’t have Karina, she’s too powerful. Although she’d rock in a yu-gi-oh episode of um actually.)

I hate that the DA office won't charge these guys even with all the evidence.
This is a masterpiece!
I see a lot of people asking Mark not to stop this and I'm gonna be one of them as well. Mark you've stopped so many issues that nobody else would within just a short amount of time. You've done more than most higher authority within just a few years and I'm sure everyone here can thank you for that. Please continue this series because everyone truly needs this as much as you do.
What is really sad is how freaking nonchalant they are about breaking into so many cars and they have routes.
I absolutely love how thorough and all out this guy goes.  He seems like he could have been a HANDFUL as a teenager
I like how mark is focused on expressing how the spray is harmless even though I don't think anyone would complain even if he put some mustard gas or CS in there
You have to keep doing this series. The instant karma is awesome. And you're helping to deter people (hopefully) from taking stuff that isn't theirs
Mark is a master storyteller. The series must go on!
Mark please continue to make these holiday videos! It spreads awareness and clearly law enforcement isn’t doing much. I started watching them with my son when he was 4 and now he’s 9 and still loves them.
This series CAN NOT STOP. Thieves never learn.
This guy does more work than the authorities will ever do.
Such an amazing job with all the stuff that went into this. Shame to hear it's the last saga of the glitter bomb stuff but I'll stay hopeful that we'll get an ""Oops, looks like we're back at it again"" comeback or something lol

quick update- had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the House Building song from RDR2. All I basically say is that “the bounty system in starfield is even worse than RDR2 and being a pirate is so discouraged it’s borderline impossible” anyways thanks so much for watching this video 🥹 I was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it! ❤❤ big ups to the whole island

An amazing and high quality video as always Jakey! I seriously appreciate you mentioning how good Skyrim's OST is since that's like the king of music for me. FYI the audio cuts out at 29:48 - 30:05 and 30:15 - 30:23
Really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing, the flow, the script, the scene choices, the cutaway timing, all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same. New, but nostalgic. This is a huge development in the NakeyJakey career path, maybe getting a bit wiser...  can't wait to see a new video in like 3 years!
16:55 as a parent of a toddler seeing this Ms. Rachel spoof sent me. It was really well done. And to be clear, we absolutely adore Ms. Rachel in my house.
For a year before Starfield’s launch, my manager couldn’t stop talking about it. He would go on and on about how it was everything he’s ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched.

Last week, he came poked his head out from the other room and asked, “What was the name of that space game we used to play?” Dude couldn’t even remember the name of it anymore. Now granted, my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid (his favorite movie of all time is Battlefield Earth…. I know), but I still feel like this means something.
That clip of Todd Howard saying how he told everyone he’d make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
Dear Jacob,

Another fantastic video as always. I really liked the style of cinematography in this one. It was obviously different than your usual style, but that's not a bad thing by any means. It felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend. 

I've been following your content since 2017 - went all the way through high school and am starting college now, always looking forward to the next Jarby video. Thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us, and enjoy the holidays!
An entire town wanting you dead in Skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly, but the idea that Starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what you've done is the funniest thing I've heard all week.
I think the signs were there a long time ago...I played ES4 Oblivion extensively...wasn't perfect but I still had a lot of fun with it...when Skyrim came out I was hyped, but I never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after I got it, it was exceptionally underwhelming. I still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line (EG, I always preferred Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storyline over fighting dragons,) then something has gone terribly wrong.
Something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every ""unexplored frontier"" planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it. I'm not exploring and finding something new, I'm just playing tourist. It would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot #35
Thank you for finally putting into words why I just could not get into Starfield! I am a huge Bethesda fan - I have been playing Skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes, along with the Fallout games. I wanted to love Starfield so much, but after a few hours I just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there. I also think you're one of the few people who shares my opinion on Fallout 3's atmosphere vs. New Vegas, so I appreciate the nod to that as well.
Starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isn't fun and there's like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn.
33:33 Funny thing about the item vacuum in jail. The items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room, and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower. Early game it’s actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared, lock pick your stuff back, then be on your way.

There is one thing all these youtubers should know:

""The only safe house in Minecraft is a hidden one!""
-Mumbo Jumbo
Oh boy… this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these… 🤔
Yeah these ‘safest bases’ are usually pathetically easy to enter. Their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create ‘easy defenses’ that are redundant and pointless, serving to introduce more vulnerability
I thought this base was really secure but then I had a very good idea, I used F5, see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and I was able to see that this base was insecure
I knew he would debunk it eventually, while watching I was like, bro kenadian is going to DESTROY This lol
Lesson learned: next time you want to build a base, watch out for kenadians in the wild.
Yer... The base is kinda dumb. It only works if you obey very specific rules, and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare.

All these safest bases just don't work without other mods, commands, datapacks etc to add additional mechanics.

Still thanks for showing just how easy it is.
When Kenadian is bored, he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things:
1. I'm glad Carvs was a good sport about this, it's always nice to see someone who can take a joke.
2. I was thinking the exact same things when I was watching his video. I was like, ""Couldn't someone just fly or build through this whole thing? This design seems super exploitable.""
Someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools: damn this is a safe base
Kenadian beating it without taking damage: *hold my beer*
2:31 3:22 I love the little detail of while he's explaining why this base is actually secure, he's just chilling in the middle of the ""danger"" zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
This safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremode.(New to minecraft)
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
I looked at this base and thought it was very secure. But then I had a very good idea - I used blocks. See, using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armor/potions. Simple.
The fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
Guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point, mad respect
Is easier to destroy than to create. No base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated. Still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base.
i was already impressed. but the half a heart challenge was the cherry on top for me. Well done

The sheer amount of work that went into doing that last animation makes me once again feel amazed at the commitment of the team to produce high-quality work week after week. I love this.
As a railway worker in the US, thank you for this absolutely well done story and bringing more attention to how far our industry is falling.
Thank you, John, for bringing this horrible deregulation to light. We are a Corporatocracy and it’s got to stop.
Freight conductor here, thank you for highlighting corporate greed's utter destruction of this once great job/industry. The railroads do everything they can to keep things in house and out of the public eye. Please people, with all the support for striking unions remember to support rail workers should we decide to walk out.
I am a railroad worker and this episode is spot on. Great episode. Thanks for getting the word out.
Matt Berry provided some absolutely killer narration for the beautiful end animation, well done Lazlo Cravensworth
My dad was a conductor for decades. He nearly had a his body ripped apart from a derailment. Thank you for your coverage on this.
As a former railroad worker thank you so much for shedding light on this topic. Genuinely.
I worked for the Forest Service for a summer and regularly had to drive over railroad tracks that had no lights or stop signs or gates. The rule for those of us who had to cross them was to stop and make sure it was clear before crossing. A Big Wig had called about the lack of safety measures at that spot , and was told that no improvements would be made until a certain number of accidents (cars vs. trains) happened.  😳😳
I was hoping you'd also talk about how freight trains have made it impossible to have reliable passenger rail service in the US, because they own all the track.
That Henry skit at the end was a beautiful piece of art, and I am so damn glad they got Matt Berry for it.
Also, $1M for anyone that manages to put that into children's programming!
Spot on.  Seriously spot on.  My husband worked for BNSF for 41 years, and is still so terrified they will remove his retirement, he would flip out if he knew I made a comment.  I have been saying the 'safety' thing was bullshit for decades, but I had no idea it had become policy.  What a crock.  What wasn't mentioned in your piece though, is that one of the other ways they really save money is to ignore the track itself, and miles and miles of it is in such a state of disrepair it is becoming increasingly worrisome.  Couple that with the extreme weather conditions, and we will see lots more derailments happening.  Also, at one point, there was a rule that the train could not block a highway for too long, so they would have to split the train apart and open up the crossing while they wait.  This only happened if it was a state highway or major thoroughfare though, so trains in small towns, that have an overpass now, will sit for hours.  Thanks for tackling this issue.
This show should get an award for that animation sequence at the end! The story telling was 🤌
The crew on this show deserves their flowers.  The bit at the end was brilliant,  much like the others that are done on here.  I really appreciate watching this show.
John and his team *NEVER* disappoint. Thank you.
Loved ""Henry"" at the end, too!
The end bit on this was phenomenal, hats off to the builders for really putting in the effort. It shows.
I lived in a small town in Florida. (Crescent City) The local poor people thought that the nice gravel under the tracks would make nice driveways, so they took buckets of it each night, until the rails were undermined to the point where a train derailed. Fortunately, there was no dangerous cargo, just cars full of people. No one died, but there were many injuries. 

How many thousands of miles of track are being undermined by locals wanting gravel for their driveways?
My brother in law works for the railroad, and knowing his work situation, I would never wish that on anyone. He doesn't get to choose when he takes vacation, he gets about a day notice of when his vacation is, he works sixty hour weeks all the time, and if you're in the railroad system, you pay into railroad retirement instead of social security, so you're trapped in the system if you want to have anything to retire on.",24,Entertainment,9290000,PT27M40S

#richeisenshow #nfl #kansascitychiefs",4098,"Maybe the officiating has been awful this year, but this isn't an example of bad officiating.  The referee did his job correctly.
Throwing the penalty flag without knowing what happens next is the most fair thing the ref can do in that situation. And Mahomes berating a ref because his team is struggling instead of holding his teammate accountable for the lack of discipline is crazy.
The fact that he was CLEARLY offsides but yet the media wants to have the convo ""should it have been called?""  Especially Rich being an NFL Network employee , is mind boggling to me.  Because what this does is opens Pandora's box of the league being rigged and choosing who they want to win by calling or not calling penalties.
The game didn't end with a bad call, It ended with three incomplete passes.
Kadarius actually looked at where the ball was and still lined up offsides. He deserves it.
I don’t remember Patrick Mahomes complaining about all the defensive penalties called against KC opponents late in games during the playoffs past couple years 😢 DIVA
The Chiefs benefit from so many calls it’s nice to finally see  it balancing out a bit.
Mahomes had absolutely no problem with the bad “unnecessary roughness” late hit on the sideline last week
Whether the penalty impacted the play is irrelevant. A couple weeks ago the Broncos missed field goal got called back because of 12 men on the field. No shot that extra man impacted the field goal but you didnt see Allen and McDermott crying to the refs about making that call in such a ""critical moment."" It's an objective call, the chiefs need to take some accountability.
Rich, just like the other Mahomes lovers, Colin, Nick and the whole cast Good Morning Football are like, “it’s Mahomes, don’t throw penalties against them inside the 2 min warning “ 😂
Offsides is like the most objective penalty in football. You can go on about controversial pass interference calls, because that's a bit more subjective of a call. But offsides is about as clear as you can get.
All that frustration from Mahomes and Reid needs to directed at Tony, not the officials.  It was a helluva play, but the guy that scored also committed an obvious foul.
The most damning thing is that the penalty didn’t end the game. Mahomes had multiple downs left to do something, and he didn’t. That’s what ended the game.
I think Rich misunderstood the ref's answer to the pool reporter. He said if the WR asked for advice he'd give it (insinuating Toney didn't check first). If he was barely offside they may choose to just warn them after the play, but it was so egregious and there was no check, so there was no way they could look the other way.
Didn't the Chiefs win a couple of games earlier this year due to last minute officiating calls that were phantom calls? I'm pretty sure one was with the Jets.
To make sure that there aren't any misunderstandings, the officials should stop letting the receivers know if they are lined up offsides or not.
Last week Chiefs got a bad call on PI.  They also benefitted from a bogus calls,  roughing on QB, no 10 second runoff on the reversal and another clock stoppage when receiver was going backwards and did NOT go out of bounds!
Rich brings back all the good ESPN memories.    Way to stay the same as you used to be.
We had a kid, a friend of mine, in High School during a scrimmage game, forget to put his mouth piece in before the snap.  The ball is snapped, a great play gaining many yards takes place, all to be called back because my friend inadvertently didn't put in his mouth piece.  Have you ever seen a play in the pro game called back because of ""an equipment malfunction""?  Game winning touchdown called back because Tom Brady threw a touchdown pass with his shirt tail hanging out.  I haven't.  But until the Chiefs game I had never seen an Offside on the offense.  Then I saw it again Sunday night when the Cowboys did it against the Eagles.  It was mentioned that like a few hours before that this penalty has all the commonality of two men wearing the same jersey number at the same time on the field, as was the case in a Boise State game a couple years ago.  But it's a written rule.  Jay Walking is a written traffic offense that not many, if any policeman has ever enforced.  But it's a written rule.  It's in the script.  It isn't the referees job to police the formations.  One article I read asked the question, ""was a warning in order"".  A warning?  Hey Kadarius, you're offside, get you butt back over on your side!  Ok.  Hey Bob, hey Pete, you two are moving at the same time, you can't do that.  Hey Bill, quit wiggling, I'll have to call you for a false start.  It's the players job to police themselves on the field, and their coaches jobs to make sure they are lined up where they should be.  Not the ref, side judge, back judge, or judge judy.  When you look at the still photo, Kadarius is practically shaking hands with the defensive player in front of him.  The flag was thrown the moment the ball was snapped, not after the touchdown ceremony had been completed.  Patrick and Andy had every right to be upset.  The same way a person caught red handed breaking into a house has the right to complain while he's being cuffed.
Thanks for bringing up the Super Bowl.  No one else has brought that up.  Mahomes gets a taste of what it's like to be on the other end.",17,Sports,666000,PT15M59S

#VGG #cadillac",9285,"I worked for Cadillac as a district service manager when that car was introduced. In pre-release service meetings, it was well-known from the very beginning, that the 8/6/4 was planned to be a one-year-only engine. The big problem was the early Delco electronics. The MAP sensor was calibrated with too-close tolerances. If the engine hic-upped (backfired) it would shut down. There was no repair except to replace the MAP sensor. The bigger problem was replacement stock was the exact same part, and it took GM a while before an updated unit could be supplied. Dealers would disconnect the 8/6/4 feature, running it as an 8cyl only. The press had a field day. I inspected a limo in West Palm Beach, Florida, that the owner wanted all the interior chrome replaced. Someone had discharged a tear gas device inside the car that caused the damage ( the interior chrome pieces came from different suppliers, so it was impossible for all of it to be defective) and I denied the claim. It turned out the limo was owned by the owner of the newspaper 'The National Inquirer"" (famous for stories like 'I got pregnant by an alien, etc.) They went on a HUGE hate campaign, smearing the vehicle, which only threw fuel on the fire. Those were tough times to be a Cadillac District Service manager.
As a 35 year mechanic I want to say that I admire Derek for messing with that aggravating thing. RESPECT!
""The brake drum has traveled farther than the vehicle itself"" man that was classic.
God I love me an old school Caddy!
The Cadillac of despair. What a test of wits and perseverance. I felt for you through all of it while still bursting into laughter a number of times. What an extraordinary episode, thanks Derek for actually putting this one out :)
Oh man, that brake drum divorcing itself from the vehicle was epic. It totally went with the whole project. My experience with TBI dumping fuel was the coolant temp sensor 2 wire funny enough. The computer relied on coolant temp for fuel mapping. Could be bad injectors maybe. Great video, laughed a lot
This revival will be a top favorite now just for the amount of genuine laughs as things kept progressively happening. The brake drum and the flame out of the  TBI.  You’re the best man thank you for what you do!
What a fight!! I think this is a great candidate for a junkyard LS. Or a good old 350.
Way to keep on fighting through! I would’ve thrown in the towel way earlier!
I don’t think GM TBI fuel injection from the 80’s worked like a modern ECU. It was a while ago, but I think they start in open loop mode with a fixed map on temperature, manifold pressure, and throttle position. Once it warms up, it switches to closed loop mode where it mostly uses the O2 sensor. I bet when it was running good it was because it was in closed loop mode. Getting it to run long enough to switch to closed loop looked difficult though.
I’d love to see round 2. There are several struggles you had that I’ve learned from.
Appreciate the perseverance! I would really like to see this thing run and drive, even if it means a carb swap or something else along those lines. I just don’t think this should be how it ends with this rig.
Man you really worked for every bit of that one.

Thanks for everything you do!!
Awesome as usual! Very interesting how the critters migrated the under hood insulation to the exhaust system!
Even though she didn't drive home, this was still a fantastic episode. The patience, perseverance and diagnostic progression you show is truly impressive. Shout out to O'Reilly for the support. Absolutely loved the brake drum's desire to get back on the road!
We LOVED this episode. My wife cracked up when the brake drum shot across the shop. You can't let this thing beat you. Toss a modern EFI system on it and make it a super nice, ""Take momma out to dinner"" rig.
I definitely want to see a carburetor swap and a general engine bay cleanup where you get rid of as many hoses and wires as possible
This has to be one of my favorite episodes.......The runaway brake drum fleeing the scene and then the fire in the hole.........absolutely hilarious.  I laughed so hard my dogs starting barking at me......🤣🤣🤣🤣
HELL of an effort!! I don't think I've seen you slither the floor that much EVER. The launch of the drum was CLASSIC. My brother-in-law and some other students at an Agriculture engineering school in MO began the design on this engine in the 70's for an AG engine, NOT a passenger car. The story goes that the college sold the idea to GM and they took it and proceeded to wreck it. 
Great effort!!!
I'm only about half way through the video so far, but man, does it make me feel good watching you go through many of the struggles I go through on my Cadillac.  It makes me feel so much more normal lol
Derek what a great episode I was really hoping you would get this thing going, but props to you for showing that everything does not always go as planned and showing that sometimes even when we do our best we still fail, but it is best to learn from this experience! So what would I like to see done with his vehicle? Well, I would like to see it moving down to the road the 368 Cadillac is a great engine and very durable and reliable As long as it doesn’t have this particular fuel delivery system. Also, it is the last of the Cadillac V8 so first thing and you’ve already done this disconnect the cylinder deactivation as most Cadillac dealers did and let it run as a V-8 Secondly remove all of the fuel injection paraphernalia from 1981 and replace it with some type of Holley fuel injection system and then make sure it’s ship shape and maybe give it away I mean I would would like to own of these if it had a reliable fuel delivery system just my two cents. Thanks again for another great video.",2,Autos & Vehicles,1760000,PT2H20M59S

the fortune tellers saying jaiden would have 3 kids is suddenly making a lot more sense.
GOOD JOB ARI AND TOFU WOOOO LETS GOOOO
Check out the Scribble After Dark tour!! Grab tickets here :) http://scribbleshowdown.com/
I can’t believe we witnessed jaiden growing up so fast, first a college student now a grandmother
If you want to keep the eggs and want to move them out of the freezer you can also encase them in resin as a memento of her laying eggs without running the risk of accidentally breaking them in the freezer or having them explode. Cause normal eggs can explode in the freezer and idk if it would be harder or easier to explode tiny eggs like that.
If you go back and watch Ari's first birthday there's a great segment that goes along the lines of "" I don't know Ari's gender the only way to really know is a DNA test unless it's too late and you already have eggs everywhere""
For anyone wondering, there are two types of birds: nesting and non-nesting. A nesting bird's babies are called ""nestlings"" and (when first hatched) are SUPER fragile, needs constant food, cannot walk or fly, is completely featherless and takes longer to mature. A non-nesting bird's babies are just called ""chicks"" and (when first hatched) can walk, don't need constant food, cannot fly and has a ""fuzzy"" coat that keeps them warm independantly of their mother.

Chickens, turkeys, quail, pheasants, ducks, geese etc. all give birth to ""chicks"", which is why you may be thinking that baby birds are easy to care for. They kinda just figure out life on their own. Nestling birds need special equipment, foods and sometimes medicines to be raised by humans. You need to feed them every 4-6 hours with a syringe, keep them warm and keep them hydrated (which is harder to do when they are kept warm). For the duration of their infancy, you basically have to nap instead of sleep, or have a second person assist you as you both plan your sleep schedules to do a 12/12 shift. You need to take care of them for something or rather EVERY 3 HOURS, ON THE HOUR. Raising a bird seems really cool, but don't raise a nestling unless you know EVERYTHING about the species you are trying to raise.
Tip: if you want to know if the eggs are fertilized or not just put a flashlight over them and look if there is any red spots over the yellow gold.
Jaiden: ""I hope they get along""
The birds: ""bubble gum electric""
As a female cockatiel owner egg binding is a scary concept. I’ve been told calcium supplements and a vet visit to remove any stuck eggs is fine but still. So, Sol’s cage has no possible nesting spots and when she’s out of it she’s always with me so it’s all good 👍🏼 

Sol is such a personable sweetheart, I adore her. She demands head scritches from everyone (including the VET lol) and hates hates hates raisins. Like will literally throw them out of her feed hates them. Learned that the first time when I was hand feeding her bits of her feed and she bounced it off my knee XD

As for the sawdust comment, I can 100% believe that. Sol had a toy meant for the parakeets my twin and I used to have before they passed but never ended up giving it to, and she adored it. She cronched that thing like cookie wafer - sounded like it too. Anyway, the moment it stopped being an out of cage toy and I hung it up inside said cage it got absolutely demolished very quickly, and there was just woodchips. Everywhere. SO many woodchips. I swear the thing should not have produced that many but it did

I adore birds, they’re my favorite kind of pet. But I am very consciously aware that a cockatiel is my best match and not, say, a conure or heaven forbid, an actual parrot. And that’s okay. Also Jaiden is 110% correct raising baby birds is a NIGHTMARE. I would’ve done the same thing, as would many other bird owners. Google it if you don’t believe us. Back on topic though, while in my opinion birds make for the best kind of pet you need to take into account whether or not you are able to give them the time and attention they need. Know what you can and cannot do, and if you can’t that’s okay. Know your limits. But don’t get a bird if you can’t take care of it properly, it’ll just end in tears 

So, to sum it up: egg binding is scary, Sol is the best (sorry not sorry Ari and Tofu), bird sawdust is real, raising baby birds is a nightmare, and birds make for the best pets if and ONLY if you’re able to meet their needs, and there’s nothing wrong with you if you can’t. Just don’t get a bird if so
Pray for Jaden that she doesn’t lose her mind from taking care of lots of birds
As an ER vet who sees birds, I agree with 100% of your sentiments about bird ownership at the end. Loved the video, very humorous but also spreading the truth about bird ownership.
My friend had three parakeets in the past.. the mother died naturally and then the daughter unalived her father.. glad to see Tofu and Ari are well 😅
I love Jaiden’s pet videos about her feathered babies. Hopefully she makes one for Tostada the kitty cat one day too
0:15 i just wanna mention how nice this depiction of this fanbase is. All just calmly cheering for Ari. i love this depiction because fans of any media these days sometimes are portrayed as rabidly obsessed creatures with no sense of reason. and it hurts when you're part of that fanbase. it really shows the maturity of her team and of Jaidens fans. i commend you all. this really is such a lovely, mature and respectful community.
as a long time fan, this is crazy to watch. never would i have thought ari would become a dad. or a mom.
As a cat owner of the most gremlin, crazy cats, I laughed so hard at this video. Pet owners of the pets who destroy things but who you love dearly truly understand where you’re coming from 😂
As a green cheek conure owner: Piccolo and Bansuri are some of the best things that ever happened to me, I regret nothing, and simultaneously they’re the bane of my existence.

#RedFalcon #Gaming #Mario",474,"Wubba's fate is still tragic, but congrats to the winner!! What a well-deserved victory
That was a masterpiece, a total roller-coaster of emotions. Even the man with no tear ducts that can't cry shed tears for our fallen warriors. We love you Hoppy. And R.I.P Metal Mario the original under dog
this one is special to us. i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible ❤
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
Genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops. That was a wild vid
Even though hoppy cat won, congrats to medal Mario for being the underdog
This video is the true definition of tragic. I rooted for metal mario the whole way through, but he came just short. But congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory.
Why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream, can’t wait for the faster Mario kart to become a vid :)
But… how far can the hoppycat go?
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did, he DESERVED first, he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory, meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection. Even if metal mario only got second, he had to work for it. im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it weren't for that level, and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
Mods are already so crazy.... I'm so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds!!
The fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasn’t possible is impressive itself
This is crazy! I haven’t seen the end yet, but this is gonna be interesting, every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay, so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting.
As a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win!
You should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go, and I already know he’ll be going to world 4 at least, since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels. I was rooting for them and am so happy they won.
I'd love to see Hoppycat beat the game! Always love the little enemies.
Great video, so many twists and turns! As a long time red falcon fan I must say I'm loving these new videos and editing style!
wonder how far the wubba would've made it if water levels weren't required, i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game
Fantastic video! Love the concept, execution, and editing!

Swimming tall guy is my favorite.

As a Madrid fan, I’m not surprised at all. They have played and given all their might to that red and white shirt, and it would be a literal honor to the league if they pull a Leicester City type of thing at the end of the season. Remarkable from Girona 👏
Girona and their coach Michael Sanchez wasn't just there to beat Barcelona, it's as if he was also making an audition to be Barcelona's coach in the future.

He outcoached Xavi and all his substitutes made impacts to put the game away. 

Girona have scored the most goals in La Liga while being top of the league.
Girona ability to hold and retain possession was well executed. Rarely are teams able to keep possession against Barcelona, but they were playing and passing through the Barca press almost with ease. I saw they also changed their system a bit from their usual one, so they clearly trained and practiced for this occasion all week and it paid dividends.
WOW, Girona is for real. What a statement. They seem to have a well balanced team. I hope for them continued success!!
As a Real Madrid fan, I would not be mad if girona won the league
Barca defense is all over the place...shocking performance!!!!
I think a new style of football is on the rise to counter the high press, possession hungry teams. Teams like Barcelona overcommit their midfielders and fullbacks. Managers used to set up low block and counter. Basically allowing Barcelona to toss the ball around in the middle third. I've seen some progressions that started with taking away pivots then passing lanes to the pivots. That kept teams like Barcelona at their own side of the middle third more than close to the final third. I feel like teams are now exposing the middle third by dropping back enough, win the ball then quickly move the ball in the open spaces in the middle third then on to the final third. They constantly put pressure the CBs since teams like Barcelona will have every midfielders pushed up the field. Teams like Girona are taking advantage of the empty middle third and stressing tf out of the CB by using their high backline against them.
It’s time we fans, and the board, start questioning Xavi. This isn’t the first time he fails with this team when it really matters.
Girona are really impressive. Michael Sanchez made very good subs and their style of play is impressive. I really hope they can last the full season for an exciting title race!
Well done to Girona. As a Barca fan, I knew this wasn't easy. Their attacking efficiency is absolutely amazing, and I think they scored in every single game since October. I have complete faith We will improve and come back much stronger. In the meantime, welcome to the top of the table.
Hopefully girona actually tend to play like this for a while. La liga could really use exciting teams like them
Pure unbelievable performance by Girona.
Girona not only beat Barca, they looked so comfortable doing it.
Barca fan (it’s been tough lately but I’m loyal) and I gotta say I hope Girona take the championship this season not only is it good for the league but they deserve to win it for the game they’re playing and heart they’re showing. Let’s just focus on the championship league for now.
This is the greatest moment in La Liga in the last 10 years. Many young football viewers have no idea the consequence of this and how important this is for Spanish football
Even if Girona had only won 1-0 the way they dominated Barcelona was impressive!
Girona showing proper teamwork, hardwork and running your socks off is what it takes brilliant display and deserve to be top of the league. Reminds me of leicester city when they won a few years back.
The way Girona is passing the ball around Barcelona, especially inside the box is class.
I said this when the season began, Xavi needs to go. Also, credit where credit is due, Girona looking mighty impressive. City group has done wonders for that club, lets see if this performance is there to stay or if its just a wonder season kinda run.",17,Sports,3450000,PT14M26S

Surprised by the 20 point win. And Aubrey making 4 45+ yard field goals?! Giving Dan Bailey a run for his money as my favorite Cowboys kicker
That long Dallas field goal had the power+accuracy to travel  70+ yards. Wow
Aubrey is amazing. Solved the Cowboys kicking game completely.
Love how Aubrey comes off the soccer pitch onto the football field and just can’t seem to miss. Even his 59, 60 yard field goals look like a walk in the park to him
As an Eagles fan, ggs to Dallas. They played extremely well and deserved the win. I think the Eagles need to change their strategy a bit, but, yeah. Eagles-Cowboys games are always fun to watch, regardless the results.
On top of everything else, I’m really happy with the running game I saw too. Pollard and Dowdle deserve a lot of credit
My first Cowboy game ever was a win. I’ll never forget this game. Everyone in the stands including myself yelling HERE WE GO was awesome
Stephon Gilmore is HIM!! What an absolute gem of a game from him.
One of the most complete cowboys teams ever
Between this game and the 49ers... It's safe to say that the eagles head coach has been considerably humbled. The cowboys are looking like a real SB contender this year. We'll see.
It's a good time to be a cowboys fan I think they've really improved this season especially their WR's and defense carrying the game.
Went to this game, energy was INSANE, stadium was unreal and came out with a dub 🔥
That tackle by Gilmore at 10:00 mark was beautiful to watch.  Also Aubrey is a freak of nature.
Love seeing these power plays by TE’s, even when they’re not going for a big gain, still seeing some of the best blocks off the edge for Ferguson I’ve ever seen in NFL history, dude is a young Jason Witten.
Man I cried watching this game, my son went to the Christmas Eve game last year . It was his very first NFL game and unfortunately his last. He passed away Christmas morning and I’ve been devastated ever since. I am grateful that his last day on this planet was filled with excitement and joy. Thank you to Dak and the Cowboys for giving him that. I will root for them for my son Michael. #forever18
My favorite part is when Tirico said, with the game changing play!!😂😂😂 Didn't change a thing!!! Gooooo COWBOYS!
This was more than a win for Dallas. This was to show the fans we still got it!!👌🏼💪
This game is exactly what I was hoping to see. The Cowboys pound the Eagles into the turf with overwhelming and devastating force.
RIP to that first down marker. A true unsung hero of the game. You shall never be forgotten ✊🏽 4:12",17,Sports,12300000,PT12M39S

Thank you so much lazar, you had such a influence on my life. Thank you and please keep uploading
Best vid ever this and the part at the end you and your dad just kicking back, you can tell he is proud of you, you've come a bloody long way mate
Lannan both loving and abusing a rock is the most wholesome moment I ever seen
The fact that Bodie is about to be 11 makes me feel like an old man
A decade ago, we all witnesses a bloody legend enter a community that will continue to love him for the way he is. Happy early birthday Lazar, you've never failed to impress us. You are the *GOAT.*
Lazar has been gone for what seems to be ages and he comes back bigger and better! love the content.
I feel like having Lazar as an Uncle would never get boring.
It’s great to see your dad back ❤

I’d always remember his face of joy when he hit you during your no swearing challenge like 4 years ago XDD
It's awesome to think that when he started making vids he was considered a deadbeat kid with no future, and know to think that he is by far the most successful person in his families history and is acknowledged and loved by 21 million people. KEEP GOING LAZAR
Hey lazar, thanks for bring me and my dad so much joy and fun while watching your videos. I used to sneak watch your videos in 2018 because I wasn’t allowed to watch stuff with cursing lol, and in 2020 when Covid started I got my dad into playing Fortnite. And he found you and I had to act like I’ve never seen you before and I rewash all of your videos with me and my dad just laughing side-by-side so thank you for all the happiness and laughter youve given me and my dad! Im definitely buying a cookd shirt for me and my dad for Christmas!!
Man, I know Lannan has struggled with some stuff recently, but he's such a good guy. He deserves everything good in his life. Such a wholesome dude.
We are so proud of you from the start to now we all saw you grow and meme around. We all admire you Thank you for the hard work you put in!
It actually brings a tear to my eye see how much you have progressed in life and in your channel I have watched every video from day one and will continue to forever. Thank you Lannan for being the best inspiration I could look up to.
Really have enjoyed watching you grow the main channel so much and bringing this one back, been with ya since early 2016 in the days of random games like Guts ‘n Glory
I absolutely love this video! A perfect throwback to the beginning of it all, and just seeing dumb shit happen. Lannan you bloody legend!
We’ve come such a long way. Thank you so much for all the videos and memories that you have created. You are honestly the best YouTuber ever

Props to the Pacers for being in striking distance late despite a terrible shooting night. They played hard.
Lakers winning with only 2 made 3 pointers🤯 they really went back to 80s bully ball for this one! Congrats LA💜💛
The Lakers successfully didn't let Haliburton get going. Kudos to their defensive gameplan.
I was one of the ones hating on the tournament at first but it was honestly very enjoyable, I could care less if people think it matters or not, the players put in a lot of effort in and at the end of the day I just like watching good basketball
Congrats to the Lakers for their success and Thank you to the NBA for giving us some exciting competitive games early in the season.
What an incredible all round performance by the Lakers. Reddish, Vando, and Prince set the tone by their great perimeter defense and taking Harliburton out of his game. AD was an absolute beast ...41 points and 20 reb. LeBron driving like a free train to the paint. Congratulations to the Lakers 🎉❤️❤💯💯
So excited for the momentum that the Lakers will have coming off this W... the Lakers just need to figure out how to keep AD motivated, because he clearly has this in him on any given night... the inconsistency is the problem
This is high energy, fast paced basketball! The players are into it, getting hyped. Very exciting to watch. Great first in season tournament, glad it’s a thing
Congratulations to the Lakers for winning the first ever In Season Tournament Lebron Showed us that he is the face of the lead AD show out like the way most fans wanted him too,Pacers deserved some applaud they have a bright future ahead of them.
This is a huge chemistry boost for the Lakers, and the perfect simulation of a playoff atmosphere for a lot of the young guys. The IST has been a huge success!

Also shout out to Cam Reddish. Dude has proven that he’s worth more that his contract with defense alone, and has potential to be a great 3 and D wing. Love to see it
Nothing but respect for the pacers......that was a great and hard fought game.
What a game they both payed hard and left it all on the court this is what the in season tournament is about. We don’t get this same level of energy and aggression from regular season games.
To the Lakers and the Pacers, big, big props to them for making it this far in the inaugural edition of the In Season Tournament NBA Cup! 

Hope they continue their good showing for many more months to come!
Having the Lakers win the first in season tournament is sooo good for the nba
Congratulations to LeBron James  and Los Angeles Lakers ! Thank you NBA  for a successful tournament! That was so amazing and entertaining. 🎈🎉🎊🎖️🏆😉😁
Wow, monster performance by the Lakers! Man LEking attacking like his prime; combined with AD the Lakers deserves. Congrats on both team! What a game.
This was actually fun to watch, I hope the NBA continues this. And congrats to the Lakers even though obviously the chip at the end is the goal for everyone, it's still great to be on this side of history as the *first* ever winner of this Tourny.
That 86 points in the paint is really really CRAZY!!! . History is made  Congrats Lakers .
This In-season tournament is s stroke of genius from commish. It hypes something tangible to look forward to in the lull of the winter season, and also provides the teams to up their competition as a dress rehearsal for the playoffs. I haven't seen intensity by AD like this for a long time. Its obvious the players enjoyed this level of competition for something.",17,Sports,21200000,PT10M1S

She’s so chill, he couldn’t make her get out of character lmao. Team Jaidyn 💕
Idk how you can’t like this girl, she just so chill and goes with the flow. 🦋🦋
I’m glad she’s doing these interviews. She’s very likable once she interviews solo. She has a nice personality.
The way Marco just be cutting them off like ""vibe check"" is hilarious 😂😂😂
She was not intimidated at all… 😂 she played her cards right with Marco. He couldn’t get her out of character and she matched his energy & sarcasm. She’s so cool and chill. She seems like she would be a good friend. With being with a narcissist Ike Blue face for so long, no one can manipulate her lol
When he looks at the camera with the blank stare i can't stop laughing 😂😂😂
Everyone needs to realise she has been a stay at home regular mother like all the other woman. She is very realistic and doesn’t let her emotions control her opportunities its nice to see her still getting out there after the embarrassment blue put her through!✌️ props to this lady❤️
I'm glad she's doing these interviews by herself and not in a toxic environment. We can finally see who she really is. Love this for her. <3
When he asked her what's the best way to quit a job and she said ""just quit fuck it"" I felt that 😂
Keep your head up Jaidyn. I always thought she was unproblematic, she just fell in love with a narcissistic scum bag.
I like Jaidyn shes actually super chill with a nice vibe.
Jaidyn is soo calm and fun. Knows how to hold a conversation.
I'm just glad she's doing a interview by herself for once 😂
I just love Jaidyn, she’s so chill ❤ I’d definitely love to see her with her own line of shades too
This is one of the most genuine interviews he’s had.

I honestly didn't realize just how dumb water witches looked until this video. I didn't realize it was so blatantly made up.
Great video.  The hotel is  looking really good.  The water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist.
It’s crazy to watch how much progress you’ve made since 2020 the town looks great
We love your videos Brent, they dont all have to be well planned like they all are. You could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same. Thanks for being a content creator
I'm not an expert hiker or trail blazer, but I think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail.  It would be safer for anyone that want's to see that beautiful view of the valley.  Keep up the fantastic work Brent.  I'm hoping to be able to get to Cerro Gordo within the next couple of years.  Till then, I look forward to more and more video updates!
Brent, you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer. Blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees (leaving stone cairns) on a route for others to follow. Looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in Oz. Happy festive season mate
There’s nothing I want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
There’s something magical about the Sierras. I was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at Lake Sabrina. You can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning. The calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless.
Yes! Dan is awesome! Love his channel so glad he’s made an appearance
Bravo, Brent!  I'm so proud to have watched your first episodes of ""Ghost Town Living"" way back in 2020.  I never stopped!  Best channel on You Tube!  It never gets old!  Thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride.  I WILL get to Cerro Gordo one day and visit.  Congratulations on a great month and Merry Christmas!
Hey Brent what you are doing at Cerro Gordo is just simply amazing. I am  a retired water treatment, production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and I am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history.  Thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos, I am envious of your accomplishments!!
Cerro Gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately, but I'd love to visit if I had the chance. Your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from. It's amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life, especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on.
I’ve been watching since before the hotel burnt down and I’m so glad that it’s being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
Brent, your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch I never miss an episode. I would love to visit one day I am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun . Maybe one day I could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully I can visit in the near future. Cheers
Brett, you are truly an inspiration to me, and I'm sure many others. I admire your commitment to you're amazing project that you have taken upon yourself with the help of others. you have outstanding perseverance!!
It pleases me to pre-order your book. I now feel like I am just a small part of your world. I hope to visit and meet you someday.
   It is amazing that you have found your place in this world. And even more amazing that you are preserving history.
Blessings to you and your passions!!!
I think hiking trails are a great idea, that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly. Some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too, especially once you get a good supply of water on tap. Then the town could serve as a base camp, so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies.
Wow, what an incredible journey exploring an abandoned ghost town! Your determination and enthusiasm for discovering hidden treasures like gold and water are truly inspiring. The way you uncover the history and explore the nooks and crannies of these forgotten places is both fascinating and captivating. Keep up the amazing work, and looking forward to more thrilling adventures like this one! and please release your book to indian market as well.",22,People & Blogs,1670000,PT34M2S

Chuck-E-Cheese has been DYING for years, but FNAF may have just put the final nail in the mouse's coffin. What has Chuck E. Entertainment been doing right? What has he been doing WRONG? And how can he capitalize on Five Nights at Freddy's for future success?

""is it true kids got stuffed in them?"" ""Do you know Fnaf?""
For those wondering, Scott said he wouldnt make FNAF a real thing as a park, restaurant, or anything like that because he's scared someone would make the games real to become famous or something
You know FNAF has messed you up when Matpat tells the story of a real guy and you treat it like a lore theory.
I think the main mistake a lot of ""family friendly"" companies are making is that they put way too much focus on being unoffensive to the parents. Theyre so careful not to give the parents any reason to *not* bring their kids to their restaurants, that they completely neglect to give the *kids* any reason to *want* to go in the first place. Would a FNAF event at Chuck E Cheese upset some parents? Sure. But kids would be *begging* to go check it out, and that would drum up so much more business than theyd potentially lose
Remember that Chuck E. Cheese was the actual main reason why FNAF happened in the first place. So I think the best thing Charles Entertainment could do is not only Collaborate Chuck E. Cheese with FNAF, but also possibly make a trip down memory lane to FNAF’s history and most Chuck E. Cheese’s history as well.
As a kid in the 90s the Chuck E Cheese animatronics were barely working and they were scary to me. Timeskip to now, and as someone who loves FNAF I would love to see a collab between FNAF and Chuck E Cheese. Heck I'm sure the kids going to Chuck E Cheese love FNAF
As someone who works at a Main Event as a technician, I can attest to the fact that maintanence and repair of attractions takes a lot of money, especially depending on what broke. If it's a lane, generally the parts are gonna be expensive due to the wear and tear they need to endure and how big they are, and with how pricey bowling is, they get paid for on that alone as bowling next to dining and scheduled events are the big money makers. Games on the other hand have to pay for themselves due to their high initial cost, and make their revenue based on who plays them throughout the day via game cards or tokens. If a part on a game breaks down, the cost of the part comes from how much it makes, so if a coin pusher breaks a motor, and the motor is $130 and the game makes $1000 a week, than it's an easy buy. If a shooter game has its gun break down and the gun is $900 but the game makes $500 a week, it's a lot harder to justify keeping the game, especially if its an old one. Another example would be if te game promotes a gimmick that contributes nothing to gameplay and is purely fun/cosmetic, if thst breaks down and te revenue the game brings in isn't enough to justify fixing the gimmick but the game works regardless, than it can be left operable just without that flashing light, more so if the gimmick continuously breaks. I imagine with big animatronic characters this kind of logistics is applied even more so, as they are an attraction but don't necessarily bring in their own revenue, they're just for show like a tv and rely on what the resturant earns to keep their upkeep in check.
*_The fact matpat still remembers fnac(five nights at candy) and mentions it is amazing_*
It’s actually interesting that Chuck E. Cheese was starting to file for bankruptcy similar to how FNAF kind of did it mostly in the first game. This possibly states that Chuck E. Cheese is now officially FNAF but in real time.
I think the problem they want to avoid is if they lean TOO HEAVILY into the fnaf side then some psycho might attempt to recreate the games irl. That’s exactly why Scott has said he doesn’t want really pizzerias.
I think instead of a partnership with FNAF, CC should invent their own game with their own lore and a fresh backstory.
No matter the reason, I think it's really sad that they're retiring the animatronics. Chuck e cheese was such a big part of my childhood and it won't be the same without them, even though I thought the animatronics were creepy back then
Let's be honest, FNAF didn't _make_ animatronics creepy, it just brought that sentiment to the forefront.
As a Chuck E. Cheese fan, this episode title sure did make me curious on how this topic would be covered LOL
Tbh I think a large portion of factors can be mentioned in regards to the animatronic band removal but it's still pretty tragic 
They used to have a slogan that said ""Make magic, without it we're just another pizza place!"" and now that feels bitter because of them removing the one thing that REALLY set them apart from anything else 
It's honestly quite a shame and as nice as it is that they're keeping the band at Northridge, that band has several issues that I doubt they'll fix anytime soon
I hope more stores keep their band [or more reopen with the band as a retro store gimmick] however it's all unpredictable at this point, tbh wouldn't surprise me if the brand itself dies within the next decade
Some Chuck E Cheese locations used to have interactive consoles where kids could look at different camera feeds placed around the restaurant. They should have kept those around to appeal to FNAF fans.
I would definitely prefer that we keep some tactile stuff like these animatronics around, there's just simply no comparing a screen and a physical robot the latter is WAY more fun, but uh I don't think fully going in on horror is the move here.
I'm amazed at how much business sense MatPat shows on food theory.
I remember going to chuck e cheese with my uncle as a kid. He worked with all sorts of technology so we always stayed after the place closed while he talked to the staff about the robots, lights, and sound system. I remember being right there on the stage and looking at the animatronics up close, and even being able to look at the ways they hid some of the animatronics that weren't working without removing them from the stage altogether. 

It is one of my favorite memories and I am truly saddened by the fact that they are getting rid of the animatronics
IMO, if they did make a FNAF-style eatertainment experience, I'd imagine it'd be a lot like the movie. The ""animatronics"" are actually guys in muppet suits, and during peak dining hours they close up the stage for supposed maintenance only for the stage to open up a few minutes later and reveal that one of the actors is just inexplicably gone.
Me being an employee at the billings CEC I completely agree with this! Our characters here in billings are 1 of the last 5 original 3 stage sets and no one i work with including the managers, want the characters gone. So im all for this. We as the fan base just need to step up and save the animatronics we all know and love!",26,Howto & Style,5010000,PT16M12S

#DemonSlayer #KimetsunoYaiba #Anime",2751,"this arc will be the calm before the storm
This arc is pretty cool, but manga readers all know how legendary the next will be
Edit: I think there will be one more arc after the next, or maybe just one big arc smushed together after this one
This is it guys, where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc, get yourself ready for what's coming next
This season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all 🔥
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc 😭 It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Hell yeah! Manga readers all know what's going to come next! The calm before the storm!!! 😤🔥🔥🔥
I can definitely see a lot of people not going like this arc due to the fact that it doesn't really have any great fighting sequence. But I don't care, The fact that this arc is the prime setup of one the greatest arcs in the entire series sends me shivers. Truly one of the ""calm before the storm"" moments.

And for any manga readers reading this, you know damn well that they are going to give us one of the biggest cliffhangers in the series, if you know what I mean.
Demon Slayer is absolutely a phenomenon to experience! It's been almost 5 years since the anime debuted and now after the the Hashira Training arc, we'll be officially 1 arc away (depending on how they animate the final one) from completing the anime. I remember watching the first episode only a few days after its release like it was just yesterday... I never imagined it would become this big!! I can't wait to experience all of what kny has before it ends ❤‍🔥
Happy to see all the Hashira in one frame. *2025 to Infinity Arc*
its crazy how big and popular Demon Slayer got in such a short amount of time!!
hyped for the new season!!
For manga readers out there, what im most excited for is when mitsuri is gonna explain how she got the mark. I LOVE THAT SCENE and cant wait to see the other hashiras backstory animated
A final happiness for us ds fans coz people are not ready for the next infinity castle arc its really gonna break the internet 🤧❤️🔥
I absolutely can not wait to see the arc after this get animated. It will be a legendary arc, and I get chills thinking about it.
This arc is gonna be awesome and can't wait next year
Tengen is sooooo beautiful here ❤❤❤❤❤ 
This arc in manga was pretty cool ! It will be the same in anime with a such good animation ! Thank u Ufotable ❤
My God, this masterpiece that I've been waiting for has finally come out, I don't know if the trailer is official for another hour? This is a dream.
This trailer gave me chills I am excited to know that the season will do.
It’s awkward to see there’s only 8 hashira’s right now.. And soon to be one 😭😭
BUT HEY!! THIS!? THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!🤗🤗
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc  It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Once this arc is over, now the real fun starts with some of the most epic fights/best story developments you've seen! (So excited for this to come along with the rest)",1,Film & Animation,703000,PT4M8S

Kass,
I have a little sister and it’s a pretty large age gap of 13 years. I just wanted you to know that what you are doing for your sisters is AMAZING and I look forward to the day that I can do the same for my little sister. Lots of people may consider it “spoiling”, but I consider it as an act of kindness because it is so fun to give and see their faces light up with excitement! Thank you for all the inspiration that you have given me ❤️❤️
I love how Kass is so kind to all of her sisters and always tries to include each of them! Also something from this video I would absolutely love is the ordinary hair serum, or the drunk elephant rosi drops!

My favorite thing that they got is either the Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter or the ordinary serum.

The ‘Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’ star was 29 years old.",820,"I can't believe that she's gone. She's been though a lot and she didn't deserve it. RIP ANNA.
As a Mom, my heart breaks for this young woman and her family. I know she is resting on the arms of the angels. May God watch over her family.
Praying so hard for the family, as someone who's lost so many to cancer. Rest in peace, Anna. 🙏💕
My heart goes out to her children! I'm proud of her for speaking out against her mother and her molester. People are shocked by the boldness of predators. They some how get a rush from doing things in plain sight! You should never trust anyone 100% with your children! It's so sad that she died at such a young age. But she did have a purpose to serve in her short life!
Ever since the beginning she’s been my favourite sister. She was so beautiful and smart, went through so much at a young age and got through it. Rest in peace to a kind beauty ❤
Prayers of comfort, love, and peace for her family and all who loved her 🙏🏾
Prayers for the little kids she's left behind. So tough to grow up without a mommy. My heart breaks for them.
*Feel so sorry for her. And dying because of cancer just makes this even sadder. RIP.*
This is heartbreaking news. It’s tragic to lose someone young, especially around the holidays and leaving behind small children, too. May her memory be for a blessing. 🕊️🕯️
Literally have a knot in my chest 😢 I'm happy she's not suffering, but I'll be praying for her babies, loved ones, and family ❤❤🙏
She broke the circle of abuse and neglect! I have a lot of respect for this young lady! RIP
I can't stop crying. This young lady is gone but not forgotten. I been watching her on Honey Boo Boo from the beginning. To find out that Anna passed away is heartbroken. 

MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES GOES OUT TO HER DAUGHTERS AND HUSBAND AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

Rest In Peace 🕊️🕊️🕊️ Anna you finally got your WINGS FLY HIGH.
My heart goes out to her family. My deepest condolences to her family.
My love goes out to her children and family. She has gained her angel wings and will always live on through their hearts.
We all know, that a parent should never have to bury their child. It's the most painful thing to go through. Godspeed, Anna..🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow, my condolences and 🙏🏾's to the entire family 😢.  This is so sad. She was so young. I hope this family stands together and doesn't  fall apart. I hope they stand strong and lean on each other. This is going to be a struggle for a while for this entire family. 😢 #RIPChickadee ❤
#RIPAnnaCardwell 😢❤
I lost my daughter in 2016 and it does get better knowing that she is in the arms of our Lord and Savior. 
Rest easy Anna.🙏🏿🕯️🍃
Ugh, that girl went through so much. She deserved better. I pray her little girls have the resources and support to get through this. My heart shattered when I heard Saturday was also her youngest’s birthday. Now that poor baby has to forever share her day with the anniversary of her Mama’s death. 💔❤️‍🩹
She is a beautiful soul. I am praying for her babies and loved ones. I pray they know she is watching over them and her love will never die. RIP Anna.
As a mother, as someone her age, I can’t imagine. This is heartbreaking. 💔 I know she didn’t want to leave her children. Much love and condolences to her family. May god give them the strength and guidance they need to move forward in life.",24,Entertainment,6410000,PT3M22S

I watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
Love how Olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance!  That applause was richly deserved.
guts was such a masterpiece! I can’t wait for next album! She literally never misses!
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances! 💜
This video demonstrates her creative ability so well. And how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass. ❤
Being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire, Olivia never ceases to amaze me 👏
Her breaking the glass part before the chorus is *FABULOUS* 💜💜💜
Also the scream part is WOW 😭😭😭 her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
This is exactly what I would imagine an official mv for this song would be like, and the fact that she performed it live... just perfecf ❤
ok this performance was a MOMENT. also love how she didn’t break character once the song was over and was getting applause. she stood in that ATTITUDE — tongue out, cake on the face, those *eyes* glaring at you, the intensity… so perfect!
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 💗
I love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager. Teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile we're happy and cheerful on the outside. And I love the scream so much 😂😂 Thanks Olivia 💜💜
This performance is insane, Olivia is such a hard worker. Her voice, her emotions, the way she looks is PERFECT. I’m so grateful I am a teenage girl because of Olivia
She's not just another pop queen.  Besides pop, her music has some angst and an edge to it, which is awesome.  This performance was fantastic.
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances!
Olivia entregando talento como sempre
Being a fan since Sour...this album blown away my expectations, and the performance are just brilliant. I´m a metal and rock listener and Olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music. Hope to see a show of her someday. Great work!!
MEU DEUS QUE PERFORMANCE, ela quebrando a taça na virada da música ficou incrível
i’m so proud of her and her improvement in performance. watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too. 

i’m glad i’m going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music. she saved me when the sour album dropped, it meant a lot to me, at that time i’m in my lowest point. sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better. her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty. 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand, i was 16 in my room all day and night. because of tracks on sour, i can accept my jealousy towards other girls, i can relieve my anger towards my ex-boyfriend. some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations, like his new girlfriend’s name sounds so much like mine, just slightly different.

i’m 18 now, i was so much happier than that time, i moved on. i forgive and forget. i have a lot of new friends and good memories. i got into a university and my studying great. just like she said she’s so much happier than the time when she wrote sour. i’m so happy for her and myself. 

hope she can do tour in my country!
please come to Asia. thank u!

#OnePiece #Wano #Crunchyroll",1233,"I'm glad they showed off the seraphim's introduction as a threat because it really set the tone of how strong they truly are.
I like that Blackbeard is a villain who shows concerns and vulnerabilities.
He makes him more human and believable than the typical untouchable villains who seem to have everything under control like a god.
I like how this shows an emperor can even have a hard time dealing with the new pacifista
After years of being told ""you aren't ready for what's about to come"", I can confidently say ""yes, I am indeed, not ready""
Blackbeard is so unlikeable but that’s also what makes him such a good villain. I can’t wait to see his rematch with Luffy in the future 🤩
I am a Blackbeard stan. The dude is hilarious, powerful, opportunistic, and cowardly. ""Did you all get beaten by just one brat?!"" - pure comedy. Clearly the kid ain't normal boss 🤣😭
If this is what S-Hawk can do, imagine what Mihawk can actually do...
Dude, I still remember these chapters as if it was yesterday. Oda was straight cooking with hot grease!
If the Seraphims are modelled after the Warlords, it would be interesting to see Teach fight a younger version of himself
You know it's an abomination against nature because it has Mihawk's face but made an expression that wasn't a perma scowl or a delighted smirk
Blackbeard is shown to be a bumbling drunk at times but that man knows his lore and history in the One Piece verse, unlike most characters. He immediately picked up on the Lunarian traits
I cannot stress enough how refreshing blackbeard is as a villain knowing that he’s still exploring, growing, and making moves rather than just being a stagnant force like a lot of other OP villains have been
Considering that these new Seraphim-Pacifistas have biological qualities to them, it is likely that they are capable of getting stronger and learning from their previous fights as they age. So, if S-Hawk was to fight Blackbeard again, it would be better equipped and adapted to deal with him - much like Mahoraga from JJK🤔🤔
Watch episode 1087 here! https://got.cr/cc-op1087
Reminder that Blackbeard’s Dark-Dark Fruit makes all incoming attacks that hit him hurt more than it would any normal guy. Pre-timeskip he would’ve been crying out in pain and reeling on the floor. Just goes to show that even against a Seraphim Blackbeard wasn’t doing nothing for two years; he’s even more of a tank than ever.
I really like how they made the Seraphim completely silent. Really makes them feel otherworldly
Blackbeard has levelled up dramatically. He took on a slice that cut a mountain like butter, then blocked the next attack with his Haki. All this in spite of his DF amplifying the pain he feels.
Interesting enough to see Blackbeard dodging and moving swiftly pre time skip he would usually be a sitting duck to most attacks.
Blackbeard calling him big is right on point. If he is that size as a child and still developing, imagine how enormous and deadly they would be as adults. These pacifista are a potential threat for everyone not controlling them.
Love how Blackbeard is portrayed here. He's on the move and highly aware of his surroundings with quickly examining the new pacifistas. The Seraphim proved to be extremely powerful but Blackbeard held his own the entire time and maintained control of the situation. Even Whitebeard said he is always unprepared but that's how he rolls.",1,Film & Animation,5410000,PT1M48S

Can you find Bryton in each round before we do?
My challenge was crazy!! And I am so happy that Bryton is back home! ❤
So great to have Bryton back! I hope you guys can find him in the impostors! 😬
YES!!! I cannot wait to see what videos you guys make now that Bryton’s finally back. The channel is amazing, but it just wasn’t the same without him. I really hope you another Dino smashers video or one of those videos where it feels like you’re actually there. Those are awesome
5:05, Payton's comment and Ashton's reaction are so funny. Love you 🥰
Welcome back, Bryton. It's not the same without you, the best Ninja ever.
Amazing to have the blue ninja  back
Welcome back Bryton, and also when Payton said Ashton's muscles were a little small Ashton's face was hilarious.
I miss Bryton so much, so good to see him again
Let’s appreciate how much effort it takes to make these videos❤.  Great job guys!
How fun! Congrats Bryton on all your good work!
So happy you're home!
Its good to see you back with family...even when they were making videos without you...we felt a missing space there, I wonder how you managed to survive all these days without family as you have done everything with them ❤😊 . Like what Payton said and made Ashton mad😅 lol
So funny, especially when Ashton was in it😂
The prank you did to ur family, put a smile on my face ❤
The twist at the end was so so funny. I can't stop 😆
Brayton shares a close bond with his family. I'm overjoyed that he may return home.
its awesome to see that you still have a strong bond
I’m so happy Bryton is back!🎉",19,Travel & Events,2490000,PT35M24S

is an exchange that will stay with me until the end of days. Also, ""Transphobiosa"" has me deader than Harry's parents 💀💀
Mother has mothered again
Sam hitting his head on the question block has got to be the funniest thing I've seen in a long time
You know it's gonna be a great day when Brandon uploads
I never knew that a minute long video could make me laugh so hard.  True comedic genius.
Sam is the type of homie everyone needs in their lives
Sam is what my anxiety will never allow me to do in public 💀
The way Brandon has no fear of being judged in public is just honestly incredible
""I thought you was dead!""
""Well honey legends never die!""
""That's.. that's total bullshit.""

DYING
I hope Brandon never stops dropping bits like this lol. I love the longer videos but bits like this are amazing for the ADHD brain.
“These trolls got holes” got me down on the floor dying out of laughter when you said! Brandon don’t stop what you’re doing!
1:07 That was just such a genuine reaction from Donna 😂
I wish I could fall asleep as fast as Sam can.😅
Also, Donna saying she can’t connect to the internet is super relatable.😂
Sam and Donna is the ultimate dynamic duo and I always love seeing them together
holy shit ""transphobiosa"" fucking hit me like a pile of bricks, literally laughed so hard i started seeing stars in my vision. (or maybe i would've seen stars anyways because there's something wrong with my eyes lol) just completely out of nowhere. i swear i can never get tired of this stuff, it's just too good.
The amount of confident this guy has to go into all these places just to say this stuff will never not make me smile. A modern comedic legend
okay, I love how you can tell that they are purposefully not talking loud, because of all the people around, but they still make their words clear, well done and absolutely hilarious
I love how fans were coming up and he just continued to stay in character 💀you are an absolute wonder, Brandon..
I hope Brandon and Paulette had a blast making this! I laughed so hard, I had to watch twice because I missed parts of it!
“These trolls got holes!” IS CRAZYYYY!!!

But I’m so glad that Brandon uploaded! It’s always a good day when that happens! 💕",10,Music,6580000,PT1M44S

I made this an in depth as possible to answer ALL of your questions; hopefully I got them all. Which Hero Equipment will you be using for your strategy? 

Town Hall 16 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLetRAmF0nLxuVjlriV36YCaqNA4VJYZtm
Here's the thing, the new wall levels take 9M for a single piece. But there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls, 4 which can shoot over walls. There is a jump and an earthquake spell, 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
I actually like this change because for me, the archer queen's spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible.
Im a little concerned about the epic equipment. Especially if its tied to events. It kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available.
I'm suspicious of the Epic equipment. If they are only available from special events, and much better than regular equipment, there's potential balance issues.
2:43 those Ore numbers are spectacular
Clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change. Absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes. Thank you Judo for always keeping us updated with juicy COC contents ❤❤.
I think this is really cool but I am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level. I really hope that levelling up your gear doesn’t take ages and ages. 

Additionally, I am VERY afraid of having “epic” gear that’s limited. I really hope that isn’t something that’s done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get. Anything limited atm is purely aesthetic, and doesn’t impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else. I hope they keep that in mind
I hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking, so you could startegize even further
for me, this is just an amazing feature, and something I would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects (cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops), by that knowledge, I think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic (like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that)
The vampire mustache, rage crystal, and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable. 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if DPS gets too high… can’t wait to try it out
Great stuff as ever! Will you be doing an upgrade priority guide? I know with most new TH levels it's the usual routine of TH, Lab, CC, Storages, Army Camps etc but this feels very different (and exciting!) e.g. with the Blacksmith. Would love some guidance.
I really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately. For instance, using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
It’s nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th16/15 changes
Thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo. Appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
Explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation, thanks!
With the epic equipment for events, as long as it doesn’t require money to get I think will be such a good idea. Make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
This is so awesome, its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new content.These are gonna change the game a lot, and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears.
This is phenomenal & provides you with ample content opportunities!  You could make a playlist of current & old strategies and how to gear the heroes to update/enhance those strats!  I'll be watching!",20,Gaming,2730000,PT19M30S

Without body you look like rayman... considering he's apparently a secret agent and extremely cool. Using his floating detatched hands really effectively. That's a compliment... but you lost your ""looking like one of the strongest video game characters"" status when you got arms... also it was in an anime. So cool. Rayman is an anime character now.

Why does Dev always get the most infuriating challenges...? 😂😂😂😂
You know it’s gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
Dev started as a hunter, and when he got detached, he still decided to be speed runner XD
I would love to try some of these challenges myself. They seem fun. But my computer can barely handle running Minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting, never mind multiplayer high paced PVP related stuff. Also, I can’t speedrun, so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this.
I love how intense this video was, and then the end was the most anti-climactic thing ever
“it was supposed to be fun.. like friends work together.” actually kinda hit me in the feels. feels bad man
Kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isn't a bad twist, imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
You know, I'd love to see a Manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking. I.e. Trading doesn't give pearls. Enderman only spawn in the overworld. Water+Lava source gives cobble. And have Dev be the speedrunner. Maybe then he'd be Kier's speed <3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions. in a good way, of course
I'm so glad boosfer finally agreed to do a manhunt
This is my favorite color crew video in awhile. It was very funny and a completely different unique idea compared to most manhunt twists currently. Also having Boosfer in a manhunt must have taken a lot of bribe money.",20,Gaming,1100000,PT21M40S

#DougDoug #skyrim #mod",15153,"We all know the reason chat makes Doug’s heart rate increase is because Doug loves us
Doug's heart rate being 20bpm lower than mine shows that a well oiled heart is important
Chat:”Doug do a small dance” *Doug proceeds to dance violently knocking down his green screen*
There is never a moment where you feel disconnected from Doug, his viewer interaction is Completely Unmatched
The way chat just said “let him cook” well they were playing rock, paper, scissors was hilarious
I'm amazed he kept his heart rate down when CHEESEWHEEL GAMING was on screen. What a trooper.
Don’t you just love Doug’s CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments? Fucking incredible
I sure do love it when Dough pours his CHEESEWHEEL GAMING all over his viewers
The voice for the spawning bot is perfect
I love the part where Doug said CHEESEWHEEL GAMING and he cheesewheeled all over us
My favorite part of the video is when Doug said “ITS CHEESEWHEEL GAMING TIME”, and CHEESEWHEEL GAMINGing on all the bad guys
I love how much effort Doug puts into his
CHEESEWHEEL GAMING videos
The harmonious ending supporting Doug's venture was truly CHEESEWHEEL GAMING so inspirational
as always doug never fails to deliver content to us. big CHEESEWHEEL GAMING content there
I love that Chat decided to play along and spawn an army in that rush to Dragon's Bridge!
I was at the edge of my seat when that CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moment happened. Good thing Doug stayed so calm!
All of Dougs' CHEESEWHEEL GAMING videos are truly an artistic masterpiece.
Love how Doug's CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments are always amazing to watch even while having so much cheese.
It was a real experience to watch this live. The tragedy of so many lives lost to trucks will never be forgotten, and we will always have CHEESEWHEEL GAMING to remember them by.

The fact that the Lego mode came out 2 days ago proves that Lazar can make videos in that time frame.

We’ve caught him.
The fact that Lannan is happy and healthy enough to do uploads so quickly really brings me joy! Really gives early Lazar vibes!
I find it hilarous that Lazar can screw around with literally anything his heart desires.
Hands down one of the best gamemodes we’ve gotten
Always gonna be a good day when Lazar uploads 🔥🔥
Lazar never fails to break any game within 12 hours of its release
Poor ceeday getting roasted 😭
Lazar being this consistent feels unreal.
It's truly legendary that Lazar is still using the gingerbread skin despite there being a *LITERAL SKIN* of him
Your creativity in this Lego Fortnite video is off the charts, just like the designs in ytgw0010. Truly inspiring work!
So cool thing about these Golems is that they're not actually Desert-specific? Either that, or they change colour according to whichever biome they're in.
Lazar complaning about ceeday not uploading with his upload schedule is criminal
The difference in the amount of time that Lazarbeam streamed and the and the amount of time this video is just proves how much he cares about us to be entertained
Lazar always finds a way to break every game in existence.
I have to say this, but this felt like an old lazarbeam video. I love just the goofy ideas and music it makes me happy to see this kind of content again. Thanks Lannan!

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg. im sure they were so happy that he joined them, soooo adorable
Ryan risked losing his Apple Watch just to test a review. Mad respect
The fact that Ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane.
I was cracking up from start to finish. Thanks man, I needed that 😂
I always worry about content creators' ettiquette when they're recording in public. It fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers :)
I went on the Harry Potter ride many times, but this one time I did actually get stuck for a few minutes. The people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so I could go on again without waiting. I have to say it was worth it 👍
Watching Ryan and his dad have fun at the place they've talked about going together for so long is really heart-warming <3
As someone who's been to Universal Studios once and loved every second of it, I was shocked to learn it had such a low review score. I guess the waiting just doesn't bother me that much, since I'm already used to Disneyland waiting time.
I don't know why but asking the kid if she knew Janelle made me laugh so hard. And then you saying she is upset and the kid going ""oh""... comedy gold.
*Ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist! 🎉*
I love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh. 😂
Universal Studios is very popular so there is a reason why it’s so packed and that the lines are so long. There really isn’t anything the workers can do to change that. The main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line. Some lines are kinda crazy. Of course there are a few rides in the Harry Potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties. The ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride. Whenever I’ve gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
Ryan Trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content, he took this to an absolute infinity win.
I agree with Mark, we got stuck on the Harry Potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out. I was scared and didn't know anybody else on the same coaster. So, I just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere.
i watch your videos on regular days, but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad. i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better. thank you ryan
Ryan never fails to make me smile 😁
I just love how ryan talks to people without being hesitated or nervous :)

WE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  

We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.

Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  

We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.

Our journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity

© Gone With the Wynns 2023",1447,"Jason is getting a dishwasher…Congrats on the new boat. Looking forward to all the new adventures.
Tool Time with Tim was everything! Sorry for the delay! I can’t wait to be virtually sailing with you guys!
Love Y’all!Home Improvement was one of my favorite programs! Can’t wait to see y’all’s first sailing video on the open water!!!!
It’s a process you wouldn’t want any other way but to be right.  Enjoy the journey ❤️ Hugs for overcoming the challenges ⛵️
This is fantastic, it’s about time - good people deserve good things!
Dear Jason and Nikki, Congrats on this most crucial of all milestones: perfect flotation! She looks STUNNING! I hear your frustration and sense your months of inner exhaustion, from anticipating her birth and yet, despite your readiness, she's gonna be born when she is ready, not when anyone else is ready. But that's the beauty of it!! It will ALL cone true, and all be worth it! Meanwhile, luckily you two are incredibly practiced at unpredictable waiting. It's one of your superpowers! You're just stuck in the world's most unpredictable weather window right now, waiting to depart, but the weather keeps changing, and it's all out of your control. May you draw on your inner strength! It's expectation -- the set up and the disappointment -- that makes it so emotionally exhausting to you. For us? We're just here for the ride, and we're not going anywhere. So *please* don't worry about pleasing anyone other than yourselves! May you just do what you need to do to take care of you. Sending support and all the positive energy from across the world. ❤Lee
We started with travel trailers and are now building a boat, pretty much because of you guys. We took your advice to heart and have learned to sail and are building up our miles and skills before we pick up our own boat. Great to see how this whole process is unfolding. Took last week’s break as an opportunity to go back and watch your first couple of months of sailing videos- how far you have come!
Limbo living is always such a challenge.  I’ve experienced it a few times in my 77 years and I now know it was a teaching/learning time for me. I admire the way you two are handling it all with such grace and putting it to good use. So very eager to see the next step! I’ve been following you since your very early RV days and it’s always been a joy. Peace to you both. ❤
I noticed no props or bottom paint so then realized the process is ongoing. I was able to watch the commissioning of our new monohull sailboat back in the day. A very interesting and exciting process indeed. Congratulations and glad to see they are making sure everything is done correctly.
Love all your videos! This build has been an adventure to watch (can just imagine what your ""adventure"" feels like). As to e-bikes, I'm a private pilot and have a few pilot friends that have e-bikes they ftake on their aircraft (so lightweight, foldable, relatively small package when folded, durable, etc.).. They've recommended Stark Drive, Montague M-E1 and Brompton e-bikes. Not sure if any fit your specs/needs, but may be worth at least a look.
Your episodes NEVER fail to leave us with anticipation of the next one. Fascinating process. I was intrigued by the stepp ed process of checking systems and installing panels in a particular and necessary order. Thanks for the invitation, looking forward to the next video. Be well Niki and Jason, real close to sailing this jewel on your own....can't wait for those episodes.
I'm sure I can speak for many of your fans in saying, we love you! I understand it can be hard large life events going not quite so perfectly. I've gone through some similar things building a barn. But I know the wait is going to be worth it, you'll be so happy. We're all here to support the both of you as you follow your dreams, through the good, the bad, and the delayed. I know it can be hard but keep keeping your heads up, you should be proud.
I'm so excited for you and can also feel and see your disappointment on yet more delays. Thank you for showing us the reality and some of the emotion behind all of this. I'm eagerly awaiting next week's episode. Thank you for taking us on this journey with you.
It is all just a part of the journey of building our own boat. The more you are there, the more you learn, and the better you will know your own boat. Thanks for letting us be a part of your lives.
Congratulations on getting the boat in the water for the first time. That was so exciting.
You two are so down to earth in contrast with your shiny new yacht it’s a beautiful thing ❤we need more stories about reasonable people making it ❤
You guys are awesome!  It’s amazing the time and thought you put in to making great videos!  Keep up the great work!!😊
Sorry that you've had so many things to challenge your happiness, but great job of presenting the realities of this process.  Looking forward to seeing y'all on board and testing everything out ahead of your future great adventures.
I have been watching your videos for several years, and find them so very interesting. Watching how much you have learned and accomplished is highly entertaining. Thank you!!

her vocals have improved so much better since Drivers Licence!
Her voice, her passion, her act , her melody, her story , her visual, everything about her is just perfect.
Imagine singing this live without backing tracks and just with your raw voice, this was absolutely hard!! Hats off to Olivia
her vocals, her high notes, literally everything about her is amazing.
her vocals is so amazing both live and in the studio
Olivia's vocals (live or studio) never fail to amaze me. This quiet but powerful version is amazing
This song is really hard to sing and I applaud her courage to sing this live❤
Was her singing perfect here? No. 
Did her singing move me? Yes
Her delivery, the lyrics, the piano, it moved me and I love her live versions of vampire.
I was so surprised to see she had no earpiece, she did so well!!!  What I really don´t understand though is people saying her ""vocals have improved so much"" like huh? She has always been this good live, maybe her confidence grew and her vocal techniques got better but she´s always been an incredible live performer.
Love this! Her talent has bloomed so dramatically in the past 10 years. Videos like this prove this to be true.
her voice is so perfect and angelic! love you Olivia XOXO can’t wait to see you in concert
her vocals really improved so much from the past years, great job mother liv!!!
Ik she has some voice cracks in this but the fact that she still sounds amazing live says something!! She sounds just like how she does in studio recordings. And nobody should hating on her for having voice cracks in her live performances, every singer has them sometimes, so don’t hate on our amazing Liv!! 💜
Olivia conveys so much emotion in every song. I love seeing artists perform with no gimmicks. Just a beautiful girl and her piano. Well done!
The amount of talent she has at 20!! I can't wait to see what she does in the upcoming years
What a trip. The comment section is totally astroturfed by bots. She was a little off key a few times and the sh-sh-sh style of vocals is unnecessary but it was a great performance. No auto tune is a good thing. Hearing mistakes makes it better because it’s genuine.
this performance feel so real, like her vocals expressions and just genuine felling in this performances is by far the best she's ever done
A voz dela é simplesmente incrível
Love this slow, intimate piano rendition of her song! A completely different take that felt more hurtful and somber. Just goes to show what a good actress she is",10,Music,201000,PT4M1S

Alan deserves an Oscar award
The Cowboy hat was clever. At first I thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until I realized it also was there to contextualize TSC's rotational position in 3D space, since otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape, which most of them were.
If you could turn this format into a video game, you'd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics.
Please never stop doing these. Biology, Chemistry, Logic, History, anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation. Thank you.
For a spiritual seeker physics student, this is emotional❤
As a physics student I can say that this is amazing! I see we’re going for an “interstellar” interpretation of singularities, which is cool to see as well.
Alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
This was absolutely stunning to watch. I can’t wait to see what comes next!

Maybe an “Animation VS Chemistry”? 

Chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise, and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts.
Genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts. It's like a whole season of Bill Nye compressed to the size of a single episode. You would make an excellent teacher
As a guy who loves physics, I absolutely love this, from classical mechanics to general relativity, then quantum mechanics. Alan and his team are do amazing job at this
One of the most relaxing videos I have ever seen. Proud to say I learned something from this, and glad to know I get to exist at the same time as this. All the work you've done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given.
Absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation. I absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works, keep up it up! You and your team are absolutely amazing!
Woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown! Just like in Math, Physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity, acceleration, friction, gravity and many more. I honestly love how you visualize every details that some people don't know which is crazy. I remember learning Physics during my high school years until college. I know that it sounds really difficult to understand but I'm sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics. Thank you so much, Alan Becker and the whole team for making this animation. I hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals. 🤯👍
I'm loving these new new animations.  There is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time.

Amazing job and I can't wait to see what's next!
As a Civil Engineering major (junior), this and ""Animation vs. Math"" have brought me to tears. BOTH of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why I'm still passionate about what I'm studying. Thank you <3
This is one of the most impressive things I've seen on YouTube in a while. Respect to the team behind it.
This is by far my favorite animation on this channel, it’s so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully. You deserve a damn Oscar for this
Spectacular animation, as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that I've learned, and for the ones that I have yet to learn, it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction, the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is, and why it is being used in the manner that it is. One particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist, for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort, the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there, and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions.
This video was a masterpiece from start to finish. It has wonderful animation, a mere loud story, the way you played with lighting and music was genius, and it shows the way physics work in a marvellous and fun way, both what we know and what we don’t. 10/10.",1,Film & Animation,25500000,PT16M8S

So thank you! Keep doing what you’re doing!

The sounds effects are so satisfying!
There's something I've dreamed of seeing in blox since I started playing, collision between attacks. Being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible, using the ice X to stop attacks for example. This would definitely change the blox combat style, as well as making it more complex and, in my opinion, interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful.
I personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island I think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled ""Tree Top"".
the Z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender, X move is lookin like the best combo starter, fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer, F is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage, (Base)

(Mode)
riding is ultimate furry (half joking lol)
Z move looks alot better, fits the transformation
X move is honestly worse than non mode X, range is way to short and can only be used as an extender, but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
C move is practically the same, just more aoe and (probably) damage
F move is just a slightly better version of itself, not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

Opinion: Is leopard better? yes and no, leopard is more spammy than kitsune, but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo, honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

Bonus: Fox lamp
Z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it, 
X (tap) good extender with seemingly good damage
X(hold) imo worse than tap X but better for aoe

Is it better than the best sword aka Cdk? No, it has potential but cdk has more combo potential (and most likely more damage)

I wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol

The devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
Most visually pleasing fruit imo. Hope for more much better updates to come. Been playing this quite a while and although I hate grind games, this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games I've ever played.
I wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless. I do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
Moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations. I am looking forward to using this fruit in the future!
This seems to be a good anti-teamer fruit. Flashy, incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others. Plus I see amazing combo potential with Kitsune and Fox Lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
I started playing Blox fruits a while back and Blox Fruits has really stepped up their game. They have recently come out with Update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new Max level- this new Max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play. They also definetly know what they are doing. They always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often. This update 20 came out somewhat around the time of One Piece Live Action which means that when players watch One Piece Live Action they might understand more about Blox Fruits and want to play. Well done Blox fruits :)
I think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon. I hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion.
I love this fruit and all the mechanics, the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers. Can't wait for the Dragon And Control Rework!!

It would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragon's moves just to see if they are worth buying

*Let's just appreciate how much a lot of time Gamer Robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day, huge respect!* 😆 👍
When transforming like a fox, maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler!😊
Maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work!😄😄
I think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run / skycamp with tbh
the other mythical needs to keep up with the kitsune fruit which means every mythic needs a buff and others rework",20,Gaming,2870000,PT11M26S

I find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because I still see them every year.
We loved having you and your team out to the Electric Starship Arcade. Thank you for hanging out with us Hope!
As an American Girl Doll collector, you did AMAZING at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls. I’m so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again!
As a professional baker, i’ve made a barbie cake like that before. A few tips for the next time, wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in, less mess that way, also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 😊
Love how you called the newer Polly Pocket's clothes 'chewy'. 😂
I could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the Mary-Kate and Ashley mall game. I would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood!!
Hey Hope! That Polly was original but the castle is actually a Star Castle! I had that exact one. Equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely it's own vibe ✨️
As a kid, I had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s Samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what I was working toward. After months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house, she was finally mine! 😊
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my Target for Halloween this year. They bring them back every year for the holiday, so I was surprised to see them in here lol
I had the tiny Polly Pockets and Rollerblading Kira!! She was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything. The essence of 1991. I had no idea they were discontinued, but they basically work just like a lighter lol 😂
I wanted a Samantha doll more than anything as a kid. Her books were the reason I started to love to read ❤️
I love seeing how far Hope has come I remember watching y’all her videos in order and I would get sooo excited when I got a notification saying she posted and I still get as excited.I wish you good luck on reaching 4M.
I was 30 in 2004, but the Mary Kate & Ashley game still got me. The graphics were crazy, lol. I remember my children wanting some of these items, lol. Thanks, Hope!😊
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
Actually loving all the background changes in this video ❤ it made it much more animated and fun!
I legit had that rollerblade Barbie!! She was my favorite! I also think AG dolls were better overall quality when Pleasant company was still in control. The most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing. Everything was so true to life with little clasps and now it’s all cheap Velcro but for the same price .. also the dolls were made in Germany back then .. not China.
I wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious & I love seeing childhood products I never got to have. if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
For the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones, you can find them at target. It made me so happy to see 😊
My daughter actually loves Polly Pockets! They make them in different varieties now. There are ones with the “chewy” clothes lol. Another with the hinge bodies, and others with plastic/silicone forms called Micro Polly- that’s the small compact versions. ❤️❤️",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S

You’re definitely right Dave, about Lauren having options 😅😂
I'm glad to hear you have managed to find a suitable car to cut up for this epic build, now the fun can really start 🔥🔥
That long wait and look for that one specific vehicle is always a great feeling once you are able to find it!
Congrats Dave! Excited to see this build once it finished.
Shoutout to August for hooking it up all the time. Coming in clutch and then the simple “it’s done” 🤣
Nice, now Dave can finally begin his dream build. Excited to see this one. Make the interior extra “boujee”👌🏻🔥
DDE!! Another banger. Congratulations Dave can't wait to see the final build
I genuinely can't wait for this 1. Thanks to Mike and August!
This is gonna be awesome! Cannot wait ! Thanks for all the daily uploads DDE team! Much love DDE FAM❤
Loving the content. A true daily fix ,  never gets old awesome to see the Gorgeous Lauren. Cant wait to see the Bentley come to life.  Mad love to you all.
Amazing. I can't wait to see it go through the processes. Congratulations Dave (and also to the rest of the crew). Lots more excitement is on the way. Cheers
Love to see the steady updates boys. Keep up the great work.
Congrats Dave! I'm stupid excited to see this build! Love the combination of luxury and because race car!!!! This is going to be an epic build!
This is gonna be awesome! Cannot wait ! Thanks for all the daily uploads DDE team! Much love DDE FAM
I can’t wait to see what you do to the 599. After you switched wheels with Damon and did the manual swap I started to really like that car. It would look sick with a kit and a huge wing.
I'm actually pumped for this build since you are hyping it up so much. I'd like to see some mods done on the interior as well though.
I couldn't be more excited about this Bentley build. Dave has really helped to make DDE a household name. I truly love ysob's
The final product better look absolutely out of this world cool! It looks like it might look overly bulky with a kit. Good luck to you guys!
Congratulations Dave! Can't wait to see this being driven!",2,Autos & Vehicles,3880000,PT33M36S

Brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
is it just me or is barley's animation different? looks crazy cool ngl 3:28
Finalmente uma skin em homenagem a nós brasileiros
I think it would be cool if you made a brawler where you transform into a second character with the ultimate. This means that at the beginning you are, for example, a melee fighter and then with the ultimate you are a thrower
The star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past. The fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all..
Здравствуйте Суперселл хотел бы задать вопрос. Будет ли или будут даваться компенсация или мифические - легендарные стар дропы игрокам которые уже собрали эти награды до обновления? (речь идёт о 15 - 30к которые у меня сейчас на основном аккаунте)
Hello! Dear Supercell! I would like chests to return to the game in the future, because chests are what gives people emotions, motivation and is an advantage in the game! Playing without chests has become a bit boring! Prizes are very good gifts, but they lack the intrigue and those emotions that were once before. If we digress a little from the topic, then we can say with confidence thank you so much for the update. I really liked it!!!! I look forward to the same cool and informative updates in the future!!!!

They should do this w male best friends. a bro-off. i feel like it could actually get quite interesting to see the dynamics of male friendships.
It's awesome that Cody is hiring from his fan base. There are so many talented people out there who just haven't been given the chance to show off their work on a larger scale !
seeing ppl fight over who is smarter never fails to be insanely cringe and dumb
That’s literally so likable of that girl to admit that she was a bit spoiled
I love women but Eve seems so boy crazy thats shes willing to throw her friends under the bus for male validation
Eve saying that she felt like Sadie wasn’t over it is STRANGE since Eve seemed like the one who was still upset
It’s interesting Eve and Sadie said there’s no jealously but Eve seems like she has repressed envy of Sadie and serious self-esteem issues. Any woman who goes out of their way to be sexual with a man they know their friend has been or is interested in is not your real friend.
I don’t see how Sadie can still blame her ex about this situation. YOUR friend is in the wrong. Not because of his manipulation or whatever, but because SHES a bad friend. Eve can try to sugar coat it as much as she wants but it’s a two way street
the nerve of eve to look so irritated at the other girl telling the story but what she did was 10x worse😭
Eve's was toxic because it was entitlement behavior. She may or may not be a completely entitled princess, or she may be a sporadic one, but that was unmistakably entitled behavior.
I just know Eve is the type of friend who’s secretly always wishing for Sadie’s downfalls. I think this is a lot more common than people realize or are willing to admit about female friendships—society pits women against each other and all that jazz—but most of us grow out of that mentality by like…high school at the latest. I hope this is a wake up call for Eve and motivates her to do some self reflection and work on her insecurities.
its the way eve seemed still angry about what happened with sadie and her ex when she was fully lying about her and sadies ex hooking up only once
I don’t get how she can put all the blame on her ex for cheating on her because she’s not surprised he acted that way after learning how he was but completely doesn’t even blame her best friend for purposefully sleeping with him multiple times. As if it wasn’t a betrayal on both of their parts.

i was being extra girly today and this was exactly what i needed to curl my hair with confidence. thank you for being a girls' girl Cody.
The girl constantly making excuses for why her ex is the sole problem, and absolving her friend of any wrongdoing like it doesn’t take two to cheat bums me out
Eve literally hooked up with her friends boyfriend multiple times but Sadie kissed eves ex ONCE and she is clearly still bitter about it ??? Did anyone else notice that?
eve is giving cassie from euphoria. just so desperate for male validation and attention that she would betray her best friend to get that attention
as someone who doesnt have a best friend anymore, i feel like it would be super entertaining to watch the same thing, but if it were ex-best friends. it would be so funny to watch them get asked questions and be passive aggressive or even straight up aggressive lmao",22,People & Blogs,2050000,PT49M34S

i loved that kurtis reverted back to POC women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt POC women. an ally through and through
""How dare thee call me a wizard"" has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
I don't think I'm ready for the Barbie vs. Bratz series to end.
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i haven't skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a Barbie girl from childhood to now, I am PRAYING for a new and/or “remake” of the Bratz live-action. Barbie was PHENOMENAL for what it was, imagine what we could have with BRATZ?! And to add: we NEED a better monster high live-action. I said what I said.
So glad the microchips line that's been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves.
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece. it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
Literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved Lifesized as much as many of us did.
Congratulations on being sponsored by Pokémon!!! So proud and happy for you!!
As a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with Bratz
Glad the “you dont have a daddy OR a bankaccount” line got the recognition it deserves. Been on my mind for years 😭💀
as a hispanic person, yasmin's part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
You should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more, please and thanks. Target audience reached.
idc how “bad” the bratz live action is, it will always be part of my core memories

Danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
For me, Barbie in the Nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation.
I would just like to point out that Danny’s little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker. It’s a toy soldier.

I could not take it with the dad’s reaction to the pebble I was laughing so hard. The blank stare, the trembling hands. The concerned look from his wife. Like what could this rock have possibly done to you?? Why do they never talk about it again??
I love how what started as a quirky and unconventional Nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left Danny with more questions than answers about the original tale.
Fun fact: This movie was funded by literal Russian state and was the most expensive Russian movie to date.
Ill be honest, as a ballerina, just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was _hysterical_
I would GLADLY watch you review ballets! Swan Lake has like 4 different endings, i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives.
As a ballerina, watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious. Especially when you referred to Fritz as ""this little freak"".
That end bit scared me so bad. I actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat. Seeing Danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing I've witnessed in a while
It's nice to see Danny hasn't lost his Christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen.
Can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with Danny's toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass.
I laughed so hard I fell off my bed when he said ""He misses his pebble.""
I'm honestly surprised that Danny didn't make the connection that Love on a Leash ALSO had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form. Now I just wanna know if there's any more movies with characters like that
What a stunning cast... Baby Elle Fanning, Snowbell from Stuart Little, and Moaning Myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of The Nutcracker the world's ever seen...
Hiring Albert Einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex I've ever seen.
Thank you for watching the ballet Danny! Sincerely, every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the Nutcracker
My little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago. I rented this for her hoping she'd love it. I feel so bad 😥🤕
In all the versions of the nutcracker I've seen, Drosselmeyer has a clown/assistant guy with him not a child. I've always loved the energy of just showing up to a family event with your clown friend who doesn't break character the entire time.",23,Comedy,6360000,PT28M49S

The horror/comedy combo of the masked in the ship repeatedly walking over the Whoopie cushion 😂😂
No intro, straight to business. Perfection.
Masked: A creepy figure which takes over the body of the individual it possesses like a parasite, forcing them to turn against their teammates to spread the mask

Nutcracker: lmao shotgun
It would be fun if the mask gives you some incredible power (temporarily see monsters through walls, temporarily see loot through walls, etc), but with an increasing chance of becoming ""possessed"" with each use.
The Masked is actually a great way to implement the mimic idea. They didnt lean too much into the horror and too much into the comedy and fits the game perfectly.
Hey Wurps, I know you probably won't see this but I really wanna state how helpful each video of yours has been. All are very informative and I've learned more tricks than I can count with your help. Keep making more!
The spray can is very useful. I remember an old indie game called ""erie"" had it as a mechanic to remind yourself where the exit at
I love the asthmatic of comedy/tragedy masks, so when I saw that they added them, I was ecstatic.

I check the shop, hoping to see the mask as a cosmetic for that day. Instead I leave with the pajama man. I now worship the pajama man, but that’s besides the point.

As I enter titan, I stumble across a storage type room about 3 rooms from the door. On one of the shelves I find a fancy mask. “Darn, it’s a scrap, not a cosmetic. I wonder if I can wear it?” 

To my glee, you can left click to hold the mask to your face. “I should scare someone when they enter” I though.

Twice more I put on the mask, but right before someone enters, I suddenly cannot remove the mask, and everything turns red. All they hear is my anguished cries before I go silent. I proceeded to kill my entire team, resulting in us losing the quota worth of scrap and one day to make it up.

This game is awful. 10/10 would do again.
One big thing to note about the masked enemies is that they will follow you outside the facility.
someone should make a decoy that looks like a player/scarecrow, that can be places to hold the coil head in space by looking at it
My friends and I discovered the masks organically. We brought a mask back to the ship as well as a crewmates body. When the mask makes contact with a corpse it automatically takes it over. We were very confused as to why our friend’s body just got up and started walking.
7:02 max speed is slightly less & you get the fear effect whenever it spots you
I love that players that have been bodyjacked by a shyguy still keep their friendly marker on the ship radar, so unaware cams players can try to 'rescue' them with the teleporter.
My god. I was just thinking that I wanted an enemy that hijacks your body. This dev knows what’s fun. 
I hope that masked teamates still appear friendly on the radar. I want mind games
Important thing about the mask: it can possess corpses. Always be wary of abandoning a corpse in Rend, you might see it walk out of the front door.
I find it funny how the aracnophobia mode was added because just yesterday I was teaching a young cousin about the game and he was handling the game pretty well, very scared all this considered, but when it got to the spiders he got absolutely terrified when he was walking back trying to find the way out and found spider webs, and I told him that was the bunker spider, and he asked me to pick the keyboard and play just for that bit so he could go back to the ship and continue playing after. I'd say the aracnophobia option will help him greatly lmao
I absolutely love love love that the power of the signal transmitter to keep the run alive is matched by it also just being another source of dread and terror.
 Imagine you are in the facility alone in the dark surrounded by monsters and you just see ""R U N"" or ""G O O D B Y E"" fill your entire vision.
 That is such a disheartening way to send bad news, it's perfect!

And Clash Royale just sneak peeked new tower troops. We analyzed frame by frame the ""tower"" projectile deals around 436 damage, has a 2.2 second attack speed and deals 198 dps. This is strong against Wizards and Tanks, but weak against swarm like bait and GY.

I can't wait for the day you can turn your king tower into an eagle artillery!
I can't wait to spend all of my family's savings on maxing out tower troops👍
To be honest, the new ""Cannon"" troop looks POWERFUL against tanks, but it's going to get annihilated by cycle, swarm, bait, GY decks. If it really has a 2.2 second attack speed, those are some FREE goblin barrels. It's probably gonna be costly to level up, but it doesn't seem ""advantageous"" to me. Just feels more Rock/Paper/Scissors if anything.
Can't wait to start hoarding troop cards to level up my Princess towers one level in every three years! I wonder what else fun they are going to do in future years, maybe make the King a card and make us pay even more.
Tower Troops seem like a really bad idea since this would counter win conditions at random and make matchmaking even more luck based. For example, if they add a splash damage tower troop, skeleton barrel perishes on the spot.
The warmth challenge is one of the most interesting challenge I've seen
Every card feels balanced around how much damage Spells, the Princess Towers and defensive buildings do to them. The moment any one of those aspects are changed heavily, the meta will definitely be torn from the ground up into something new.
Supershell never fails to disappoint ❤
I can't believe we gotta now pay to upgrade our towers 😂
What is supercell thinking?
I like how OJ deeply analyzes the Troop Tower video when he can justo wait for the oficial video in a few weeks. Algo great description of the warmth spell 😂
The warmth card/snowstorm is a brilliant idea! I've always felt like there should be something in each arena to make each of them unique (rain doesn’t count).
I just noticed that the warmth spell is able to heal Crown Towers.
Can’t wait to use this to chesse close match overtime .
Honestly OJ analysing the frames is actually really helpful
Warmth spells heal princess towers and probably king towers aswell, I also can't wait for evolved firecracker on the princess tower😊
Actually, Magic archer is quite op in this challenge because if your opponent keep stacking things you can use the 

POWER OF GEOMETRY
Introducing the warmth spell really makes me think that you can possible make a puzzle level with it; having already frozen troops on your and the opponents side. This would honestly only be possible if there were like an evolved mirror where I used the card on both sides😊

I think the attack speed getting reduced on Charlie was the icing on the cake because in reality none of the other nerfs mattered if she can still spam her main attack
The amount of effort you put in behind the scenes to get us the data is awesome and underrated
Honestly we really need an Olympics again. It would be cool to just see where every brawler is with all of the Olympics Kairos has made
The amount of joy I felt while hearing all the nerf to Charlie was like waking up to gift's under the Christmas tree  😸😸
SUBSCRIBE for Mico, Kit, & Larry sneak peeks!
5v5 looks insanely fun it's the mode I've been looking forward to the most
I noticed that when you were testing Lou’s super charge rate on the before side Lou had his epic (supercharge) gear equipped, I think this could have affected the outcome but idk.
Lets all thank Kairos for putting so much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peaks!!!

01:53 Edgar's hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed.

07:12 Buffs and nerfs to various brawlers
10:43 Brawl Stars update brings changes to game modes and introduces optional in-game ads.
12:32 Brawl pass system changes and updates
16:05 New system brings significant buffs for free-to-play players
17:34 Free-to-play players getting a 13.2% buff to coins
20:44 The new Brawl Pass offers more gems, free credits, and extra perks.
22:22 Brawl Pass Plus offers 96% more coins, 79% more power points, and exclusive perks.
25:35 Chroma credits will be converted to regular credits, affecting the cost of buying chromatic Brawlers
27:19 New skins showcase and details
30:56 New skins and animations for different brawlers
32:44 New skins and upgrades coming in the update
every time this man uploads i think of how much work he actually puts into this. The math and everything
32:54 It really looks like he's firing Power Points with his main attack. (and I also love the fact that Cil turned into a Starr Drop)
I love the direction this game has been going as a whole but as a long term player I hope down the road they make a prestige progression system with exclusive rewards down the road. I hope this game never dies. I always look forward to the brawl talks and podcasts. I’m so happy there only monthly seasons now!
I feel like Charlie  will never be under B or C tier, even after the nerfs, her super is still pretty easy to charge and the fact its a 5 second stun (since ppl rarely seem to help get their teammates out of the cocoon anyway) is still very good, her dps on long range will probably be almost the same, her attack is still pretty fast and easy to hit. but i do like the fact shes not a must pick anymore.
Love to see my favourite ever mobile game get such a good update, and such regular updates, they are always trying new things and adding stuff
Thanks for always making excellent and informative content ❤
I think the most oppressive part about Charlie was honestly her projectile speed. It is incredibly easy to land shots, and hard to dodge. And since she doesn't have normal ammo, this means she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down. Nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge... I do think her super should be straight up reworked, but that's a different topic. Nerfing the spiders and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though.
Kudos to Kairos for making this video
what a huge amount of content you have to cover!
I’m super excited for that mortis buff. Mortis has been and is still my favorite character in the game and this simply means that he’s going to be able to get that extra healing off 50% quicker which if he’s in a big bundle of enemies then he’s just gonna be able to heal that much quicker.
I do really appreciate how kairos does these videos and how he makes calculations for everyone so they can see how the value of their money translates. But when he talks on buying every brawl pass in the old system I feel we should consider even most paying players but every other pass with gems so his stats for that seem a little off to me personally.",20,Gaming,1050000,PT34M22S

If that doesn't work, then continue doing what you're doing
One thing I like about the prefab builds is they're modular; You can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with Shack Doors to create passible outbuildings.
Biggest building issue I've had is there doesn't seem to be a way to change the elevation of your non-prefab Foundations, making it hard to keep things at the same level.
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue, it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
You can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches , yes it costs more wood however it’ll light up the cave for you so it’s easier to find whatever your looking for
Before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating, not a tip
Don’t just throw away tools that you don’t use. Use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it. They can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation.
Really Fantastic Synopsis and Tips. You nailed it! I would add: 
-Build Your First Village at the Edge of a Desert Border AND Near a Knotwood cave, NOT where you spawn into the game. Make your life easier and everything more efficient!
-Build a Bed at the Mouth of a Cave as a Save Point. If you die, you respawn in your bed; you won't have to travel back to your quest point.
-Empty almost ALL of your Backpack before beginning a Quest. You'll need the inventory slots.
-Pack for a trip! MAX Wood Planks to build Repair Chests, Cooked Food, Snowberry Shakes or Cheesy Burgers
Its good to stack lumber mills, it makes crafting so much quicker
something I always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever I need to collect granite I take that villager and start going at some rocks. unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes, even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching, so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
If you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and it’ll destroy everything for you
Go on top of moutains that have large trees, cut them down, roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
I love to make a village stylish and neat, it is the most important thing! 😊
Man, this was one of the coolest surprises of the year.  I've always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome.  Who'd have thought it would be fortnite to do it
You’re lucky - the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and that’s with infinite stamina.  However, the cold biome is 2 steps away
Make glider , build staircases 11 high. Make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as I land I build another one so I can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol I even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so I know the direction they follow back to back , helps tons on the map
Stamina bar is important, when youre flying with a glider, it consumes your stamina while up in the air, by the time you run out, you will drop from fall damage and die.
I personally think temp don’t matter as much,but stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didn't go down, so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills, lumber mills, work benches, etc. then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
The way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me. That way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells. And the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S

Unlike most of your covered incidents, this seemed much less a Swiss cheese model and much more a tragic plethora of challenges and confusion happening all at once. So sad, since the crew had been so professional and cautious.
I've been an airline captain for 37 consecutive years. Have in excess of 27,000 hrs PIC, on 777, 767, 737, A320, 727 and ATR. 
I'm still learning, been lucky on my career so far, without any serious trouble to date.
I must say this channel's content is the most precious ever, it's a valuable learning tool. 
My sincere compliments to Mentour Pilot!
I live in Rostov-on-Don and this tragedy really shocked all of us. And unfortunately someone I know were affected and lost the members of their families. I’ve read a lot of investigations and different articles about this catastrophe, but only here and now I really understood what happened. Thank you for this video and explanation. And may all the crash victims rest in peace 🙏
I’m an air traffic controller and we use your videos extensively during ECT, not only to provide better assistance during time of need, but also to learn valuable lessons that could potentially help us in the future. Never too old or experienced to learn and your videos serve as excellent library of information. Thank you for the amazing content!
The copilot was a friend of my brother and I from years before the tragedy. We knew him quite well from those years. He was smart, and thorough. I investigated all that I could of how and what happened, and I saw he tried to save this situation as much as possible, but the captain was tremendously confused and deep in tunnel vision to back off his decisions and start trusting instruments in time. Very very sad. RIP Alex
I’ve been a pilot for 17 years here in Germany. Not only is this channel informative, it also serves as a valuable learning tool for pilots all across the globe. The simulator is a fantastic learning device, but most accidents I feel can be attributed to overload stress and crew resource management. Basic communication between crew members is absolutely essential. If something is wrong, mention it. And a good Captain uses his resources and listens. Inexperience does not always equal a wrong answer. 

Thank you for your videos. They are second to none and a vital resource for any current or future pilot! You may be saving future lives with your informative videos!
I remember watching your videos when you were on the sofa with the notes and the dogs. There was nothing wrong with that and I still love your old video, but it's so amazing to see how you've grown the channel into making TV quality documentaries at this point. You're an inspiration Petter!
I can only imagine how fast the final 59 seconds must have occurred in that cockpit. Also, to be in the back of the plane at that time of morning, after waiting and waiting and waiting, the horror that some of the alert passengers must have realized was about to happen. I can only pray that the impact was so sudden, so severe and so instant that nobody had any chance to feel that for even a second. Wonderful job here, as always, describing the events as true to life as possibly. Thank you!

I was not really prepared for this to end in such a tragic crash. It seemed like such a simple issue, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. This is one of the accidents that are so sad because it seemed so preventable. My condolences to all who lost their loved ones.
As a frequent flyer, i treasure these insights into how safe aviation travel is.  Flying is complicated, and yet flying is still the safest mode of transportation.  Channels like yours showcase what can go wrong, but highlight what prevents these accidents from happening in the first place.
Great job Petter, describing a sad accident that simply should NOT have happened.
(I’m a retired 30k hour captain, with lots of time on both the 737-800 with it’s fabulous HUD, and other Boeings up to and including the 747-400.)
It was a really sad, very disturbing story, showing how absolutely critical it is to stay ahead of the aeroplane. 
I wonder why he was so loathe to use Autopilot in such conditions.
The quality of the explanation at 33:16 (behind/ahead of the aircraft) is just insane. Thank you Mentour for letting us enjoy your lectures.
My friend live in a building bordering the airport. 
When plane smashed into the ground, the whole building was shaken, and few windows got broken. 
Some small fragments of the aircraft were scattered across his and some nearby buildings' roofs. 

That should give you a rough idea of the forces involved.
As a young engineer that only just started her career in aviation, I must thank you and your team for your hard work explaining each and every incident. You cannot imagine how your content not only helps pilots but also other people who work in aviation.
Thanks to your content, I’ve understood things more in depth and it brought a new meaning to my job as an aeronautics engineer and how much every detail can make a change.

Keep up the good work! ❤
The Fltcrew were well trained, and performed well until the 2nd approach. This terrible accident brings many things into question, including if we're reaching the limits of the man/machine interface as it currently exist. 
Pieter, your content and presentation is absolutely amazing. 
I felt this one in my bones.
RIP to all aboard.
These episodes now blow any sort of Nat Geo type air incident documentaries, with all their overly dramatic 'entertainment' elements out of the water.
Massive thanks to you Petter, and all of your superb team - so well explained, presented and executed.
Patreon membership here I come 👍🙂
Albert Einstein said, if you can’t explain it to a six year old you don’t understand it yourself. I am not 6 years old but when it comes to aviation I may as well be. After watching your videos I can give a reasonable explanation as to what happened in the event you reviewed. Proud to be part of you patron crew. Keep the videos coming.
Oh wow... throughout almost the entire video, right up until you told us that the GPWS warnings were too late, I had been thinking that this was going to be one of those ""near miss"" incidents, where they went through some terrifying loss of control, but were able to pull through in the end.  I hadn't ever heard of this accident before, and figured that if it had ended in a fatal crash, I'd have known about it already.  That ending was such a gut punch.  Just shows how quickly things can change in the cockpit.",24,Entertainment,1690000,PT51M33S

epic fortnite chapter 5 season OG moments 

USE CODE CREAMY IN THE FORTNITE ITEM SHOP",1569,"If they update regularly this game is gunna be nuts.
I like the new Fortnite Lego game mode it’s something new and fresh.
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest. It's way better than we all expected
One can only imagine how they're going to continue developing the mode, it has so much potential, i cant wait to see where we go from here, personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
Also, I found out, if you’re behind a bush while killing the boss dude, he won’t attack you, he gets confused. Also, another glitch, if you put down a new chest and put your swords, farming tools, etc in it, and punch it to break it, it heals your weapons and farming tools (note this will be patched asap I’m sure). But it works for now!
I hope you enjoyed the new mode, it's been a ton of fun for me and the boys :)
I think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby. As a person who experienced that myself, today was my first time playing Chapter 5. I absolutely loved Battle Royale but I clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in LEGO
I had some experience with Motion Capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall. Kudos to the devs. It's a funny detail you wouldn't neccessary expect in a game like this one. Ps. You almost saw me as Leon in these new Resident Evil games :)
So far, this mode is pretty similar to minecraft, if they update regularly, this can become an original masterpiece.
Keep it up Creamy! The new mode is really fun tho.🔥
You know it’s a good day when McCreamy uploads
I've been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff, but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative!! I'm so excited for this game mode. There's so many possibilities!
McCreamy is a legend. Bro makes a boring day into a good one, love this guy. ❤
I think that this is the best day that they’ve had in a while. Amazing job Fortnite! 🎉❤
McCreamy never fails to make good content 😅 😱
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 💖💖💖
I love how he steps out of his way just to entertain us
you can tell this mode is gonna be succesfull and i trust epic games in keeping it updated and interesting
The fact that McCreamy does this for OUR entertainment is just gold. We all love you McCreamy! 😅 😅",20,Gaming,10500000,PT19M40S

I was rooting for Greg the whole time 😂
Is anyone else so happy Greg won!!
I rooted for Greg because he seemed so sweet and wholesome, he even got a presend for his granddaughter, and when Chris tossed the gift, he said ""hey dont do that 😞"" HES SO SWEET
Can we just take this moment and appreciate how much work he puts in his videos love the vids also
I love Preston’s videos! He puts a lot of effort into them and makes them enjoyable! ❤
I’m only at 12:14 right now but rooting so hard for Greg and Scott!
Preston, this video was awesome! I love the idea of having a secret room in public. You can hide away so that no one will see you. Preston, if you were to purchase a shopping chart, I think it will cost approximately around $10,000 or so because it’s expensive and belongs to the store. I love watching your fun challenge videos because you come up with crazy ideas. Next video, can you try to build a secret house in your house, please Preston? Anyways, I am a huge fan of your videos! ❤🎉
Imagine Greg telling his children about this day😂
5:00 Seeing Scott cracking up made my day.
I'm so glad Greg and Scott won. Such a great team. He deserved it.
Preston is the only guy to do this and not clickbait us. Major respect. ❤
I love Preston’s videos! He puts a lot of effort into them and makes them enjoyable!
entertaining as always Preston never ceases to amaze us!

#Liverpool #LFC",2893,"Endo couldn’t have been more clinical, the way he places that shot is just beautiful. Trent was outstanding once again.
Endo has been contributing with every match he plays. Hope he continues to make his presence felt in that Liverpool midfield.
I think Wataru Endo's goal boosted the team's motivation and brought the last goal to win.
All long distance goals from Liverpool. What a team!
Aside from the phenomenal strikes, this game was amazing because our midfield showed they can get the goals even when the forwards aren’t scoring. Adds a dynamic we’ve lacked for years.
Unforgettable Match..☺️☺️
Really missed Allison 😔
Which goal was best? Comment below...
Many Liverpool fans didn't expect Endo to score, but if you knew him in Stuttgart, you knew it was a situation where he excelled!
Can’t remember the last Liverpool game with 4 goals and not one attacker on the score sheet  😅 Mind blowing… those goals were all just simply amazing
Can't get to choose My Favourite, that stunning freekick full of confidence to Open The Game, the world class strike from Macca to put us ahead once again, that clinical finish from Endo to get us back in The Game, just 4mins after he came in from the bench, or the glorious finisher/winner from trent 90secs later. What a Game. Blessed to be a Liverpool fan.
What the goal from Endo!!! As a Japanese, I’m glad that he is getting used to his new task here and contributing to the team with this amazing goal.
Trent,Mac allister,Endo, unbelievable goals 💥💥💥
Gakpo and Endo change the GAME. Really change the game ❤
What a goal by Alexis Mac Alistair🇦🇷💙
Endo actually turned the game around at the last few minutes 🔥
Endo's goal was the much needed strike to turn things around for us. This team is just incredible!!!!
Goal of the season by Alexis Mac Allister❤😮

#miamaples #dior #expensive",4430,"the fact that the dior advent calendar is more expensive than buying everything individually at retail price👀
PETITION FOR MIA TO TURN THE DIOR BOX INTO A DOLL HOUSE!!!!
I love that Dior is so aware that their $5,400 is ridiculous that they actually pay someone to call you up and ask ""Are you sure?"" 💀
The Disney Swarovski set was underwhelming given how many characters Disney owns
Charlotte tillbury one was the only one that's worth it. it provided all the basics that you need for makeup(besides foundation and concealer and stuff that you need to pick individually for your skin complexion) so if someone wants to get into Charlotte tillbury or just high end makeup, this will be a perfect thing to buy. props to them!!!
Only Mama Maples can make the best out of the worst situation of being scammed but a luxury company.
In my limited experience, the more expensive the calendar, the higher the disappointment. Can't go wrong with a cheap one, it's only up from there! ♥
I got progressively angrier at Dior the farther we went. Even if they did retail that much, they’re a scam. And they don’t even retail. It’s disgusting.
I'm a retired nurse , and in my life would never be able to afford  to indulge in even one of these products  Saying that,  I really enjoyed seeing you and your mom unbox these calendars.  Thank you for the opportunity to experience this with you.. This is the first video I''ve watched of yours and subscribed immediately!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!😍
Has Mama Maples EVER not been a ray of absolute sunshine?   I cannot imagine her mad,
I don't know, maybe the cost was making you guys giddy, but I CACKLED so hard during the Dior unboxing! Thanks for the laugh! ❤
Am I the only one hearing that they are saying SwarVoski? And she also spelled it that way on the ""screen"" where she announces the different advent calendars. I think that's so funny 😅 love the energy
Also the fact that Mama Maples tries to educate Mia on all the Disney characters is sooo funny 😂
Watching Mia's advent calendar videos is now one of my Christmas traditions lol, I get stunned by the prices every year.
Mia, I'm sorry that Dior is so extra. However, these are the MOST fun videos! I look forward to them every year! I love momma Maples reactions. She's so priceless! Thank you!!
19:13 the moment Mia goes to stop Mama Maples from trying the lipstick 😂 she is so cute!
Both of those went totally in a different direction than I expected! I thought Disney would be a new character every box, and I have no idea why Dior I assumed makeup. This was a wild ride 😂
I love when your Mom gets excited about opening the boxes. The ""wows"" all made me laugh.
I love how her mom is excited for everything 😂🧡
I feel like these videos are 100 times funnier because of mama Maples haha. I’ll strive to be a mom like her some day ❤

http://share.epidemicsound.com/pHDFT",5831,"I’ve never seen someone buy so many items at a Japanese electronic store. You must have broken a record 😂
Thanks for having me along for the day man, was a lot of fun!
Hope you’ve got some snacks ready - this is the longest video we’ve EVER made 😂 Which country’s tech do you want us to test next?
Looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in Japan! Next time round, how about scoping out some everyday gizmos. Would love to see how Japan's home-tech game stacks up against ours.
your one of my favorite YouTubers Arun. you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
Fun Fact, there was actually another company in Japan called ""Logitec"" (it's spelled the same as Logitech in Japanese), and they were in Japan before Logitech was able to open up anything in Japan, so they had to change their name to Logicool in Japan only to avoid a name conflict.
This is so surreal. I've been letting the Abroad in Japan channel build up videos to binge, and after the Frozen Frontier series, I went back to another video from Arun to finish it, and I was like ""Oh yeah! There's a new video, I wanna watch that!"" And now seeing Chris walk in was like...

The only way I can express the feeling was imagine you watch a TV show, and then switch to another TV show, only to see the character from the other TV show nonchalantly walk in. Like, what?
That trackball mouse is something I used at my job back in the late 80s, early 90s. You’ve never seen one before?! 
This was a great collab!  Love to watch both yours and Chris’s channels. 
That store completely blows my mind. I could be in there for days…
Love the longer video, btw. This was enjoyable to watch.
I might be one of the few Japanese subscribers of your channel. Your videos are awesome and I genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them (maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho). Hope you’ll come back soon🇯🇵🙌
I think I can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food, genuinely amazing.
the timing of those memes is just *chef's kiss*
I love how excited Arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol.
The ball mouse is called a trackball, pretty useful especially helping reduce RSI. its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it. Also for fine control, you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate.
39:20 first time in Japan (over twenty years ago) taught me that rice is not a ""bulk up"" / ""filler""  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate, even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion - it's a hard sell to a lot of Westerners   
but  it's my occasional, once or twice a year, life mission.
I’m a Japanese in the UK and I really enjoyed this.  Shame the kids watch won’t work in the UK. With child safety more of an issue here than in Japan it would probably do relatively well here.  I love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years.  Yum Asia do good ones in the UK and not as expensive as the Japanese leader but similar technology. I didn’t see it in the video, and I know it’s not a cooking channel… but I hope you washed the rice first…. 😅
It’s my dream to go to Japan, definitely visiting this tech place when I eventually go 🥰
Touch Ball Mice are used a lot in North America (Canada more then USA) they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as AutoCAD Maya, Blender and image creation such as Krita, Photoshop etc. They work very well for a lot of things even gaming. I loved mine but the ball has a small accident, exactly like the one you had when you picked it up, My sister and I nicked named the ball  ""BOOOTS"" its a joke from Baldur's Gate 2 with the Gigantic Minatare Space Hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling ""NO BOOTS!"" as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over, its done and now you are sad. I would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice, with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion, when it fits right, you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life. So you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how ""BOOTS"" died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident. After that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality. 
Final thing there are some that use 2-4 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3D environment such as 123D, AutoCAD and others, but it also makes games such as MMORPGs, FPS and RTS a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots, especially the multiple sensor ones.

So find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the DPI you want and never look back, that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that, a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments.
I love coverage like this. I'd love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device. For example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s (a portable record player was one of my first repairs). I'd be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then. I suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts, or vinyl enthusiasts, but instead retirees, whose entire music collection is in vinyl, and are just happy to still be able to play what they have.

I felt this way about a few of the items in this video, and some recent videos. I think it's especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices.

Other than that, you've done an amazing job, as always. And I can't wait to see the next one.
Thank you so much for giving us so much quality content and being so interesting❤ you look like you had a fun time🎉
This is a dream collab! For a long time I watched you guys' channels and appreciated you in every video, but seeing you conquer the biggest electronic store together is such a nice surprise. Japan lifestyle carries both futuristic prospects and the relics of the past, so any kind of video from there is bound to be the most interesting tech and lifestyle content.
Arun consistently amazes me with the incredible dedication and effort he puts into his videos. His passion for technology shines through in every frame, and it's truly commendable. The buying and reviewing tech series is, without a doubt, the best out there – his thorough insights, engaging delivery, and genuine excitement for the latest gadgets make each video an absolute delight to watch. Keep up the fantastic work, Arun, your hard work does not go unnoticed, and your content continues to be a beacon for tech enthusiasts like myself!",28,Science & Technology,17300000,PT40M10S

Sorry for the confusion, i made the list for myself,added the games i interested with. Btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event, you can look for them
The orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of Oscar’s. The Flute Guy especially man, he absolutely nailed it.
I loved hearing the Alan Wake director speak on both occassions, he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching.
1:29:15 Loved Geoff Keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the Hello Kitty game! Best moment for me.
Let's all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there, what a legend
Congratulations Larian, you absolutely deserve all these awards and more!🎉😊
Congratulations to every other winner/nominee as well.

In all honesty BG3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo, but I'm happy TOTK, FF16, Alan Wake 2 and Hi-Fi Rush won some awards as well. Would have been perfect if Lies of P won best art direction.
Sami Järvi (a.k.a. Sam Lake) just IS Remedy Entertainment!!
This guy is living his job. 
Performing the choriography with Poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make.
Remedy pretty much never dissappoints.
Cheers!
Flute Guy is the pillar of The Game Awards that absolutely everyone can get behind. We may all like different games, but our celebration of Flute Guy is unanimous.
Huge congratulations to Neil Newbon and all the other Baldur's gate 3 makers. You have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves!!
A game dev that is so committed to his game that he goes to an awards show in a suit of FREAKING ARMOUR kinda deserves the win, huh. Keep making games, Larian!

#animation",1546,"Something the character and the actor have in common... We both suck at basic math! Hahaha. Loved these bits. Hope everyone else enjoys and will enjoy the last of what we made of Sheriff Hayseed.
This style of Todd is pretty neat
I love that clever detail where Shawn has to lick his hoof in order to grab the card and pick it up. 😄
Todd popping his brain out over figuring out the basic math on the playing cards is absolutely mind-blowing.
It’s a shame this could never be completed, but regardless, this was wonderful!
Very cool animation as always, hope that arm is feeling better
I dunno why, but Todd tapping the table (0:35) while trying to understand the game is weirdly adorable.
Piemations needs his own movie
Hope you will recover from your wrist pain. Amazing animation as always!
This would’ve looked like such an amazing show if it came to be!
Gee, I'm gonna miss this show, but putting your health first is something that we should all value. The sake of entertainment isn't cheap. Thank you for creating such an awesome piece of animation.
So this is the canonical ending. Todd tries to do basic maths and dies.

I salute you, Sheriff Hayseed. You were fun whilst you lasted
Super unique and stylized! Shame Hayseed isn't gonna be finished :(
For one side i get why It got canceled, the artstyle is amazing and way too high effort for a small team to pull It out with out massive crutch... But in the other side i would love seeing this getting a Full budget and becoming yet another great YouTube Indie animated series
I'll miss this guy. Hope your arm gets better eventually
Love it, Pie! I really dig the new style! I know it's been hard to animate with the pain in your wrists lately, but you still did an awesome job with this! Kudos and looking forward to any new material you may put out going forward!! 👍
It's really unfortunate that this got cancelled, I love the animation and the style change looks really nice
It's a shame the show is going on indeterminate hiatus, I really like these two's chemistry.
I absolutely love how Todd's fangs are consistently drawn into every frame. I'm so used to people only drawing the fangs during times of aggression that's its nice for them to just _be there_ naturally.
We haven’t seen these awesome characters since 2020. What a great return!",23,Comedy,4140000,PT52S

Can't wait to see 20+mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
Shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh.
Really happy to see where smosh is currently.
I almost teared up when Anthony at the end says that Shayne has kept the true meaning of Smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera. It's so true and that's what makes Smosh so special. Especially the cast now. You can see how close everyone is with each other and from Ian and Anthony to Chance and Angela. (the newest cast members) Everyone just puts a big smile on my face!
come back next week for a new *Assumptions episode with OPENLY GAY PASTORS*
MEMBERS WATCH UNCENSORED & AD FREE▸ https://youtube.com/anthonypadilla/join
Man, at the beginning, when Anthony started listing all the eras Shayne went through, I got so sad. These people carried Smosh through it's darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old Smosh. Shayne, Courtney, Damien etc. truly are the unsung heroes of Smosh.
I’ll basically watch Shayne do anything for any amount of time.
I love this era of smosh. Smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter. We're now honoring Smosh for everything they've done. and seeing how they've become a giant family warms my heart. What a time to be alive.
Shayne’s depth as a human is what made me enjoy Smosh more… I remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is. As someone else who LOVES reading and thinks it, more than anything else, can develop a person, that was nice to see :) he’s genuine, intelligent, and over the top absurd. Love him!
Dearest Shayne, I can’t tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on Smosh this entire time. We don’t know what we would ever do without you. You are not only hilarious, but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member. I see how invested you are in other people. We all love you and please keep doing what you’re doing.
Ian and Anthony are the parents of Main but Pit and Games are Shayne’s babies. He really carried those channels for so long, my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic. Woo Shayne, Shayne it up!
I actually really like the idea of interviewing Smosh cast members.
Shayne is just such a pleasant person, he seems so fun and nice to be around. Love seeing Anthony and Shayne together again. The ""We Bought Smosh"" arc really is the best timeline.
The way Shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how I know he has the brain of an artist
Him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome ... deserves the world honestly
I’m glad that Shayne is getting some flowers. He’s clearly a comedy powerhouse, and very hardworking and loyal, but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person. I’m sure success will find him whatever he gets up to, but I’m glad it’s Smosh right now :)
I respect everything that Shane has done (as he is my favorite cast member), he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to Smosh & has helped kept it alive alongside Courtney & Ian.
Not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but I feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way.
I'm gonna be honest, the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of Shayne. I find him the MOST funny, comforting, relatable and inspiring personality on the internet. LOVE YOU SHAYNE
I don’t know if Shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry. Like… I remember that scene of the office when Jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives. And we can see all that with Shayne, Anthony, and the rest of the Smosh crew. They’re all incredible people and it’s awesome to see how far they have all grown.
The Chosen and Courtney Freaking Miller are two absolutely amazing characters, and I get so excited every time I see them on screen ❤",27,Education,7580000,PT31M26S

Huge props to the editors, they are insane
If Jimmy had his own National Geographic series, it would be insane 🔥
mr beast side missions getting out of hand 😆
Jimmy being constantly confused on why people are letting him do things is hilarious.
This man has literally done everything possible
amo os vídeos do mr. beast e acompanho ele a anos, fiquei super feliz quando começaram a dublar os vídeos, foi uma coisa incrível pq deu pra perceber como a voz encaixou perfeitamente nele, porém, com essa troca repentina de dublador, foi como se os vídeos tivessem perdido a cor, e ele a sua personalidade. Não conseguiu agradar em nada, e acredito que muitas pessoas do público brasileiro do mr. beast também pensam assim.

Então trazer a voz antiga dele e a melhor decisão para ambos os lados, e respeito ao público brasileiro também.
How does jimmy never run out of ideas love it!
Sir is an absolute legend props to you and your team!

Thanks to all of our Gold Level Patrons! Marisa Alfonso, Wendy Tran, Traci Lew, Matthew Tadros",2594,"Marissa and Zach have the energy of two siblings determined to ruin each other's days
The guys have come so far since the very first WAR episodes.

Proud to say I have survived another season.

Still one of my all time favorite shows to film ❤
You should have a flipped season where all the experts have to try to remake all the dumb shit the Guys have invented but actually good
I still want a reverse WAR where they challenge 4 experts to make something without a recipe and the Try Guys judge them
One of the things that I think is really impressive about Keith is that he's able to see when he's messed something up really badly, toss it out, and then make something to fill the gap that isn't perfect but works. He might not be the BEST cook but he's got some genuine skill that just needs a recipe.
I love the judges' reactions when Keith brought out his smores- Noelle was concerned but hopeful, whilst Jonny & Rosanna were like 'oh god not again' 😂
this is the first WAR where I vehemently disagree with the judges. Zach should NOT have come in 4th place over Marissa, whose marshmallow literally almost made a judge vomit. out of all of the s'mores, I wanted to try Zach's the most. I am happy that Eugene won, tho. those tartlets looked so pretty! 😍
Johnny was FIGHTING for all of the creations to be considered s’mores 😂 that Keith mouth comparison had me dying 😂
im absolutely living for eugene's fancy 'mellows
""We clearly forget the rubric. We have a rubric and we just say f*ck the rubric!"" That line took me OUT 😂😂 I love Zach lol
I don't know why but when Johnny said ""mama this is a smore."" Made me smile because it reminds me of all the failed and ugly attempts I've had at making something and my aunts or older cousins would be like ""mama this is good. You did good.""
Keith and Eugene bring fun and wholesome energy. Marissa and Zach bring low key competitive siblings who are grasping at straws to finish the assignment
Something about her sweet tone of voice gives Rosanna the same energy as a kindergarten teacher trying to use gentle parenting techniques on a student who just brought a dead squirrel off the road for show and tell.
Only 10 seconds in and Eugene WILLINGLY going in for a hug from Keith - initiating it! - has sent me to another plane of existence.  So happy!
Eugene just happily and casually hugging Keith and Keith being surprised is just so wholesome considering Eugene doesn't like being hugged 🥹🥹🥹
Eugene, the one who made Ro throw up, comforting Melissa, the one who almost made Ro throw up, is so funny 😂
Eugene helping Keith this time? How the tables have turned.

The hugs and kisses from Eugene at the beginning were so cute too 🥺

I like how they reacted more to the Artisan S'more Shop owner than any of the multi-Michelin star chefs they've invited before.

Salió de su casa con la mente encendida
Hoy discutió con el otro, me la dejó servida
Ya llama de una para recogerla
Plan B en la radio canta con sus nenas
Unos shots de clase azul y vamos directo al club
por qué ella solo quiere eh

Me gusta que me den como es
Toa’ la noche Bellakeo
Todo mundo quiere acercarse a mi
Pero yo no quiero a nadie
Es que cuando tu lo mueves así
El ambiente se pone peligroso
Pa’ hacer fresquerias
Papi tu tas duro, ya tu lo sabías
Tu eres mucho más de lo que pedía
Quien diria que esta noche pasaría 
Y no requiere el aval de nadie
Ella dice eh eh eh

Otro éxito, Anitta puede seguir cantando sólo reggaetón, porque cuando canta música en portugués, los brasileños no valoran su interpretación. Annita es la artista más grande que ha tenido Brasil.
Es un orgullo ser mexicano 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 y más por ser un paisano de Guadalajara y aún más por ser el # 1 y eso vale pero vale mucho para todos los mexicanos y arriba mexics!

Eu vejo essa mulher trabalhando tanto pra mostrar sua música e o funk pro mundo, que sinto na obrigação de sempre apoiar ela em tudo.
Vou sempre apoiar a Anitta no espanhol, e principalmente no reggeton, a voz dela combina mt com esse idioma.

From Bethesda and Arkane Lyon, the studio that brought you Dishonored and “DEATHLOOP”, Marvel’s Blade is a mature, single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris, now in development in collaboration with Marvel Games.

If Blade turns out to be as good as Dishonored 2, it will be a memorable experience. Being 100% single-player is a great start.
I could’ve shed a tear when they said it’ll be a third-person single player game.

Thank you Arkane Lyon!
Getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most Blade thing ever
SO glad that a gameplay-focused studio like Arkane is doing Blade, some of the most fluid Gun/Sword gameplay in the Biz.
Perfect mix of character, studio and platform!
Can't wait to see more of this!
Finally!!!!! One of my favorite characters gets his own game. I love the dark, ominous feel that this has. 3rd person single player too? Yes please.
Ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it. I just get excited that someone is making blade.
Loving the art style already. This is definitely going to be visually stunning
Love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop. It gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires.
Esto será un gran juego, gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
THIS!!! A BLADE Game is a FANTASTIC idea. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾This has so much potential the artstyle, colour and lighting is astonishing. The character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and Blade looks like he came straight off the pages. 

And the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed, the elements of Dishonoured and Deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit Blades combat and abilities. Out of the upcoming marvel games this is my Favourite.
Glad to see Blade gets a new game. Hopefully they will do the character justice. Fingers crossed.
The fact that we’re getting the game before the movie is bizarre but I’m so excited I can’t wait for it. This looks so dope.
Esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais, bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos!!!
Vou voltar aqui todos os dias para apreciar essa obra de arte
Muito interessante,aparentemente sera uma animação linda
Se imaginan ahora un universo de videojuegos de marvel. Esto sin duda sera mejor q el cine ya que es algo que podemos vivir en carne propia sino q tendra total libertad creativa a la hora de tratar a los personajes y mas profundidad

#TomPetty #LoveIsALongRoad #GTA6",2794,"Tom Petty got a whole new generation of fans, Rockstar always has good taste
It hit so hard when I heard the first few notes in the trailer. RIP Legend

Soon, we’ll be back in Vice City brothers
This song is going to be stuck in my head for the next 10-15 years. Thanks Rockstar and especially thanks to Tom Petty for having produced such a master piece! Rest well!
This song will be remembered for a long time, a perfect Rockstar Games choice.
RIP Tom. A whole new generation of fans over a 90 second trailer. You will live forever.
80s music will truly never die
Love that a younger generation is discovering a true American Icon. RIP Tom, you’re a legend.
Why does older music always hit 10x's harder than modern music? This is so good, and I feel so stupid for sleeping on this masterpiece for all these years.
Been a huge Tom Petty fan for decades and I can only applaud a new generation of fans coming in. Truly timeless rock music!
The fact that this song is finally getting the respect it’s always had but from a younger generation eases my heart! Can’t wait to hear the playlists they got lined up! I’m 42 years old! I’ve loved this song since I first heard it in late 80’s headed into the 90’s Tom Petty was born 10 years late and for great measure! Now as an older man, who just hopes he can play the next gta! Not sure if I’ll make it to 7, but I’m hoping I can make it rdr3! But hey that’s the rockstar life! Cheers to Tom Petty the coolest rockstar there ever was! Dude quit touring and was like, time to OD! Gangster! RIP!
This music is going to be stuck in my head until 2025... A such masterpiece
One thing Rockstar never disappoints us with is good taste for music
Tom would be so blown away and appreciative of the new love this track is getting. The entire album is a banger and worth checking out.
This is actually one of the best albums ever made. Welcome new fans. :)
We miss you so much Tom. Thank you for the glorious wealth of real music you left us.❤❤🎉
essa musica vai entrar para historia
Esse cantor ja se tornou uma lenda e vai ser lembrado sempre... Se ele estivesse vivo estaria pulando de felicidade por ver sua música fazendo muito sucesso.
La primera vez que escuchó una canción de este cantante y la verdad me encanto,soy muy fans de las canciones de los 80,y esta canción encaja perfectamente en mis gustos
Essa e uma das melhores músicas que ja vi em um trailer
Rockstar sempre acerta nas músicas, incrível",10,Music,116000,PT4M7S

Lyrics:
I was missin in action like Chrisean tooth Back letting loose like a nigga had to point Imma god in Memphis who bigger than me The shit that they did I did at 16
He flexing his money we know that he broke Dick in her mouth NLE throat coat
He pressed bout a girl that’s fucking the city He tender we call him diddy
Choppa so big knock the weight off biggie I’m some like pussy this shit a get sticky Got me in that mode ion plan on glitching I’m back, nigga like I had an addiction
Dropped him Lego
He couldn’t take those Switches and dracos Shooters on payroll
Nigga don’t won’t no smoke they snoop dog We show up to yo door like uhaul
Lil nigga with a pistol stand tall
Quick to pop a nigga ass like a Adderall
Shaking the spot like a ass or some
Lil bruh sped he crash for none
Walk out the house with a mask and gun Better hold yo breath like a asthma pump
I move like the pope
100 some shots inna ghost
Better think twice don’t approach No regular Glocks
Know that it came with a box
We stepping like shoes and socks
One of the realest how can you not mention we slid out a civic now rolls Royce whippin She sucking and spitting double jerking twisting killing my kids like abortion clinics
Take some from who he line man
Nigga don’t feel like dying man
Cook em like grease in a frying pan
We don kilt mo niggas then the klansman
Kkk got ks on ks wanna fuck Kim k and make Kanye watch
Aye bay bay in the club with a drake gen 5 Glock Going down like joc
100 shots inna whip it was shot o’clock
He can run from Nigga but not from this Glock Don’t ask me if it’s one up top
That’s like asking Floyd Mayweather do he box
Walk down on his cat
9 lives he cap
Put his head in his lap we dicked em
Make the choppa clap
Make it sound like a rapper Imma hit this bitch with a rhyme
My dog sick em
Condition critical
Suspect nigga weon never been a victim 7.62 trip em
If I don’t got em tevo a get em
I might just O fuck that percs killing Slow fuck that, if I see his hoe Fuck That, last shotta flow fuck that

The simple fact Jay even watched The Flash is astonishing.
Jay is jealous of how many cats Mike Flanigan is able to kill compared to him.
I believe Wes Anderson could make a very, very unsettling surreal horror movie.
""I just wanted to see babies falling out of skyscrapers"" - Jay Bauman, 2023.
Timestamps:
0:00 Beginning
39:21 End
Jay’s genuine “no…” when asked if he’d want a fake dead cat was so adorable 35:08 esp since he had two alive cats
Jay is steadily draining the life of Mike and Rich in his quest for everlasting youth.
Even when Jay “doesn’t remember a thing” about a movie he still remembers more than Mike.
The Killer is actually based on an indie comic by luc jacamon from the mid 00s.  I realized as Jay was walking through that narrative description and its crazy to think that comic actually got an adaptation so many years later, I remember stumbling across an animated version of the first issue years ago on a site called FlashTV and grabbing the first collected book of it a year or two later.  If indie comics from that era are finally getting their turn for film/series adaptations then hopefully some of my favorites will get some attention, like the Warren Ellis series Global Frequency.
Yes Jay, they did get Michael Shannon for The Flash, and he publicly admitted it was a bullshit role in the nicest way possible by saying it wasn't very satisfying and likening it to being an action figure as opposed to a character.
We need another show where Jay talks to his cat about the latest sex-pervert films
I love Judy Greer being in everything . Her face and voice are instantly recognizable. so regardless of the character she plays, she feels like a reoccurring character that travels from movie to movie .
Mike asking Jay if he wants one of the dead prop cats was actually just him trying to fish for Christmas gift ideas
People talk about Paul Rudd looking good for his age but he's got nothing on Barbara Crampton. 64 years young and still an absolute knockout.
""But then, do they fight ZOD in the middle of the desert for 45 minutes?"" should be a standard question when reviewing great movies.
I'm happy to see Jay liked The Killer. Some viewers complained about the movie feeling like an empty technical exercise. But the sly sense of humor where it's constantly poking fun at the assassin and poking holes in his neurotic precision and need for control was the extra layer that made the movie work for me.
This has to be the most positive half in the bag episode ever
I like that George Lucas in THE PHANTOM MENACE pioneered the technology to be able to split actors from different takes and composite them together, so that decades later Mike could wag his finger at a zombified Jay
Sanctuary is the most brilliant adaptation of Mike and Rich's relationship that I have ever seen.",24,Entertainment,1510000,PT39M21S

Congratulations!! 🙌🏻
🍼 Congrats Lauren, Bobby, Melody and Dexter!
🍼 congratulations! So happy for you all. Sorry you’ve had some dodgy things go on with social media making you worried, some people can be scary. Looking forward to the fun baby content 😊
i’ve watched for you years and it’s insane how everything has changed. it’s a good change. you’re doing great lauren! congratulations 🍼
seeing my childhood youtubers live their lives is a fantastic thing. SO HAPPY FOR YOU
CONGRATS!!! As another 31 year old toddler mom I have loved watching your content especially on my hard busy days. You make me laugh and ease my day which as you know us moms need sooooooo much 🍼🐥
I'm sorry to hear things have been rough for you, Lauren, and congrats on the new baby! seeing Melody playing around was so cute, she seemed so energetic. Just take your time to get things together and do things at a steady pace, no rush ^^
Congratulations! So excited for you. I am praying for a great future for you all. Take it slow, and get lots of sleep. 🎉
So glad to hear about the news and glad you found your area! Stay healthy, stay the galaxy-deer queen you are, Lauren, best wishes! 🍼
congratulations! 🍼 take your time with the kiddos, its a big life step and we all understand the stress that is bringing you. people are sucky and totally understand how apathetic the internet has become. been watching your content for quite a few years now and you inspire me a lot, and understand the burnout feeling. it sucks when something you enjoy feels like a chore. we'll still be here enjoying your content when you upload! :))))) 💜
Lauren I’ve been following this channel since before you and Bobby got married. Now you’re having your second child and it’s so unreal that life has changed so much. Congratulations to you and your family. Hoping for a safe pregnancy.
Congratulations to the three of you, 🎉Lauren,  Bobby and Meldoy 🎉❤️ so happy you been well even though it's been bit chaotic. So cute to see Meldoy be a Big sister!  🍼
Congratulations!! Take some time for yourself, we love you Lauren!!🍼🍼
Congratulations Lauren!!!! We love you and are here to support you always!!!! Praying for you!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🍼
I'm so happy for you I was smiling through the whole video. I can't wait to hear more, even if it's only a little bit.
I think I can speak for most of us when I say we totally support and understand your decision to keep your life more private.
You do what keeps your family safe and healthy.
I've watched you since I was about 14 years old, so for roughly 4 years now and it's been great to see you learn and become the mother you are.
You have been an inspiration, and I wish you a happy and healthy family.
Live a good and long life!🍼
🍼 GIRL CONGRATS!! 🎉 Our youngest (my only bio child) is 5 and I totally feel you on the birth not being a fun part 😂 you’re a rockstar!
🍼 I'm super happy for you both Lauren! I don't watch this channel as often anymore but I definitely still support you guys.
And I 100% with your assessment of the house - your life is a mess right now, the house doesn't need to be perfect. 
In fact, your surroundings will indirectly show what you are going through. 
That being: Yes! It's a mess, but it won't be the end of the world and it will get ""cleaned up"" so to speak.
 I hope your pregnancy continues to be quick for you so that it doesn't become too taxing on your health.
Best wishes!
Congratulations to the both of you, we can’t wait to meet the baby!

My first time seeing two meteorologists giving the weather report at the same time.  Lots of storms coming in... be safe, everybody.
I’m shocked… winter weather during winter 🥶…
I live in the snow belt of western New York State and it is in the 50's. Good luck, snow is something that happens every winter. Have fun freezing if your furnace runs on electricity.  I have wood and natural gas.
Praying for everyone’s safety.
Stay safe and warm 🙏
I don’t like it when gets  to hot or to darn cold.
It's winter. We have bad weather sometimes. We used to have it without fear-mongering. I miss those days.
I am convinced there's gonna be weather. It's coming, whatever it is. And there's gonna be a lot of it. Until it stops.
There is always so much drama with weather forecast over the last few years. I live in an area they are showing violent weather threats which is surprising. The local weather and NOAA seem to know nothing about it. Maybe the NE is going to experience a winter Nor' easter but there isn't anything threatening in the South.
I'm in an RV in east Texas with solar panels so hail and wind 🍃 are bad 😮
I like Fox, but the freaking out over winter weather like it’s the first time there’s ever been bad weather in the winter is silly
Potentially enormous cyclone set to hit Australia next week too.
How does it feel giving a weather report when you know 'they' are manipulating the weather? Does it throw a kink in everything you learned?
I live in the eastern mountain range. This weather has been very anti-snow this year. Every time it cools, it is dry and every time it warms up, it rains. 1 day of snow so far which melted in less than 3 hrs. Pre-2010, having 4 months of periodic snow was common. Post-2020 we barely have any snow. I've seen global warming in my lifetime by simply looking out my window.
Is the mountains of North Carolina going to be impacted with the rain/cold and possible chance of snow?
Texas?? It's almost clear sky and sunny with only few clouds very spaced. 😮
ive always found the weather reporting & meteorologist to be comical.
Oh how coincidental. Right on time for the anniversary of the december 10, 2021 tornado that hit dawson springs ky and took the life of my father. The longest track tornado in kentucky history.

Thanks for the detailed weather analysis and forecast. It's really helpful to be prepared for all the potential severe weather conditions coming up. Stay safe everyone!

Please I hope we get a huge roster like the old games and they don’t lock a bunch of them behind paywalls
It's absolutely crucial to feature local multiplayer. For a fighting game, not having this is a deal breaker for many people, myself included. I have so many great couch memories with the old Tenkaichi 2 and 3 split screen battles - please make it happen!
I’ve played Budokai Tenkaichi literally most of my life and NOW WERE FINALLY GETTING ANOTHER ONE. WE ARE SO BACK
Don't lock characters behind DLC and pay walls,let us unlock the roster!
I'm hoping they'll have a lot of OG DB characters on the roster. Would love to play as Piccolo Jr. or Kid Goku from the Path to Power movie.
I find myself constantly rewatching this trailer in disbelief that a new budokai tenakichi is being made it’s crazy. I still have play bt3 and rb2 to this day and a another is actually being made it’s soo surreal man thank god i lived to see this
no wonder why they took so long... they wanted to make sure they did it RIGHT 🔥🔥 Incredible
No words can express
How much I been waiting for a entry in the budokai series in a very long time! Without this series I wouldn’t have been a fan of dragon ball z or anime in general!
I've genuinely done nothing but cry this past 2 days

I just can't stop thinking about this, being alive to experience tenkaichi's return and it being so glorious
I've been watching this trailer at least twice a day since it was announced. It's amazing, and I hope it's well worth the wait!
This trailer showed me almost everything I need to know about the game play to be excited, but please don't forget one of the things that made Tenkaichi special was the uniquely cinematic character intros and the roster that included faces even harcore fans occasionally forget. 

Seeing Bergamo helped, but I would love to see this roster include more Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT characters like Jackie chun, King Chappa, Ledgic and Goku Jr.
I really hope they go ALL OUT on this for roster. Tenkaichi 3 was so crazy. I want everyone from the Pilaf Gang and Grandpa Gohan to Meta Rildo and Orange Piccolo. If the character has thrown a punch, I want them in
Better have a Hercule with infinite combo like in Budokai Tenkaichi 2
Also 1-2 Arcade mode like in 2 or 3 would be awesome! 🥰
Quase chorei ao ver esse trailer, jogo perfeitamente lindo, doido pra partir o controle jogando ele kkk
I already lost count on how many times I’ve watched this, its perfect.
Definitely gonna save up so i can buy it as soon as the preorder is available.
After waiting for 15 years we finally have the definitive sequel to this legendary series. Thank you Bandai.",20,Gaming,1090000,PT1M4S

Rated Mature",6785,"The fact they made a Free DLC is insane! Thank you PlayStation and Santa Monica Studios! You are the best
This came out of nowhere and I AM SCREAMINGGGGG. Cant express the amount of love i have for this game🤩
Santa Monica is just on an entirely different level as a dev studio.  Incredible.
The greek theme...I love this. Imagine kratos on a self-reflective journey where the final boss of the DLC is his young greek self. That would be crazy.
It is so rare these days to see a company genuinely care about their fans. Thank you Santa Monica. I will always buy your games
Kratos brutalizing enemies to his old music just hits different. And after followng his journey, ending with his new music feels very special.
The feels I just got. THIS IS WHAT GAMING USED TO FEEL LIKE!!
Thank you Santa Monica and Sony for, not only DLC to an amazing game, but the fact that it's free and not hidden behind a paywall. Very rare these days and hopefully other companies follow this standard.
Its heart warming to see one of the oldest gaming studios giving back to the gaming community, sending love!
Thank you Playstation and Santa Monica Studios for giving back to the gaming community. You guys truly are the best there is and I really hope other companies learn from the example you have set 🙏🏽
Gente, eu sou contra empresas gigantes sendo endeusadas, mas a Santa Monica Studio nunca me decepcionar. Eu sou eternamente grato às pessoas que fizeram esse jogo, pois fez parte da minha infância e manteve a qualidade, até superando! ❤
I was already going to play this game soon, but the dlc just makes me even more excited to play it
A trilha sonora do classico como é bom ouvir ela de novo
Santa Monica Studios literally never misses! I love these games to death.❤
This is the best DLC ever in gaming history and it's free.

Thank you PlayStation and Santa Monica Studio for this Masterpiece.
Escutar a música antiga deu até  calafrios de emoção!

www.jurassicparksurvival.com",6126,"Holy cow, not only is it a ""Jurassic Park"" game instead of ""Jurassic World"" to change it up, but it's a an official survival horror game we've been wanting for years? 🤯
If this is anything like Alien Isolation then we're in for the biggest treat ever. Man I love that they're going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place.
It's incredible how Jurassic Park has a different sense of tension than Jurassic World
YES FINALLY!!! I've been waiting for something like this for years 😭
To me the Ford Explorer and Jeep Wrangler will forever be the real heroes of Jurassic Park. Takes me right back to my childhood.
I can't believe they're making an actual Jurassic Park survival horror game! This looks incredible, the attention to level of detail e.g the Ford Explorer, the Jeep Wrangler, the Dinosaurs. I like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of Jurassic Park.

Hopefully this game doesn't disappoint.
I’ve always wanted a Jurassic Park game like this!!
As a huge Dino fan. This is something I’m eyeing the most to come out, I don’t care how short or long. I can tell I’m going to throughly enjoy this
The original island....the original park! This feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90's. I don't even play new games anymore, but I'm really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan. 💿 🎥
It seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now ! It looks promising !🦖💯
I've been imagining a game like this for about 20 years. They finally made one.
I’ve never wanted anything more in my life. I KNEW they were gonna do something like this at some point. So happy to finally see it.
This is what I’ve been wanting from Jurassic park!!
The makers of Jurassic World must take note from this game. This is what a true Jurassic movie should look and feel like. We need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies.
What I would really like in the game Jurassic Park Survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park, and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993, it would be completely crazy. For example we have the Proceratosaurus, the Metriacanthosaurus, the Segisaurus, Herrerasaurus and the Baryonyx, this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of Jurassic Park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear, just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film, it allows us to fill a void. 🙏
I'm going to need more gameplay footage.  Looks suspiciously like a jump-scare funhouse, walk and look adventure.
This looks incredible. Already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay. Thanks for sharing this trailer!
The music,the scenes,the dinos,same place! Everything is on point! I bet playing this will feel like a Jurassic park sequel but you are in it.
Look at how much love went into making this trailer! I haven't felt the magic this strongly since the first movie.

Lyrics:
Hotels
Late nights
Hands through my hair
Long talks
Red eyes
Clothes everywhere
Missing a moment when you’re still there
You gotta thing you can’t find nowhere 

Yeah-yeah
Kissing
Screaming
Straight back to war
I’m walking out until I lock the door
Maybe the danger’s covered by the thrill
Cause I know I should be running for the hills 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me
And keep me around like it’s easy
Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

I know that when it’s all done
I’ll hate you bad in the long run
But somehow it never ends
My heels on the edge of your bed again, yeah
I get obsessive with you
All that I want is attention from you
Break into my life and break all my rules, it’s true 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me 
And keep me around like it’s easy  

Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

Should be running for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me

Letra ✍🏼

Deseo que después de tanto llegues a mi vida.
Yo lo soñé crecio una llama que ya estaba encendida

Ahora ardo de amor mi todo 
Eres lo que le hacía falta a mi corazón
Milagro de amor bebé ni modo 
que viva sin poder sentir tu calor

Recibí la noticia que vienes
Estoy muy ansiosa por verte
En mi mente te veo y te siento
Ya quiero en mis brazos tenerte 
Tú tienes todo lo que quiero y yo
muero porque me cambies el mood
Si yo pudiera te daría to-to-to-do-o 

Quizá tuviste un problemón al momento de llegar
No sé quién cometió el error pero se pudo superar
Quizá tuviste un problemón al momento de llegar
No sé quién cometió el error pero

Ahora ardo de amor mi todo 
Eres lo que le hacía falta a mi corazón
Milagro de amor bebé ni modo 
que viva sin poder sentir tu calor

No imaginé que pudieras hacer tanto en tan poco tiempo llegaste cuando te necesitaba en el mejor momento

Cambiaste el juego ahora ya quiero que estés conmigo por siempre yo siento algo nuevo es amor no miento 
llevo adentro tu nombre

Deseo que después de tanto llegues a mi vida
Yo lo soñé creció una llama que ya estaba encendida",73493,"Coméntenme quienes ya vieron el video completo más de 5 veces 😊❤

WOOO-EEE folks. Let me tell ya, I did NOT intend for this to be such a huge project, but when Nick and I pulled up to the marketplace seller's driveway and realized this dollhouse was 5 literal feet tall, I knew I was in for a doozy. But who would I be if I let that stop me? So HERE WE GO. 
I've been seeing a lot of people online turning dollhouses into gingerbread houses, and I wanted a piece of that whimsical action. I felt like this Frozen Arendelle dollhouse would be PERFECT for a little Victorian twist. So I grabbed my spray paint, fake icing and pure determination to make this giant lady a SNACK.
Please enjoy heheheeh

#gingerbread #dollhouse #upcycling",1392,"When you said, ""What would Christine McConnell do,"" I thought, ""She'd probably bake individual shingles out of gingerbread, each with a unique design copied directly from historically-accurate examples of Victorian wallpaper, but with her own spooky spin of including a bat or a mouse in the corner of each, only visible with a magnifying glass that she.cast out of poured sugar...."" and then I got tired just from thinking about the work that goes into her (and your) projects and got a snack.
If you put the piping tip inside the snipped bag before you fill it with ""icing"" and then it stays in place while you pipe. <3
Welcome to a Rachel Maksy video where we all ask ourselves, ""What will she turn brown today?"" (with the occasional green thing)  😆  It turned out great!  Also, try putting the icing tip inside the baggie.
My 2 year old just said, “That is a cute house.” 

You have the Toddler Seal of Approval 👌
I feel like this is the home of the queen to whom your lil mouse knight pledges allegiance ❤️
You could display your gingerbread house on your porch for the season. I think it would be cute. It turned out great, by the way. The appropriate amount of whimsy.
Tip if you ever find yourself doing icing like this again: cut a hole in the pastry bag/sandwich bag and put the tip inside the bag so the tip of it comes out the hole, then twist the bag above the icing/caulk and squeeze with your hand on top of the bulb of icing/caulk. You'll get more control this way and won't have to hold the tip in place! This is how I was taught to ice cake/cookies when I worked in a bakery. :)
You made a sweet gingerbread hostel for all of your felt creatures to slumber for winter!  LOVE IT SO MUCH!!
The idea of Rachel being like ""ah yes I will do a small project! A little gingerbread house!"" And then receiving a huge castle is so funny 😂

Rachael's reaction to the size of the dollhouse was my reaction to every project I undertake. Super simple no problems at... OH MY GOSH. So relatable and delightful.
Next step, make each room Victorian themed and make miniatures. ❤
I just started watching and I am so filled with affection for Rachel, looking completely overwhelmed by the size of this monstrosity and yet also giddy with the prospect of gingerbreadifying it. Rachel Maksy, Patron Saint of Chaotic Crafters. <3
""You took a DNA test and Bob is, in fact, your uncle."" 😂😂😂❤ The gingerbread house turned out SO CUTE!
Tip for the windows:
A lot of people will use sheets of gelatin as the glass in real gingerbread houses 🥰
The peppermint patty-o was a stroke of genius.  Love it!
As someone who is a baker but also does decoden, here's some tips:  The icing tip goes inside of the bag lol. You cut the tip of the bag off, put the icing tip inside and then put your silicone in the bag. You can twist the top of the bag, rubber band it, zip tie it etc to keep the silicone from oozing out the top and it also gives you more control of the bag with applying pressure.  If you ever want to add color to your silicone you can use mica or oil based paint, no water-based colors because it will cause the silicone to seize up and then you cant pipe it!
If Rachel and Nick ever chose to have kids, they are gonna have the most whimsical childhoods.
This is becoming such a cool trend! I drove to another province to pick up one of these houses with my friend back in October so she could make an awesome haunted house for Halloween. It turned out amazing!! I love how this is catching on 🔥

- jump over walls
-Dig & pass under walls
-Crush walls in seconds
-Fly over walls

And Supercell be like:""The new level wall costs 9 MILLION coins per wall.""
😐
Isn't it funny how the cost of leveling up walls increases and the amount of troops with special abilities to go through walls also increases 😅
As a th11, I can confidently say that I'll be excited for this update in around a decade
it's amazing how far coc has come, even after 10 years i still have so much fun playing this game!!
They really made attacking at TH15 more user-friendly by introducing an OP new troop, dang

Super wall breaker would be vanished from th 16 in some extent 😂😂😂 
But loved to see new troop at new Townhall
I expect a nerf coming soon even though it's not yet officially released. This new troop is definitely overpowered. 😅
I feel like a lot of older troops are left out. Valkyrie is an apparent one, but pekka is also significantly downgraded once electro titan is announced. They should make a buff to the unusable troops.
This new troop is truly amazing! I can't wait to try it! I see it as a little slow but they have unstoppable power!
The troop is pretty interesting. It seems kind of op at this moment. It adds so much value to a hero dive without taking much space. Also seems superior to a lot of popular troops like electro titans and hogs. Interesting to see how it works out. Seems like it could break th 15 a bit
I cant wait to see the root rider dominate in pro games.
I think that the apprentice warden is going to pair really well with it. It boosts its health so much and if im not wrong it can jump over walls, if not root riders will break them anyways. 
The extra hp will be of great value, especially if u use a qc root rider attack
For the ones Who noticed two Icons above the King. 

New blacksmith building is coming to have different abilities for heroes.
Upcoming sneak peak I think It will be on our heroes( Ability charging option) or somethingmore cooler.
 I am so much excited before seeing it. 😊😊😊
I liked the troop but I think they could have game her a better ability with the root manipulation concept. Like using the roots to force stop defenses for limited amount of time.
I think they are kinda bad due to their low dps. They are more like pseudo tank that crushes walls along the way and isnt prone to spring traps so I can see them being used instead of ice golems sometimes. I think their best use case would be with super bowler smash since you would be able to use it without jump due to how good they are at breaking walls.
Always my first stop for all the new update information. Thanks Judo! All of the videos, as always, are well designed and very informative. You and the other content creators are as much a part of the game as the game itself. Keep it up my friend.
Honestly I feel like I’ve really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through an attack strategy with basic commentary! Keep it up, Judo!
To add to what judo said about using super wall breakers for king pathing. The root riders are just a normal troop whereas the super wall breaker is a super troop so you don't have use your dark elixir or super potion. I'm definitely looking forward to this troop 🔥🔥🔥",20,Gaming,2730000,PT9M1S

http://instagram.com/lenny",5531,"Instant classic, flow, knowledge, and video off the chart
Jack Harlow was smooth and held his own and Dave gotta be one of the most sickest rappers to walk the earth
Dave has literally mastered rapping at whatever pace he chooses. So relaxed and smooth man
Dave is properly a master at the verses that go on for ages. This is probably the best song I’ve heard from Jack too
Shout out to all the LOAN survivors 🙌
UK rappers are finally getting love in the US. It took way too long but anyone who hasn't been following UK Grime and Drill is going to be surprised at the talent that's been overlooked.
Harlow went fucking crazy! One of his top tracks for sure 🔥🔥
Dave is genuinely an expert at the lengthy verses. I think this is Jack's best song yet as well.
Jack’s really following his mentors footsteps with this level of consistency, he is really going places.
Man Jack’s progression is crazy🔥
Jack&dave never disappoints
They both slid!!! This beat is absolutely perfect on the ears I wouldn't mind a collaboration album from these two!! Dave is that guy !!!
Both artists ending the year with an absolute banger
The collab we didn't know we needed! Blown away both went crazy
Dope bars from both artists! The end of year collabo we didn't expect.
Can't get over how well this video is shot. Videography + editing on another level! Huge props to Cole and the crew.
This is so fire, artist's need to make more songs like this.
Jack's best verse by far, well done. Dave snapped as usual.
As espected from Dave and Jack - perfect lyrics, rythm and sound
Dave is so good with words... Look at the bars and how collected and smooth he is. Top notch delivery😊",24,Entertainment,21500000,PT4M41S

I lost my wife earlier this year. She would have loved this song. I shed tears of somberness and loneliness this Christmas. Thank you for releasing this song Simon.
XG is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained & honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly.
What an instant bop for this season!
XG brings soul back in music. They sing with their heart. Every word they say, every note they sing, every choreo, there are soulful sincere message in it. I hope they keep on doing what they doing. They are making the right choice. There are a lot of us who understand real music, talented artists. We’ve been waiting for a group like you our whole life. The fanbase keeps getting bigger. I saw new reactors everyday. They been saying you are their favorite group. So.. keep going! XG HESONO OOOOO!!!!
They really need to play this on radio in all over the US.
My great grandpa passed away in October. Its been really hard for me, and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this Christmas. Thanks, XG, for your amazing new song. 🖤
I wish XG would release a full length album with 13-14 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts🙏🤞
The gals need some radio play for this song.. it’s such a good song and deserves more people to know before Christmas
Toda vez que escuto novamente, meu coração vibra de uma maneira diferente! OBRIGADA XG 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I lost my mom this year. This song made me think of her since she loved Christmas ❤
The more i listened to the song the more it hit harder. Also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated Christmas for so long. Because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that. This song was so meaningful, thank you XG, XGALX, the creators behind it so much. For making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young 🩵🤍❄️ And yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 🩵🩵🩵
こんなに奮い立たせるような冬ソングは今まであっただろうか…

全員がエモい。誰を推すとかじゃなくて、全員ステキすぎる
It's sad how underrated this group is.
They slayed every genre..
Not only noisy music and dances
Coco's voice so warm and smooth,  I can listen to her forever. 
Juria's make me emotional.
Maya's and Hinata's voices are so pretty. I'm happy they did a lot of singing here.
Chisa always killing it.
Jurin's and Harvey's parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time.

Love them sooo sooo much
I really want to meet the person who produces/writes their stuff. It is SO authentically American 90s to early 2000s R&B it's crazy!!! Kpop often chases black culture awkwardly, but these girls TRULY pay so much hommage to it in SUCH an authentic way!! It's so amazingly beautiful! Also, Harvey...that outfit at 3:33 - I can't, girl stop...please, my heart 😍😍😍
The beauty of the song, the amazing vocals, the rap production, the beautiful harmonies, everything is perfect.
This song deserves more attention, Xg is such a talented group they’re better than the most of popular groups.
XG is slowly dominating the world. Really hoping for a live performance.
That melody is angelic OMG ✨. Maya’s part surprised me in such a good way, I love that I discover new talents from the members with every new release.",10,Music,2400000,PT4M11S

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1289,"Scary thing is this wasn’t even the worst performance of the season they have played worse against teams and won
Onana’s shot stopping comparison is a T-Rex 🦖  literally no arms!
Mark last week: Ten Hag Masterclass
Mark this week: We are a disgrace
😂😂😂
Chelsea had an awful game last game, it wasn’t that Man Utd were amazing, it was the fact that chelsea had the worst performance of their season!
We lost fair and square to a better team.
It’s very simple Chelsea didn’t play as well as this team did today. So Manchester looked good
Thought Chelsea and today were similar performances. Conceded a load of chances in both and looked on front foot. Chelsea couldn’t finish but Bournemouth could, long way to go for this team. Manager still makes same mistakes picking certain players every game
Congrats Goldbridge on predicting 3-0 scoreline👍👍👍👍
Mark has lost it...Talking about inconsistency. We have been good in one game this season, at home to Chelsea. Its factual. Defending this manager is incomprehensible.
Threw the game. They don’t want Ten Hag and they showed it and your captain doesn’t want to play Liverpool. Imagine Robson doing that?
What have you actually seen from Ten Hag to suggest he’s the right man. Like, he’s not won multiple champions leagues and dominated a top league before like a Klopp or Guardiola. I agree half the team needs clearing out but it’s also entirely possible he isn’t up to the job either. I’m genuinely shocked at how tactically naive he is and how unable he is able to actually address glaring issues in the set up.
“We’ll probably beat Bayern” 😂

Never learn goldbridge, never learn 👏😂
It’s baffling how you draw conclusions based on only looking at the performance of one team. Bournemouth outplayed Villa last week and Palace in the week. This result was no surprise to a lot of Bournemouth fans and it makes it more funny when you predicted an easy 3-0 win without doing the simplest, most cursory homework on your opposition. Up the Cherries 🍒
Our captains ""accidental"" yellow card.....
It's almost ridiculous to say we played brilliantly against Chelsea. If we had played against City or Liverpool instead of Chelsea that day, we would have conceded at least 5 goals. STILL, ETH OUT
I don't understand how you can believe this team can beat Bayern on Tuesday and at the same time not recognise that the manager is likely to be the most culpable.  He chose the captain and he carries responsibility for motivating the team.  If you think the players are good enough to beat Bayern then it seems to me that we must have the quality but not the leadership.  Personally I think we lack passion and aggression, too many prima donnas on the pitch and no Roy Keane to remind them what the job is during the game.
Onana is the biggest problem, he's simply 5 inches shorter than he should be. The other problem is the utter failure to find a ManU standard number 9 (van Persie was probably the last one).
I've come to realise that Shaw can't play LCB without Varane there to guide him.

Whoever plays with Varane looks good because he's such a good organiser and reader of the game.
ETH has made a lot of mistakes. Not handling players like he should, overpaying and bringing in mediocre footballers, overtraining players hence our long injury list, no clear tactics. It's like we've got an identity crisis. He was never the right manager to begin with. Give Klopp or Pep 400 million and they'll buy league winning players. ETH has no pulling power it's just the brand doing everything. We're done this guy needs to go.
Biggest misstake was not to listen to Ragnick. This players would not have been here if the club listen to him .",17,Sports,1790000,PT23M7S

She wanna ride with the star

I guess we both going to Mars, ok

I’m taking my mop on my dates, ok
Just look at the look on they faces
They wanna jump in my place, ok
Told shorty she was the one
But I’m taking her friends out to Tan, ok
I told ‘em to load up the dock
But they wanna ride in my Benz, ok
One of one this a new Cullinan
No telling when I’m a stand, ok
Ain’t counting no more dubs again
Only fucking with the Benjamin’s, ok

Straight off of plane to these racks
We gon’ stunt to the vibes
And we gon’ keep it going let’s go
I through a fit in Rick Owens, ok
Momma the shit and she know how she be
Ain’t just talking I got it for sure I don’t play
Send a boarding pass when she get bored, come play
Come hop in the Urus we touring you
Keep it low they know that it’s roaring
Went ceramic the Audemar blue 6v
They ain’t brought em out yet these the new ones
Having motion don’t ask what I’m doing
Tryna see if she pretty she going
Haters hate, that’s their job they gonna do it
I wear white Air Force Ones the Louie
Tell a bitch she fumble she blew it
Bro ain’t do it if the lawyer don’t prove it
She delusional making up shit in her head and believing it

She wanna ride with the star
Ended up dropping my top, ok

Only fucking with the Benjamin’s, ok

Made 100 mill and took over the street
With no sponsor man
Coming through customs
Flying through cali
They checking the jet for the contraband
Brought out the coupe
Shorty got grouped out
Told lil bitch to stay off the Gram
Don’t be the first to get hit with that drako
Soulja boy or that Aubrey Graham, don’t be playing
She holla at the moon I be barking
I am a goon she a goblin
Coke Boy like loon up in Harlem
Ramadan but we ain’t starving
Came out the mud on my own
That’s word to Rick I don’t owe ‘em
Shoot your shooter out his zone

#minecraft #secretlife",874,"The fact that I watched Cleo’s POV first and nothing  Grian did struck out of the ordinary other than when Grian asked Etho what he ate for breakfast. I thought that was weird but nothing else until I saw this.
Jimmy somehow manages to weasel his way back in 😭😭😭😭
Out of everyone to be paired together, Jimmy with Grian is the best because now Jimmy can torment Grian freely.
Jimmy and Grian are such brothers I swear! I love seeing them interact and seeing Jimmy get so excited to mess with Grian is always so funny
Etho's task must have been: Jimmy is telling Grian what to do, act as if everything is completely normal
This is honestly such a good representation of Jimmy's quick wit. Every sort of situation Grian was in he managed to find something hilarious for him to do
grian sounded really panicked  as soon as he found out lol 😅
"" the ghosts all stay above the clouds and *watch* ""
whoa, Jimmy, you just created lore.
This is the furthest that Jimmy has ever made it in a Life series. He may not be there in physical form, but he's there in spirit!
I like how Timmy tries to embarrass grian but it backfires.
The absolute sheer joy jimmy had doing this is absolutely making my day
forcing someone to be weird on this server literally has no effect.  People have been weird since day one.  Etho's first episode here was titled ""Server full of weirdos"".
I would love to see a future installment of the Life Series use a gimmick where dead players can stick around as guardian angels for the living players.
When the world needed him the most, he came back
Funny how the secret keeper allowed jimmy back as a ghost instead of letting rejoin in a different name with a mustache just like in the hardcore series grian did with scar and joel 😂😂😂😂😂
Seeing an episode from spectator mode is actually really fun, not to mention this particular task was fantastic
Knowing Etho's strategy has been to do weird things so people couldn't guess his task, he probably just assumed Grian was doing the same thing, on top off Etho just being a chill person in general and not minding other peoples business too much.
""The leaves are all pointing upward.""
*Etho and Cleo appear out of nowhere*
Kinda cute that Jimmy used Grian to woof at Martyn from beyond the grave
Observation. Jimmy spent most of the time just kinda playing around with Grian. but the instant genuine danger gets presented to him, he drops the light tone and warns him
The canary stopped singing to warn him",20,Gaming,1200000,PT24M40S

Estas canciones son las que curan el corazón ❤️‍🩹
Letra: 🤍

(Jay Wheeler)
No encuentro el café que me quita el sueño de estar contigo
Tu perfume está en el aire y me acuerdo de ti cuando respiro 
Sigo esperando una señal confírmame si el tiempo lo he perdido (si el tiempo lo he perdido) 
O si todavía en tu corazón queda el espacio para guardar el mío

(Coro)
Tal vez piensas que estoy loco, pero si estoy loco creo es por  ti
Nuestro lugar favorito no se siente igual cuando no estás aquí
Intenté sentirte cerca viendo nuestra foto y no lo conseguí 
Un beso no fue suficiente cuando me despedí
Yo sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta
Seguiré buscandote, te necesito para curarme el alma 
Yo sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta 
Desde la última vez, quiero verte otra vez 

(Zhamira)
Ay que frío se siente cuando no estás 
Me da miedo si te escribo y no contestas
Quisiera que se repita, la mariposa de la primera cita
Pa' que me confirme que esto no fue invano dame la mano, quiero volver escucharte decirte te amo, no puede ser casualidad, tan poco suerte, está distancia me da más ganas de verte 

(Coro)
Tal vez piensas que estoy loca, pero si estoy loca creo es por  ti
Nuestro lugar favorito no se siente igual cuando no estás aquí
Intenté sentirte cerca viendo nuestra foto y no lo conseguí 
Un beso no fue suficiente cuando me despedí
Nos sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta
Seguiré buscandote, te necesito para curarme el alma 
Yo sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta 
Desde la última vez, quiero verte otra vez 

Nos sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta
Seguiré buscando te necesito para curarme el alma
Yo sigo extrañandote y estar contigo es lo que me haces falta
Desde la última vez, quiero verte otra vez.

It's actually nice to see Vivek and Ron treat each other well on the debate stage.
This has to be the best debate compared to the other 3. They actually debated and spoke on important policies/issues.
It's wild that if you Google Vivek right now you see every media outlet slamming his performance and even one site stating a pole that he was voted the worst performer at this debate yet you come to the comments and get the complete opposite lol. They are going to do everything to keep him out because they are scared. It's hilarious yet also terrifying and sad to see. VIVEK 2024!!
Vivek had me literally dying of laughter making fun of Haley’s blank stare when asked about which 3 provinces in Ukraine we should be protecting
Vivek is just too good. That's how a world leaders should be.  America is lucky to have such a brilliant candidate. Big W for him.
Vivek is savage and I absolutely love it. He’s the only one on that stage who is not robotic.
Vivek knows all the subject matter that President should know, and no one can get past him.
Vivek won - hands down 🙌 he’s crystal clear with his ideas
Vivek crushed it!!! I like DeSantis a lot too. The moderators are obviously bias and against Vivek.
Vivek is actually super impressive. He must have read a large library of information. You can hear it when he speaks.
Vivek makes more sense than others.
Vivek is spot on - tells it like it is and sometimes truth hurts ""no more American tax payer dollars for foreign wars""
Desantis and Vivek teaming up on Haley has to be one of my favorite things I’ve seen all week.
Good lord Christy is acting like a moderator and time keeper😂😂
Vivek is too much! He is exactly what America needs and everyone on that stage should be supporting him and his wisdom instead of fighting him or being against him. I believe Desantis now gets that! I see the two being the only ones remaining on the last stage and Vivek will win! Congratulations Vivek. A voice and a true leader for the young generation of America! 🙏🏽
Thank you NewsNation for making this available to everyone. Great job on questions and monitoring the debate.
Vivek dominated again. Congrats Vivek 💪🏻💪🏻
Vivek is speaking what every American wants!!! why isn’t our government listening to its people? Until we have a government that listens to its people, no political view stands!!
By far the best debate of the 4. The candidates actually had time to speak and you know actually debate each other! Thanks NewsNation.",25,News & Politics,1080000,PT1H42M3S

New ecosystems, new creatures, a mount that let's you glide from high falls, everything from this trailer brought me joy and I absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar.
SO EXCITED!!!  (づ｡◕‿◕｡)づ⭐
This is what I always wanted to see in monster hunter. Large flocks of animals, more ambiant mega-fauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs.

It will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem, can't wait to see what they cook up for us.
As a fiver, it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of Monster Hunter. I am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
""I'll let it speak for itself"" is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement, you know that Monster Hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds.
The amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster (and Rath ofc) is actually stunning to me. Didn't think they had it in them.
Seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment, as well as one another, has got me feeling the same giddiness I had seeing the Monster Hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time. This franchise is in my blood man!
One of my friends got me into MH back when World was announced. I played World/Iceborne and Rise/Sunbreak. 3000+ hours combined later, this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time. Here’s to hunting with everyone in 2025, let’s go!
Here's the most anticipated game for me until it comes out. Very hard to top it from my list. 
MHW have such a special place in my gamer heart.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING! It gives me very open worldish vibes! I would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting, exploring, and researching kinda vibe.
The little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic.
From that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in. The synth stuff being used is really new to MH or at least it hasn't had a very large presence. They mainly kept to orchestration.

But all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme.

Truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack.
MHW was my first introductory into the franchise. It became and still remains my favorite game ever. and I started at the base Nintendo system. This game just brought joy to my heart.
Love the little bit they showed here, the movement feels like a mix of Worlds more Methodical speed and Rises more open verticallity
I absolutely loved World's ecosystem simulation, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game!
I thought you couldn't get better than the Palamutes... I was so wrong. Though the mount's different movement types kinda make me think of Koraidon and Miraidon- the Pokemon mounts from Scarlet and Violet. It's a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great. I love this creature and I want twelve of them.
Bro, when I was going into the Game Awards, I had the lowest of low expectations…but then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interested…and then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me. I am hyped beyond belief, even if 2025 is quite a long wait, I am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon!
I want them to bring back 16 person hubs. So much more lively for my 7-12 person groups. It felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world.
One of my friends got me into monster hunter. My first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since. Cant wait to see what the new game brings ❤
I'm reaching that phase in my life where i really don't feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thought...so damn excited :)",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S

A tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
This is an AWESOME turn for the channel! And they don't even always have to be death matches, they could be races to loot or securing an area. Team death matches would be a treat too!
The animation team did a fantastic job! And congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
As an animator myself, Ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew --- theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics. Ive seen hollywood do far worse.

Props all-round -- Super keen to see more of these styles of videos!
As someone who loved watching The Most Extreme as a kid on Animal Planet, I appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly. The only thing missing was the music used in the show.
Dang, the fight choreography was so good! All the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary, but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging. The Cat noticing the raptor, the bluffing, the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor, the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack, and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points.

Such good work!
I didn't realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality... being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content. Incredible work
The animation on this episode is exceptional! Kudos to Kuzim and WobblyWorks!
I've always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a CG character believable, and I'd say this is proof of that
I love this so much!! As a big fan of the iconic ""Animal Face Off"" series back in the day, it's nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback. Awesome stuff as always!
The animations here are crazy cool -- hoping to see more in the future!
This channel has been great the whole time it’s existed, and the skill going into production has been increasing. Thanks for existing!
I'm a long-time fan of Kuzim's art, and it's so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel!
Wow, such a good pilot! This gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on TV, but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe. Congratulations to the whole team.

I just missed your ""gaming guide"" style of writing. This one was professional, succinct and great, but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction.
Sadly I don’t think these videos will hit your normal view count, but please don’t stop making them. The series from this would be amazing and WILL blow up. Great job on the animation from your team.
At first I was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality, fearing they finally dropped the ball on Outside’s legendary graphics. But then I realized this is a user made mod made from scratch. Not bad at all! And a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing! Would love to see more content in this mod.
2 years well spent, this is amazing!! Truly top tier content every single time. TierZoo just doesn't disappoint
The step up in animation is phenomenal! Can't wait to see what you do with it next.
Incredible! Have loved the tier lists for several years now and this brings an exciting new dimension to the channel. Look forward to more of these",27,Education,3650000,PT6M57S

Who else cannot wait to see the feud between Rollins and Punk officially kick off in a head to head confrontation?
“I don’t know who’d feel comfortable working with somebody who randomly punches people backstage.” Cm Punk Is Cold AF Bro AEW Brawl Out Got Mention on A WWE Show Gotta Love It
If AJ Lee comes back for a while, it would be awesome to see her and CM Punk in a mixed tag match against Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch.
Now THIS was the CM Punk that've all been waiting to see!
That was pretty much the perfect CM Punk promo. Controversial. Inside jabs. Calling his shots. Mission statement. Very well done
He choked up when he said ""WrestleMania."" This is real for him.
What a time to be a wrestling fan.  The crowd was electric, not only for punk, but every person he mentioned.  I think we're finally in the Era where we don't need legends anymore, we got some mega-stars right now.
Having both Cody and Punk passionately chasing the main event of Wrestlemania is going to be very entertaining.
Punk putting LA Knight over was golden❤️
Feels like 2013 all over again with Cole and JBL and Punk
It's funny watching wrestlers get high on the crowd's reactions.  I'm here for it.  😆
It feels so surreal to have Punk back
He seems genuinely happy to be in WWE.
Love him or hate him, his promos never get old.
Punk’s voice cracking while talking about main eventing Wrestlemania really showcased the emotion perfectly. The landscape is perfect to have him wrestle the main event against Seth
Hate that the “ you can’t be punching people backstage” didn’t get a better reaction. That was amazing
I like how they’re being conservative with his appearances and not over-doing him every week like AEW did
He honestly does look more happier
I can't lie this is truly good to see I've been a CM Punk fan since 2004 hope his run is as epic as his first with WWE",17,Sports,420000,PT11M26S

I approve
No way new HelloGames game?!

I love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that NMS trailers usually are.
Can't wait for this, looks beautiful!
The fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very, very good thing. That's a sign that they're aiming for density on a much smaller scale, despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
I genuinely cannot wait.  You guys are some of the hardest working devs around and I really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making NMS an incredible game. I’m more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything I love in one game. So excited!!
Seeing how far they've come with NMS compared to its initial release makes this game very promising. Even if it's not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning, we no they're 100% capable of making it better over time.
As a NMS player since day one, I'm all in for Light No Fire!
After the (eventual) epic success of NMS, Hello Games is now one of the few game developers I trust to deliver. I can't wait to explore this world.
Having witnessed the commitment they have shown to No Mans Sky, I’m all in on this. (Also No Mans Sky on PSVR2 is INSANE!)
I like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on (Larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year), I am genuinely excited for this! I can see this being a huge improvement from NMS for the simple reason it's just one world which they can build on density.
Love the artstyle!! Looks really interesting and after delivering NMS you really deserve that this will be a success!
What I’m hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards, and some kind of engaging story. If they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
Everything about this is pure vibes. The atmosphere, the track selection for the video, the editing. Very well done. Cannot wait to play this!!!
I don’t even know how I feel, no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre, and you guys delivered that 🎉😂 can’t wait
I just want to say, I'm a huge fan of your guys' work. You guys put passion first and money second, unlike the vast majority of companies today.
Feels like a natural next step from something like Valheim, which is probably my favourite game ever. Excited for this. The redemption story is nearly fully complete.
I cherish each of you! transforming an incredible system into a fantastical setting. Great choice of song as well; I adore Alt-J. I'm already very excited about this.
This looks great. Take your time guys. It's done when it's done. Don't let yourselves get pushed like last time. You've build a lot of good will over the years, the community is ready to wait and let you cook.
I remember playing nms and thinking about how much better it would be if you guys focused all the procedural content into one planet  (  not saying your procedural universe was bad )  turns out you guys were already making that a reality long before I ever even conceived it....I dont usually get hyped for games....but I am completely hyped for this one.
This is going to be an amazing experience. I hope it has full mod support.",20,Gaming,115000,PT2M6S

We're all sad that you left the private lifesteal smp, but we are all happy to see you still thrive in other sectors and most importantly, in the public lifesteal server! I've always loved your videos and their unique style(ofc with a bit of rekrap charm), and  I'll keep watching them no matter what!!! ❤
Im so glad a project youve poured your heart in is finally active, it is so fun to see<3

Rekrap: Immediately attempts to block glitch.
MANNN THAT WAS SO FUN! Your base looks so cool, I really hope no one finds it from this video that'd be unfortunate XD
Very cool video, fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one!
@rekrap2 Just wanted to let you know: since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the ""target block"" and ""target fluid"" on the bottom right since they show exact coords.
@rekrap2 Just letting you know, if you want to properly blur your coordinates, you also need to blur the ""chunk coordinates"" Which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks... Edit: After trying to figure out if you gave info away, I have found that you did block it. Sorry.
Seeing Rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
Hey Rek, it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown over the past couple of years form EcoCraft to Life-steal then the race to 1M with parrot then to commentary, speed runs, Hoplite and so much other amazing content. Thank you so much for entertaining me over the years.
I'm so happy that you made this video. I enjoy watching these types of  thanks Rek keep up the good work !
Watching secret life has made me extra anxious watching anyone playing on a server. I especially skipped a beat when the meteor dropped on your head lol
Edit: This was a really fun video
You HAVE TO make this a series, it’s soo good!
I can't wait to see more of this, looks super cool. Would like to play, but starting late is rough
This was really fun to watch. Those POI and the unique mechanics were great.
Oh my god this is so much fun!! I can’t wait to see what else will come in this series.

Garnacho's goal is absolutely momentous!! Honouring the club's icons fr, well done
Garnacho scoring like Rooney, celebrating like Ronaldo, and being from Messi's country is pure football magic.
I bet Garnacho is watching the clip back  a million times and continuously smiling at himself 👊🏻 what a goal.. 👏🏼
Got garnacho’s goal on replay! Kid has all the potential in the world! 
Bruno giving Rashy the PK was class 🙌🙌
Great finish from Martial! Very composed. 
Having Shaw and Mainoo back is a breath of fresh air
We have to keep this kid at all costs. Not every player can score a bicycle kick but to score it in the 2nd minute like it's nothing is quite something
Mainoo was unbelievable. He made a huge contribution. Kudos to Garnacho !!!!!
What a Goal. Garnacho Wow. He is a true fan of Cristiano
This goal is remarkable for more than 100 years.. pure talent garnacho!
That’s THE greatest goal I’ve ever seen live from Garnacho. He runs about 5 steps away from the goal and still managed to get the power and the height he needed😵‍💫😵‍💫
What a historical moment for Him. This one just went up there with the one of Rooney vs Man city. He even sealed it off with a CR7 celebration. Well done man.
I'm a Liverpool fan and even I have to admit this is probably one of the best goals I've ever seen. You guys have a gem in Garnacho, please keep him.
As a Liverpool fan, Garnacho's goal deserves to be the best goal in the Premier League this season and is nominated for Puskas 2024. What a goal 👍
Garnacho's goal was unstoppable 🔥❤
You can't get over that Garnacho goal
I love Gernacho's goal celebration... Right on point
Aint no way garnacho 😱 now that was SIUUUUPER INSANE 🔥
When Bruno is on point...😎 there is no more simplicity than his passes 👏
What a goal by Garnacho… truly amazed 🤘

#FF7R #PS5",3100,"This game is gonna make me shed so many tears and I am so here for it!!! Cant wait for February already!!! who else pre-ordered?
God, that last shot of Aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds.
Cid's voice sounds great! Can't wait to see more of him in this game
The thing I'm looking forward to the most is the Dyne plot line. It seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around, and barret was already so good in Remake.
This game is literally the only reason I’m going to buy a ps5. In the original, Midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game. I can’t wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror.
Aerith's new white dress is so pretty! Did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral?
So excited for this game!!!
Props to Loren Alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game. truly magnificent ❤❤🤩
So niceeeeee!! Cid and Vincent in the party, Cloud and Aerith, Barret's story...the Gold Saucer!!! and Marlene there with Cloud and Zack, so insane!! looking forward to playing the second part!
Im emotional already... who knew the impact and trauma FFVII would cause a whole generation
Cid was one of my favorite characters in the original FF7, can't wait to play as him again in this remake.
I love Aerith so much, I teared up. Beautiful song ❤
I love Dyne's voice. Well, everyone looks amazing!
Oh my gosh, Cloud and Aerith just two inches away from each other ❤❤❤❤
I still have Phantom Pain from 26 years ago..... That last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th Time
This is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers.  And I don't think it's going to end the way we suspect.  It won't be smiles and rainbows, but I don't think Aerith is going to die, either.  If she did, then it would beg the question of what this was all for.  We know this isn't a true remake, but a sequel to the original game.  (The true remake is Ever Crisis.)
Quite possibly the greatest game ever made
I nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer... I'm not ready for this, I just want to see these characters I grew up with have a happy ending. But I know the journey of Rebirth won't be an easy one... Final Fantasy for Life!
Nobuo Uematsu is truly a legend. He just knows how to make music fit the themes of Final Fantasy games so well. Can't have Final Fantasy without Nobuo you just can't. This song may possibly be the signature theme of FFVII games from now on. The ending for FF VII is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this. I'm looking forward to when that day comes.
Just when I thought my hype couldn't get any bigger! I haven't even played this game yet and I can already tell it's going to be one of my favorite games of all time.
One of my favorite trailers ever this is gonna be a masterpiece",20,Gaming,172000,PT2M37S

Just realized Paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady.  She’s basically a drone.
I just hope furina gets the well deserved hug. That she didn't receive.
Would be so cool if Navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  😭
Furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished. Love that for her.
Rip Meluse and Silver. Went out as heroes even beyond the grave. Rest well. 🫡
Teleporting right to the ""key"" in domains is going to be a MASSIVE time saver. I can't even count how many hundreds of times I did the sprint along the entrance stairs.

Fontaine enabling a non-hydro related reaction with Chevreuse is really an unexpected move
You know historically both France and Japan have had influence each other in some point in time (especially artistically), so seeing Inazuma chars in Fontaine, doesn't surprise me in the least lol.

This special program is the second one that actually made my day!)) And Zhongli's art at the last seconds of this program made me internally SCREAM!!!!!....)))) 😍😍 Can't wait for two online concerts and a new album of characters OSTs 🥰🥰
This patch for TCG is the closest we'll get to Signora being a playable character.
Thank you dev team for all those system optimizations! We appreciate you! 🙌✨
I’m smiling for this Genshin baby!
Damn Furina’s PTSD kicking in with the word ‘wave’ is so on point, and I love how she is happy now.
Furina being a director!?? Cries she seems so happy!!!!!! I love her it's so grest she gets to do what she loves and be free now. And the film event looks AMAZING!!! litterly looks like the MOSTFUN version EVER!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Out of all the news shared, I’m definitely hyped that we finally get to grace our ears with Wanderer’s theme with Stellar Moments Vol.4 outside of his character demo and covers.
I love the enthusiasm the voice actors bring to the show (and the game!). Must be really fun to work in a project like this 😌
Zhongli skin at the end of the special program is 🤩🤩🤩. I wish the team make it available for us.",20,Gaming,7120000,PT39M46S

I am absolutely certain that if 1% of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did, regardless of what that may be, to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place.
Thank you James for encouraging people, through coffee, to do more, do better and question what they do.
The reason you're not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process. No idea the details of how the machine works, but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains.
It’s fascinating that the spritzing makes a MEASURABLE difference to the extraction of the espresso. I could totally see “well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality it’ll probably never mean anything,” but it’s amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful, quantitative change.
I love the citizen science your channel is promoting, and that you're encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared. There is a signal here, we just can't see it yet. Keep sharing, keep signal boosting, and keep experimenting!
If you close your eyes you can experience what it’s like to have Jon Hamm describe coffee physics to you
I think when collecting data from lots of people, tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important. I keep my house really dry (~30%) for 3D printing, and I see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder, which doesn’t have any bottleneck. So RH may be a significant source of noise.
I’m not sure why the links aren’t showing for some people. Here they are:

It’s always a pleasure to watch these videos. And even more of a pleasure to watch James slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
Decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago.  Somehow forgot that I’d since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat.  While I can’t endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder, it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real Proustian moment while I played “what the hell is that weird perfume flavor?”
My suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed, which usually I would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry. The oils in the coffee also probably don't help with that. If you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil, you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference. So a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming, leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates. This is not contrary to what the prof said. It might be a combination of both.
Even though I'm not ""that into"" coffee and usually just guess each time I make it, I absolutely love your videos. It's not just the information, but the candor, the dedication without obsession, and the curiosity. I wish there were clones of you making YouTube videos on different topics - it'd be a better world.
This is fascinating!  There's a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee.  I've been freezing beans for freshness since I use coffee pretty slowly.  An unintended result is that when I take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind, pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold.  It's like getting a mist and mix for no effort.  Hard to control the amount (which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room), but interesting nonetheless.  I've also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my Breville Barista Express or my Fellow Ode gen 1, and not surprisingly I've had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders.
Man, this video is surreal. I don't think I ever had a chance to meet him specifically, but I was just at a small conference with Chris Hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research. I don't think I've ever seen someone I've encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this. I suspected that he or his work about coffee (though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry) would show up here eventually though. Super exciting stuff!
I am SUPER excited that you got a particle size analyzer, and from a legit analytical science company like Anton Paar. That is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders, burrs, grind RPM, etc, which so far has been limited to assumptions. Wow! That instrument is a significant investment too and I'm thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune, so to speak, can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere!

I'm assuming we'll be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument. Can't wait =)
I used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published. My grinder is the new Fellow Opus. It was the first time I did it with the Opus because I never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech. And I was so surprised that when wet, it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when it’s dry. Now that this paper has been published, I’m going to try it again!
James, I would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from, particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind. My theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators. I think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders -- the Eureka Mignon Oro has a metal spout and cup.
I just tried spritzing for pour over coffee. There was less static cling, which was nice. I also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower. I only did it once so it could be a fluke.
Well done Chris and his fellow authors as well as you James. What shocks me is that there isn't more science on how to improve the taste of coffee. Probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively. But there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques.
Just a simple thank you James for all you do. Endlessly fascinating to me, and rewarding every time I make my coffee.",24,Entertainment,1930000,PT19M37S

Legendary.
Tyler and Bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots. They endured siting/standing in a wall and floor for 3 hours.
JT fan favourite? The insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though, especially when James said how disgusting that would be. Like what's coming next year, hiding in the septic tank?
JT hiding in plain sight was awesome
Funniest has to be JT and Andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while James goofed around with his card trick, but Tyler and Bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure. Hard to pick between the 2 though
Wow! Lots of good hiding spots this year!

It's be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in...
Honestly, Tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all. Bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening, but Tyler's had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile.
I’m surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid. I was most impressed with JT hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently.
Someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year.
If the Hacksmith Industries ever move to another building, the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property.
The insulation hiding spot was 200iq. When James pulled out the thermal camera, I thought “he is not going to find that person with the camera”.
I love how much team work they put in, and I love how often James walked past some people in plain sight lol
JT hiding was the best I've ever seen. Dude was just sitting there like nobody's business while James was running around. Legendary.
I really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building. This is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever.
JT's hiding spot deserves commendation, James was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
This looks like so much fun! Despite the high-pressure work environment and the demands of producing YouTube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech, y'all still manage to bring your A game to hide-and-seek. Great job!
JT hiding right in front James at the desk was by far the best, even though he got caught eventually.
I feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead... build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings...
If I had a nickel for every time I saw a YouTube based company playing hide and seek with their employees, I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened right
JT keeping his cool with James leaning over his shoulder was _absolutely_ the best! That said, Tyler's hole in the floor was prolly the most effective spot.",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT21M1S

#TCoFS #DbD",2926,"For people who are confused:

This is a brand new single player game set in the dbd universe, featuring as far as we know original characters (who will likely come to dbd as skins or characters in the future). This is made in collaboration with Supermassive games, who are known to be behind “Until Dawn”, “The Quarry”, and “The Dark Pictures Anthology”. This game will likely be in a style where the player makes choices that will alter the story. It will release sometime in 2024.

By the way, the song is “Daylight” by David Kushner
This game has gone so far it's insane
It actually looks SO good! More Dead by Daylight lore. I can't wait!
This could be Supermassive's best game since Until Dawn. Well done to both companies, I'm excited! 🎉 🥳
I love how his helmet is shaped like Entity's jaws, solid way to reveal more about the character through his design
Something about seeing ""from the world of Dead By Daylight"" with solemn music in the background is emotional. Like, for the past 7+ years, excitement around Dead by Daylight had always been about what outside thing they brought in, like license chapters. For the first time, hype is generated by someone else announcing that they are collaborating with Dead By Daylight. Im also so excited to be able to see Dead By Daylight in a more cinematic lense, finally being able to properly experience the horror of DBD
There’s a lot of symbolism in the name “The Casting Of Frank Stone” Frank Stoke being some form of character. Casting either being casted by the entity for what we know as “The Trials” or casting in terms of being shaped or molded by the entity. As well as casting and stone in the title could imply the saying “Casting the first stone” so this may very well be some form of beginning to the story we know, this may have been where the first stone of our story is casted.
I like how the killer already looks so unsure about what he wants to do and what he’s becoming and when he’s shown off in the mask it looks like he’s just exhausted and so regretful of whatever deal he made with the entity
You guys have NO IDEA how happy I am to see you two collab together! Can't wait for this game!
If they really want this to feel special, I hope we also get to make choices from the killer POV. Remember that most killers are as much victims of the entity as the survivors and want to escape this purgatory.
Some hunches I have about this game

1. This could possibly be the first killer that arrived in The Entities realm and tells the story about how he got there before being tossed into The Void
2. The screams in the background are most likely the four main characters being held captive by said killer who at some point during the game manage to escape and you have to help them make it out alive. 
3. The Entity's full physical form is seen for the first time, that being a gigantic spider. While it is said that the realm itself IS The Entity (ex. Trees, Birds, pallets etc) on the official DBD wiki it states that The Entities most preferred form is that of a Spider, resembling something from Stephen Kings IT. 
4. It's my strong hunch that whoever it is that is supposed to canonically survive the game will most likely show up as a future survivor in the core game. 

All in all I'm really excited for this game, can't wait to get my hands on it.

Edit: When I was looking at the steam page for the game, I also noticed a pharmaceutical store that had ""Afterpiece Tonic"" on it, so we'll probably get to meet a younger version of The Clown at some point? Or maybe a close relative that refers to him.

Edit 2: Did some thinking and I believe that we will experience the 4 main characters get taken by The Entity, which will result in them encountering Frank Stone and we will experience a full trial in a more cinematic perspective. This would explain why his workbench is covered in nature by the time the others show up. So before that happens, it’s really more so getting to know the towns history and the scars Frank left behind.
This is an infinitely more interesting collaboration than I thought it was going to be. Would be super fun to get some outfits or even chapters related to their other games
Felt a surprising amount of emotion from this trailer. Very well made!
You can see the reference from the song itself, Frank doesn't really want to kill but he's being forced by the entity.

""Hiding all of our sins from the daylight""  His eyes speaks from the sins he committed, such a powerful trailer indeed.
I’m crying seeing how far and how much dead by daylight has grown and I get a shot of nostalgia whenever I play this game
Finally expanding the DBD franchise in a way that makes the most sense. Not everyone likes 4v1’s. But a LOT of people like horror based story games. 

Imagine new characters or existing characters story fleshed out in an interactive way. 

THIS is a good sign.
this has to be one of my FAVORITE trailers you guys have made, the music, the animation its just great
For anyone wondering what the gameplay and chase sequences will be like:

Most of the game is cutscenes where you make choices that determine events that happen and who lives/dies. All action sequences during the game are also cutscenes with things like ""Quick Time Events"". For example, if you had to jump over a pallet to escape the killer in the game a buttom would appear on the screen. If you press the button before it vanishes you jump over the pallet, if you don't then the character is either permenantly dead or lives through luck somehow. The rest of the gameplay while not being chased will basically be 3rd person and you will just walk around through areas finding clues and trying to escape.

Also if you want more games like this check out Until Dawn, The Quarry, and the 4 games in the Dark Picture Anthology
This trailer is a masterpiece, this music and this camera optics.👍
Perfect music choice, i am so in. This has to be one of the best directed trailers for anything I have ever seen. Well done on both companies, you guys knocked it out of the park.",20,Gaming,1060000,PT1M46S

 Severe storms that tore through central Tennessee killed six people Saturday and sent about two dozen to the hospital as homes and businesses were damaged in multiple cities.

Three people, including a child, were killed after an apparent tornado struck Montgomery County north of Nashville near the Kentucky state line, county officials said in a news release. And the Nashville Emergency Operation Center said in a post on a social media account that three people were killed by severe storms there. Montgomery County officials said another 23 there were treated for injuries at hospitals.",123,"Hopefully everyone is able to get the help they need and my condolences to those lives lost in the storm 🙏🏾

These are the last of the ""Last Day's"" Matthew 24:3-17. Jesus said it would be this way during the time of his ""Presence"" and the ""Conclusion"" of this system of things. He said there would be ""Fearful Sights"" during this time period. Compare Luke 21:11. Seek God and his righteousness while he still may be found. Zephaniah 2:3.

thank you media respected sir s this incident is very pain all of us I tribute who loss their lives thank you God bless you
Omg, a child…heartbreaking right before Christmas. Prayers for sure😞
Yep. We’ve had storms forever
Also hit near Ft Campbell,Kentucky and damaged homes in Oakgrove outside gate.
Reverand Pat Robertson of the 700 Club came to me in a dream and told me that God did this to the hateful Red State to punish them for the elected officials passing hate filled laws/rules. Pat told me ""to love thy neighbor"". Shalom

This video is a beautiful reminder of the goodness in the world. Uplifting!
Sorry about the tragedy and the people that were harmed. But this is the opportunity for the government to do something with the migrants. use the infrastructure money to help them rebuild that city that town that state.  In that way, they become productive citizens.
The infrastructure money will be used to bless them and to give them opportunity to provide for their family. Period everybody comes out of winter even in this tragic situation

LYRICS:
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Why don’t you just come over
You’ve been acting so cold
No I don’t want nothing crazy
Just wanna get you alone
And all of the snow is falling
I can make you fall too
So tell me whats on your wishlist
I want to make it come true
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can’t I be the one
To give you everything you want
I just want you to tell me that you feel the same
I don’t think I’m going to make it through the winter babe
Well don’t you want to wrap me up
And mistle touch under the tree
He won’t bring you somebody that loves you more than me
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can’t I be the one
To give you everything you want
You’re going to leave me all alone, on Christmas?
Baby, what’d I ever do to deserve all that?
Can’t we just like, snuggle?
Underneath the tree
By the fireplace
You know I make those cookies you like
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
Well maybe this Christmas time
You’ll finally realize
That I could be the one
To give you everything you want

SHE CAN SING, ACT, DANCE....SHE REALLY CAN DO EVERYTHING!
She's feeding us with this holiday bop⭐
She's a triple threat, she can sing, act and dance. THE PRODUCTION AMAZING AND SUCH A HOLIDAY BOP 😍❤️
I'm so serious, this needs to become a Christmas classic. A beautiful sad Christmas song about wanting someone to notice you in time for the holidays that happens to be so true for so many people.
sabrina you're literally saving the music industry. you're literally a princess i just don't know how to say it. but thank you from the bottom of my heart.
""HE WON'T BRING YOU SOMEBODY, WHO LOVES YOU MORE THAN ME!!!"" wrote the lyrics brilliantly and her voice ❤
she really deserve global artist of the year 2024 let's keep on loving her by her entire being and her charismatic voice too guys let's do love her
She needs to win a Grammy ASAP 🤞🙌💓
I´m sure this will be a Christmas classic song forever. Thank you so much Sabrina.
I could go on and on with my praises for the lyricism but as far as the music video is concerned, it's so simple in the best way and I love it! It's cute, romantic, and lighthearted with definitely some undertones of nostalgia/regret. The video paired with the actual lyrics make you yearn for that special person, like you're missing someone either first-hand or second-hand (if you’ve never been in a relationship/onesided crush/situationship). I love this, THANKS SABRINA!! Merry Christmas ❤️❄️
I love that she’s releasing Christmas music, so versatile!!! It’s amazing and has so many og songs🙂
A química que eles exalam, a voz dela, a atuação, a vibe, o carisma deles, perfeito
Is it just me or does she give that 90's vibe we all need 😊. Love everything about her❤
the fact that all her videos are like movies . the creativity is unmatched . 💯her , her voice , perfect .
In my humble opinion, Sabrina is the hardest working and most under-appreciated female artist out there today.  AWESOME talent, as everyone else on here has pointed out.  And apparently has been more successful than some of the Disney alumni at keeping her head on straight.  I'm always anxious to see what she chooses to do next!
This song is pure magic! Sabrina's vocals are on point, and the music video is a visual treat. It's definitely going to be on my holiday playlist. 🎄✨
I swear this song is going to be a new Christmas classic. ❤
i’m just speechless by Sabrina’s beauty. I love her sm !!!! Glad shes getting the praise she deserves.
not the fruitcake song i was expecting to get a mv but definitely one of her best out there🥰 she just never disappoints",10,Music,2200000,PT3M41S

Only Sega can show up with FIVE announcers in one go! *AND THEY ALL LOOK AWESOME!* Can't wait to play 'em, guys!
Now THIS is the SEGA we remember! These legends will never die.
That Sega scream at the end was the cream of the crop! Shows that Sega is back again and more badass than ever!!
The ""SEGA!"" at the end really tide it all nicely. Nice touch. Hopefully this means SEGA really coming back to it's arcade-y roots and feeling cool.
I am so PSYCHED to see a return for Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Shinobi!!! First Sonic is coming out with hit after hit, now it looks like Sega is bringing ALL the classics back! Let’s make it the year of Sega!
Good to see ya back to your true form, Sega. We missed ya.
To be this good takes AGES, to be this good takes SEGA! 💙
Crazy Taxi is such a great game as is to see it get fresh updated graphics, it looks so good. Can’t wait for this to come out.
I never thought I'd ever see a new jet set radio again... I am so damn happy! Sega remember you have a huge catalog use it!!!
You still got it, SEGA. Give these franchises the love they deserve, give us the quality we remember from the late 80s and 90s.
Literally one of my two favorite announcements that was made during TGA. WE ARE SO BACK.
So excited to see these announcements, thank you Sega for finally listening after all these years! This is something I thought I would never see, it's been so long. I'll for sure be purchasing each game, physical special edition! So many great memories of wonderful and creative Sega games in the past that I loved. Now... if only we can get a real new modern Sega console released before I die, would be the cherry on top!
This is insane! I was waiting so many years for a proper continuation of these classics! Soooo happy to see them return!
Holy guacamole! A new 2d shinobi?? That's one of my childhood dreams. I love all these games. It's about time Sega did something with them. They're very popular in the retro community
let me mark jet set radio off on my gaming bucket list.
sega, you're killing it with this art style.
SEGA, nunca saíste do meu coração! s2
I'm actually really glad that Sega has decided to bring back some of these older IPs from the 16 bit Genesis era Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Shinobi. Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi from the Dreamcast days is a great return as well. Sonic franchise though I've been a fan of the Blue Blur since I was a kid it definitely is time to put that franchise a rest for a while.
Absolutely a blast of nostalgia. Wishing all the best for the development of these titles
Dang. That's awesome. I'm very happy to see a well known game company prioritize their classic IP's and delivering new titles for them. And the fact that they have gameplay footage suggests these titles may be close to completion. I'll be interested to see what consoles these games end up on and how they turn out. I'm most interested in Jet Set, Crazy Taxi and Golden Axe. All three looks pretty outstanding.",20,Gaming,345000,PT1M34S

ABOUT VOGUE
Vogue is the authority on fashion news, culture trends, beauty coverage, videos, celebrity style, and fashion week updates.",2844,"What an icon. People were really trying to erase this woman's impactful history and rewrite her legacy, but failed miserably. She's highly blessed.
WHY DID WE SKIP 2013-2017 she had iconic looks during those years!?!
Y’all need to bring her back and go through her 2010-2017 looks. Those are truly some of the most iconic moments in fashion, PERIOD!
This woman is iconic. No one can brake her. She is the IT girl
okay but why are we not talking about her looks between 2014- 2017? they’re the most iconic i feel like don’t ignore them 😭
this could have easily been 20 minutes. she has so many iconic looks!
She is such a natural beauty too like look at 8:03 ARE YOU SERIOUS???
"" I was feeling very elongated"" 😭
It’s nice to see Nicki overcame the hate. It was sad watching her 2018-2020 interviews and hearing the hurt in her voice but here she sounds calm, healed and better than ever
Nicki is so articulate.  No wonder she's a great wordsmith in her writing. She has a calm more relaxed aura this era, I'm loving it.
I love the way she’s speaking in this. So intelligent. So in touch with fashion and herself. I’m gagging FR over here. I don’t stan any artists besides Nicki Minaj. She has created this whole entire world, brand, and music that is so different than anything else. She really leaves me speechless
It's her and her mom having matching hairstyles for me!
How did they skip over the pinkprint era? So elegant and a turn for her.
Nicki is so iconic, a popstar, a rapper, nicki has literally done it all in the last 15 years
she has had way more iconic looks than just these few that vogue picked out
Remember thinking she always stayed in character for the cameras when she first came out..she’s really layered personality wise. Fascinating
idk why Nicki's recent videos make me so emotional. she's truly come full circle, in my lifetime, and the first artist I've ever grown alongside.
Let’s talk about how professional and gorgeous and still incorporating her personality into her vibe and mannerisms at the same time?!!
These are all iconic, but these weren’t what I was expecting. All of her super iconic looks we know her for she was heavily judged for at the time but it was so impactful and inspiring for little me to see a woman like her in fashion. Where is harajuku Barbie!?
She has so many looks, I could watch her talk about them all day! Do this a 100 times more with her!",24,Entertainment,13800000,PT9M25S

According to his son, O'Neal died peacefully on Friday. O'Neal also starred in 1973's 'Paper Moon' alongside his daughter, actress Tatum O'Neal, and the two had a tumultuous relationship in the years that followed. He's also dad to son Redmond, whom he shared with his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett. He was 82 years old.",932,"So sad . Rip Ryan. Was a great actor. Condolences to his children and grand kids .
Hopefully Tatum finally gets to heal. For most people who had toxic parents, after they die, they get to finally close that chapter and retrieve their lives. I really REALLY hope Tatum soars and is finally at peace, free from all that toxicity ♥️
I'm glad Ryan and Tatum got to take that photo together after so many years, everything came full circle after the drama in their lives, RIP Ryan.
Condolences to Ryan’s family, especially Tatum and Redmond…..

 He was a very good actor and will be missed.
Done well to reach 82yrs. RIP. We all have our struggles to deal with. No one is perfect.  Papermoon is timeless classic!
I always wished I could chat with Tatum about her dad. It's tough to have a parent that's an alcoholic and is emotionally distant from you, especially when he divorces your mother, and you feel like you've been replaced. Despite all of that, I hope in the end they were able to mend their relationship-not just for his sake but for hers as well. Carrie Fischer once quoted her famous mother saying, ""Resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die."" My wish for them both is that they forgave each other for whatever and were able to say, ""I love you."" before it was too late.
My sincerest condolences to Ryan's family and friends.  I loved him in ""Love Story"". So sad to see our childhood icons move on to another plain. Rest in peace 💔
​death comes at any time for anyone we have to be prepared, for our final hour we are immortal only the body dies the soul lives forever, I hope he finds peace.
I feel so sad for his children - My condolences for all the grieving they have gone through. ❤
I still remember sitting in the movie theater and sobbing   - along with a lot of other teenage girls in the audience.  Love Story   something about the music, film locations, and cast that  were timeless.

Condolences to Ryan’s family, especially Tatum and Redmond….. He was a very good actor and will be missed.
I would like to give my condolences to the family of Ryan O'Neal ,he was an outstanding Actor.I did not see every movie that he made but I seen a number of them.RIP Mr O'Neal.
I actually feel sorry for Tatum more than anything.
I worked on a movie with him as a crew member. He was nothing but professional wanting to do his best performance....like he wanted the glory of Love Story. I felt sorry for him on many levels noticing how hard he was on himself after a take second guessing himself and genuinely trying to give his best performance REST IN PIECE MR O NIEL
Death is always sad...sometimes a welcomed release but sad. My love goes out to his family. Rest in peace Ryan.
My heart goes out to tatum. It's hard when a parent dies and leaves things unresolved with you. Much like tatum provably felt, you wait a lifetime for that person to change because no matter what else they are they are still your latent. Sadly I know this too well
Aside from him as a father and person, I think he was a fabulous actor and he made wonderful movies. My heart goes out to poor Tatum. I hope she found some kind of closure with her father.
I always admired him as an actor. It’s a shame he wasn’t a very good father. His children really suffered because of it. I hope they can put it behind them and heal now.
He was one of the greatest actors of our time. Rest in power 
Mr O'nesl ....  and  Thank You.
Ryan was an honorable actor. His private life didn’t fit the same category. We are not perfect parents. I am so happy, the family was able to reunite, and reconcile their past “for the most part” My thoughts and prayers go out to his sons, and especially Tatum. I always worry about her. I pray to God, she is able to get some peace finally! She definitely deserves it! I also experienced a bad abusive childhood, but when my dad closed his eyes., he took all of that with him. So I really hope that she can gain just a fraction of some hope here. One thing for sure, Ryan fiercely fought the last 23 years of his life. I gotta hand it to him he’s really strong! I’m praying and thinking of you Tatum! All of your fans are! We hope you’re recuperating well from your stroke, too… 
We are all sending our thoughts and prayers out to the family at this difficult time . RIP Ryan
My Condolences to all the family and to his children. R.I.P. Ryan O'neal",24,Entertainment,6410000,PT3M24S

While it didn’t happen in a lab or on a test stand, it was absolutely a test. What we did with this second flight will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing Starship. 

The test achieved a number of major milestones, helping us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary. The team at Starbase is already working final preparations on the vehicles slated for use in Starship’s third flight test. 

Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting second flight test of Starship!

Follow us on X.com/SpaceX for continued updates on Starship's progress",2431,"We need these streams back on YouTube, I need to see this on a large display.
So great seeing all 33 Raptor engines staying lit during the entire Stage 1 ascent, excellent work!
I REALLY hope you start showing the Spacex launches on YouTube again, their are many many people who don't do social media and miss watching all the Falcon launches and updates.
Great work to all at Spacex as always.
Excited to see SpaceX making history in our lifetimes(:
I’m 67, and I remember the space program from Mercury through Apollo. They used to wheel a TV into the classrooms so we could watch…you can’t imagine how thrilled I am to see this happening! SpaceX is just running away with the ball, so happy for everyone on the project 🙌
I love this!
Please bring back live launches to YouTube, or make a smart TV app for X so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone.
This is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and co-operation, long live the entire team at SpaceX! 👏
The length of the flame plume is completely insane. Starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building, but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height, the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
It looks almost like an animation, the performance of those 33 Raptor engines was flawless 😊
It was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life. Thank you SpaceX team!
1:06 The shutdown of the engines, in a ring, from the outside to the inside!! Pure exhibitionism from Spacex!! A true spectacle!!
Inspiring, Mom always told me “shoot for the stars because you’ll land on the moon” I always think about it when I look up, Thank you guys for always pushing yourselves, it reminds me to do the same
It's amazing how close the shot at 0:53 looks to prior renders of Starship, both by SpaceX and by fans
The way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome! Well done SpaceX.
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the SpaceX team! <3
Go for it!
This gave me goosebumps! I feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future! Thankyou SpaceX ❤
Impressive epic view of liftoff. The visuals from SpaceX have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech.   Looks like SpaceX is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles!
Compared to the first test flight, this one was like night and day. Bravo, SpaceX crew! IFT 3
Это было потрясающе! Ждём с нетерпением тест 3!
The emotion of being able to watch and follow the entire preparation and launch of Starship is something spectacular, wonderful, unique, with all my heart, congratulations to everyone involved in this incredible mission, unsurpassable SpaceX...",28,Science & Technology,6600000,PT1M55S

Kieran’s new character design mixed with the music was really well done
I'm excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around Paldea, hope they're not Shiny Locked and you can finally get Shiny Sword & Shield Legendaries.
1:52 I love how when the player character sends out Iono's magnemite, she sends the pokeball the way Iono does. thats a nice detail
Everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary Pokemon, but I'm just glad we get to see more Larry!
Honestly, it feels like Teal Mask walked so that Indigo Disk could run. Looking forward to this one!
3:50 Not only am I glad Darkrai is getting the attention he deserves, but also challenging Dialga and Palkia with Darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie!
Yes!!! Blastoise’ 3D model is finally fixed. I’ve been wanting this for over 10 years. His face is sculpted proper, his cannons are the correct size, and his shell (white trim) is now sculpted properly! Ho-Oh’s new model also looks nice!
The fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
Terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries.  Not only does its lore look interesting, but we are finally getting the majestic minogame Pokemon that I’ve been wanting since Squirtle/Wartortle didn’t evolve into one!
Gen 9 isn't even over yet and I'm already nostalgic for it. And I've been a Pokemon fan since the beginning!
I’m so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool. Wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there. The music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement.
I love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders, can we have the team star members back as well, love those guys
This DLC has been amazing so far! it’s been personally heartwarming to see familiar Pokémon return and have new places to explore!
I’m so freaking happy all the starters are coming back! Can’t wait to find a Popplio!
I don’t often comment on YouTube videos….But I’m extremely excited for this one. Get to bring back some of my favourite Pokémon I collected over the years to join me in this DLC. I’m also excited for new Pokémon to catch and explore this new area. Been playing since 2006 when I was 14. Amazing that how Pokémon games have come along the way!!!
I hope that the catch rate for Legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown Paradox Entei and Paradox Terrakion
There's so much about this trailer that I'm really happy about! I am hyped, can't wait for this to come out!!!!
One thing I seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing! ❤️

And oh man, Keiran looks like he's changed quite a lot. I guess we'll have to see if there's a way to save him. But it looks like he's gone villain mode. Or maybs just angsty rival mode.

Still, it's gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again, and how the story is going to play out. I mean, getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too. Never even expected them to pull off a Dialga and Palkia Tera raid. Much less give out a Darkrai, even though you can get one in Legends Arceus, or BDSP if you managed to the Member's Card last year.

Still, all these new things are amazing. 💜

The fact that this is a whole new experience and is free, you really gotta give props to Epic and Lego for this, it’s actually insane
I honestly thought this was going to be just a fun little gimmick for Fortnite for a little while. But no, they clearly put a ton of love and effort into this. And the song choice was perfect for the trailer - made me nostalgic for the days I used to play with LEGOs as a kid.
Not a huge Fortnite fan, but the devs really put a lot of love and care into their updates. Wish other developers were the same.
Might be the best crossover so far
I love that this feels like a callback to the original design of fortnite being a horror survival by night and material base builder by day
I really hope that this is a permanent mode that gets more updates and love from the devs, this looks amazing!
This is legit what LEGO Worlds should have been!
This is pretty epic ngl. The effort and care they put into this is really outstanding!
This is what we needed. We needed a free roam no story Lego game. I’m super hyped to play when I get on!
I think everyone is truly underestimating the quality of this new game version. All the custom skins and animations they had to remake, and all the sounds and ideas. Truly we should thank the developers and not the ones telling them to make it. Thank you developers.
I dont think people understand how much effort this took. Honestly looks amazing.
As a massive lego and lego game fan as well as a fortnite enjoyer i gotta say. You guys knocked it outta the park and i love you for it i have been asking for a Lego survival for ages little did i know that Lego would not deliver but Epic would. Thank you for this!
I love how in the end they put ""adventure is building"". Is a great recall to ""the battle is building"" that appears during the first trailer of battle royale.
How is there zero paid content for this mode?? It's so insanely good and I was not expecting a completely new game. This was awesome!!
The fact that this is such a new experience and it's free that you actually have to give Epic and LEGO props for this is actually crazy
The music alone had me beyond hyped! 1:17 
I played it most of the day around classes and work and it was so much fun! I also got to play it with my friends this evening which just made the experience better!
After playing this mode for a few hours, it feels like a combination of LEGO Universe, Minecraft, and a touch of Fortnite. I love it
Honestly better than what I was expecting! Just spent the past 5 hours playing with my friends
Loving it so far. I'm happy this isn't a one off, but will continue to be developed over time.",22,People & Blogs,216000,PT2M3S

All the brawlers sound fun as hell. Though I'm surprised the 3rd brawler is for the rt trio and not the castle court yard
Which brawler are you MOST excited for!?
SUBSCRIBE for update sneak peeks!
For Larry and Lawry I wish we could switch playing between them as long as both are alive. Also it would've been cool if we could choose with which one we start the match (this will also be the one that respawns during the match).
Kairos turns a 10 minutes Brawl Talk into a 20 minutes analysis and I wouldn’t want it any other way! 30 minutes of my Saturday well spent!
Watching Kairos after Brawl talk is compulsory 😊
3:33 It's not that the healing is inconsistent; Kit heals a flat percentage of the brawler's max hp every second.  The ""inconsistency"" is Meg's natural health regeneration.
I feel like one of the L Duo's gadgets will let us change to the other L, meaning we will be able to play as Larry (? the evil/bad one).
I think a better idea for Larry and Laury is that their super would make them switch out so you can have a different attack power!😊
Wasn’t sandy once classified as support?

UPDATE: it’s true. On the wiki it shows us that on 01/23/2020 Sandy was changed from a fighter to support. He was later reclassified again to controller, so kitt isn’t the FIRST legendary support, just the only current one.
Just a quick fix, there is a frame in the brawl talk where you can see mortis's gear speeds up bats by 50%. Great video Kairos!
It would be cool if for Larry and Lawrie you are able to change perspectives using maybe a gadget of some sorts.
I like having some sort of stage hazards like the ice. We haven’t had that since the minecarts and it adds some good variety
If they add hot zone 5v5, I hope, they add a contested mechanic, because having 10 people constantly coming to the zone will be more of a ""who reaches the zone first wins"" than capture and defend the zone

Also the cartoon trio skins is a wierd trio:
Anime cat maid Colette
""Cuphead"" Rico
And ""power puff girls"" Spike with mickey mouse pants
I think it would be fun if we had the choice to switch between Laury and Lawry. Just like how eve can switch her attack pattern by equiping star power. So it would be cool if we had the sp.
You can see how when Edgar activates his hypercharge, he doesn't get the reload buff. Only when he jumps with his super he starts having the red effect (sign of a reload speed buff like Bull's 1st star power and Meg's 2nd gadget)
It would be fun if it would be chosen randomly if you play Larry or Lawrie after respawn or joining a match 😀
Micos first star power allows him to instantly reload a shot when the bar is full
This is what brawl stars needs, this update seems so polished and like a whole new fresh experience I can’t wait for 5v5
I said it once and I’m going to say it again Kairos is the man for giving us the info we need after the brawl talk. Man I love Kairos best brawl stars YouTuber",20,Gaming,1050000,PT19M55S

LYRICS 
Welcome to my problems
It’s not an invitation
This is my dilemma
And it’s my obsession

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

Welcome to my nightmare
Where dreams go to disappear
Sit around in rehab
Feeling like a lab rat

Strange days are here again
And it’s getting weirder
Here’s to all my problems
I just want to drink the poison

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

Oh, why
When I fall asleep tonight
On the wing
and prayer
Oh, why
For despair and obsession on you
You, yeah

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

#GreenDay #Saviors #Dilemma",3473,"This song is so personal and from the heart. We are all proud of you Billie!
We just announced a MASSIVE tour 🌏 All the details you need for The Saviors Tour are on greenday.com/tour

New album ‘Saviors' out January 19th, 2024, pre-order it now https://greenday.lnk.to/saviors
This album feels like you just found an old Green Day song you never listened to and you're listening to it for the first time.
I’m proud of you, man. You were a father figure to me and did a lot for me when I was a kid, even if you didn’t know it. Your music saved my life. I’m glad you’re still breathing and were able to overcome the difficulties that you faced — much love, Billie!
Most authentic Green Day in a long while, this is a fantastic return
This is BY FAR my favorite single from this album so far. Feels like a return to form and I'm all here for it. Siked for the drop!
""Welcome to my nightmare, where dreams go to disappear"" 

Green Day still hits hard.
How do I explain this? THIS song feels like that one Green Day song I've been wanting so badly. The Pre-American Idiot song, that sounds like their old stuff, but new. American Idiot is amazing, and loved everything after that. But I've been missing the old sound, and this is mixed with new sound too. They nailed it.

I also hear a little Longshot in this too!
The best song they’ve released in at least 10 years
Absolutely phenomenal. Love the sound of every aspect of this song, instrumental and vocal. So on point! Excited for the rest of this album 🤤
This is probably one of my favorite music videos from them, it’s so simple but gets the message across
Thank you, Green Day. You guys and your music, are so dear to my heart. I am having some struggles with substance abuse- more specifically alcohol. You've inspired me Billie, to create a New Years resolution of quitting drinking, before it wrecks me. It won't be easy to keep it up. Next month, I'll be 27. I have Bipolar Disorder, and this is no way to heal. I appreciate you all so much.
Green Day and drop D tuning! Something I never thought I’d see but they’ve done it and I FUCKING LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
This band is amazing! 💚
No joke. This has to be the best song they’ve released since anything on American Idiot.

Mature themes. Gritty and powerful. Great lyrics, great melody and a very catchy chorus.

Gosh I love Green Day so much. Absolute banger! 💖
The more you listen to this song. The more you get into it.
This truly hits me. Fuck man. I lost the one I thought was going to be by my side forever.
man the new album is gonna be amazing <3
My mom recently passed away and on the same month they released their first songs from their new album. They have helped me a lot, but this song hits different. Being in a dark place and having some weird thoughts and Green Day shining a bright light on me through this song is what I needed. 😢❤ Thank you for a second chance.

How did David not know that Malik was fruity? I was thinking it the whole time, but I was like, 'I guess maybe he's bi' haha
Emily is me wearing the mask upside down lol 😂
The “moan, don’t stop” then everyones reaction had me dying 😂
They need to have johnnie guilbert and zach justice on one of these dating things because that combo will be hilarious!
Johnnie throwing his hands up in defeat when she says she likes deep voices and tall guys 😂
i can't believe she eliminated johnnie even tho his ear thing was clearly a joke meanwhile she kept the dude who made her feel his NOSE and was deadass serious about it 😭
Johnnie everytime looking so out of place, I love it 😭 He’s adorable
I’m so happy Johnnie is getting into more stuff like this!
We need to get Johnnie a date. He is always so sweet and wholesome.
We need a blind date episode specifically for johnnie because he deserves it
Johnnie's literally so funny, the best option, but he's always getting eliminated early.
Petition to have johnnie on here each episode until he gets chosen

That’s the biggest plot twist of all time. Was expecting a survival game but we were given a whole dumpster surprise
We are not surprised. The developers are laughing all the way to the bank for every single person that spent $40 for this.
The fact this game was the most wishlisted game on steam is insane
I was pretty much expecting it to be this bad. What kind of bothers me is how they marketed the game. In one trailer, they scripted it as to make it seem like the two players are speaking to each other using VOIP. Their usernames highlight when speaking and everything. Features like that get shown in trailers and then end up being non existent in the game. It's no wonder they deleted the old trailers from their channel. IGN kept them uploaded though.
The fact that people had such low expectations for this and it still managed to do even worse is incredible.
Well done everyone for feeding this type of scams.
The Day Before is a perfect example to never, ever, under any circumstances, trust a trailer or pre order anything before a full release
They didn't disappoint, it's exactly what I expected
I wasn't waiting for this game, I was waiting for this video.
Hey. Pick up some Merch maybe? https://bigfryshop.com - Thanks for the amazing day!
Just so be clear: The entire city map (which is not even open world) is a Unreal Engine store asser you can get for $539
Hopefully other devs see what these devs promised, showed in trailers, and can make the original idea into a reality.
The alarms use so many resources, that zombies cannot spawn in. Maybe if they reduce the amount of alarms from 1000 to 10 they could add 5 more zombies. Wow, what a SAD game.
5:17 i'm legit crying tears of laughter. Great work on this man I know you were on this literally since the day before day one and love to see it come full circle. I don't know if the Day befores saga is finally over but always enjoy your takes on it.
I had a great time watching your stream today. Thanks for taking one for the team so I didn't have to waste my money on absolute garbage.
Watched your live stream while caring for my daughter. Thanks for the laughs. The absolute shame of this and other games they rely on our hope for something amazing. And sucker people in. This game deff solid bet on train wreck. Hence the sales it got no one wanted to miss out. Like watching a fight at school.
Something that promised so much and ended up being completely different can definitely be fit into a class action lawsuit. Especially this
The moment when the character running for hours and looking into sky and said "" So this is what a day before feels like, this is the day before that i always looking for""  Put tears in my eye.
I'll never forget how blown away I was the first time I saw the trailer. I just can't believe things turned out this way.
We all knew this was going to happen, what's upsetting is that I wanted it to be good so that I could have a fun coop shooter with the squad because we don't really have many games like that we aren't sick of. My next hope of ""things that could be cool but probably will be really bad"" is Ubisoft's Skull and Bones. It can't be that hard to make good games that people can play with their friends.",20,Gaming,328000,PT10M28S

This looks INSANE!
I never expected LEGO and Fortnite to come together, but this cinematic trailer was a masterpiece!!
Actions speak louder than words. No dialogues, pure LEGO greatness.
This looks sooo dope! I can't wait to play!
At first I was disappointed that everything wasn’t out of Lego’s but now I actually think real environments mixed with Lego might actually work better imo!!!
This honestly looks like if save the world didnt go for a zombie approach and just went full survival, and im all for it
Now imagine being a kid and seeing this…
Prime childhood moment right there!!
If this was a real show I’d watch every episode of it!!!!! The animation team is absolutely killing it
I can't believe how good this looks 🔥
I wasn’t sure how to feel about this when it was first announced but DAMN I’m hyped now it actually looks like possibly one of the best LEGO games ever
Whether u love Fortnite or hate it, u can’t deny the creativity and talent this team puts together to make incredible content!!
Wow.😮 CRAZY LEGO GAME 🎮🔥
This looks and sounds really fun
Within a couple of years i can already imagine the nostalgia everyone is gonna have about this mode
This looks and sounds really fun. I recently played the new LEGO Star Wars and fell in love with the open world, so I’m excited to see what this is like!
Now this is EPIC!
This has been so fun and exciting. Truly a nice refreshing experience. I, glad it’s doing extremely well because we all see the work you all put into this.
I want to express my gratitude to Fortnite for all of the work that goes into making their game so fantastic.
this genuinely looks good, i believe if this goes through well and epic doesnt mess this up it will be a big hit.",22,People & Blogs,216000,PT2M38S

GUILTY GEAR : the next entry to the series

■GUILTY GEAR Official X
https://twitter.com/GUILTYGEAR_PR

■The fate of the universe will be determined...
The story of Guilty Gear, spanning over 20 years, will finally come to a conclusion in “GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-."" The trials and tribulations of the series’ heroes and villains will finally be resolved. Discover the astonishing truth awaiting at the end of all things.

Check out the play style of the second character in Season Pass 3, Elphelt, in this trailer.

© ARC SYSTEM WORKS",1055,"“A new elphelt full of rock, death, metal and love” now that’s quite the sentence
Her being death metal vocalist makes so much sense considering her lore. Love it.
Im really glad they got cassandra lee morris to come back, i liked her voice in sign.
Elphelt went from ""innocence"" to ""Gotta kill 'em all!"". God I love Guilty Gear
My immense hate for elphelt immediately dissipates upon hearing that theme song, she's the best character now
I adore the new dimensions they've added to her design and personality with this.
They made her a metalhead and i love it! Can’t wait to main her
They changed her whole style, and Not gonna Lie, I LOVED IT. She looks hella awesome. And SHE DROPS TODAY????? GREAT STUFF
The transition from monologue into growling was freakin iconic!! I jumped out of my chair when I heard this live
A character reveal so good we all put aside our zoner hate for one video.
I wanna see Elphelt compete against I-no’s and decide who can pull off the best musical performance.
From a desperate romantic to a hard-core rockstar and I love it
I think everyone in the Elphelt Nation miss the rabbit ears she had 🥺 I wish that was incorporated somewhere in her design
I honestly really love this direction. It’s genuinely a whole new elphelt. same character but her identity is oh so different. I guess that makes sense though, cause like ram, her story was also about identity. but anyway its just really cool and i’m glad they’re expanding her character. She’s already a lot more interesting than she was originally to me. not to say i didnt like her before !! ahhhhh !!!

Also no shade to naoki but its really cool that they’re introducing new singers onto the tracks, his vocals were sometimes hard to decipher, especially in “the circle”. I still to this day have not seen a fully accurate interpretation of the lyrics to that song. Even spotify has the wrong lyrics 😭

but i mean its also just cool because of more variety
Glad to see Elphelt come back. She may not be A.B.A, but shes still pretty great. Love the direction they went with her. Who knew sleeper agents could be such great metalheads?
So, if I remember Elphet’s backstory, she was engaged to a rock musician at one point right? Didn’t she get her power and the memories warning her about Ram pretty much at the altar. It’s why her original costume looked like a wedding dress, it literally was her wedding dress that she never got the chance to use. What exactly happened to her fiancé again? Because a lot of her dialogue in previous games, and that one line in this trailer, seems to indicate she is still looking for a serious romantic relationship. Did her fiancé just never exist and those were fake memories she was given by the universal will as part of a cover story, did she come to the conclusion she didn’t love her spouse to be anymore if they were real, or did her fiancé get killed off screen during the events of XRD? Or I suppose the writers could have just forgotten about that character, they were literally so inconsequential they never came up or were given a name, so I suppose that’d be fine, just seems a little odd.
Making Elphelt a metal vocalist while also staying true to her lovey-dovey, pastel self was one of the best directions they could have taken her character in. Never doubt Daisuke's vision.
Looks like Elphelt's taking some inspiration from Sol with her new weapon. The fact it acts as a microphone stand makes the Freddy Mercury reference more significant
I won't lie, when the Render was leaked I was really disappointed, but now seeing her in-game makes me happy and she looks really cool :]
Very excited for her. Elphelt has been my most anticipated character for Strive.",20,Gaming,234000,PT1M31S

#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",776,"This is a certified “I Tried 100% Speedrunning Cuphead” moment.
To think that the Devs had to sell their own house at one point to finish the game.
The game flopping would have been terrifying.
This man has professionalism in 70% of the entirety of video games.
37:10 It's surprising how few people know that the parry hitboxes for King Dice's cards are extended upward if you are playing as Chalice. However, the fight against Hopus Pocus (the rabbit) is almost impossible to complete without taking damage, so Cuphead is still optimal for this level.
The fact that he called Cagney flowey without acknowledging it is too funny
""Here she turns into a sausage and tries to attack us with her swirling meat attacks  while we also have to deal with a bunch of dangling meats""💀💀💀
How did you get past the first level so fast? I saw a professional video game journalist spend 25 minutes on it because of its difficulty.
While I have 300% the game, I'm definitely not mad enough to try speed running it yet. Respect.
There are several reasons I'm terrible at Cuphead, but one of them is that I get distracted wanting to watch the brilliant animations
If you play the circus run and gun level, you van dodge roll through the stack of minions if u stand on the top platform. Just roll, jump and dash to the next platform. That you you dont have to shoot them and safe time! 
It also works on the cannons at the end at that section.
this game is just amazing for many reasons and i would love to see it more on this channel
The divine relic is actually perfect for the devil. On his second phase, you can spam your whetstone to deal a ton of damage and kill him insanely quickly
Cuphead is so unique in like every aspect I love it
Even though I have S ranked every boss in the game, I will definitely not speedrun the game like you, mad respect there were even things I didn't know you showed in your speedrun like Mortimer freeze's final phase has no hitbox damn.
I never knew that not attacking the onion was a viable option
for those who don't know: if u leave the dogs alive but damage their jetpacks (when the jetpacks spray gray smoke instead of white smoke) then the fight becomes slightly easier because the robot dog won't flip the screen upside down
I'm so sad that speed runs take so long to do because I could watch your videos every day all the time 😊 they're so good
This is the most beautiful game ever made and I don't see it getting beaten any time soon. I'll take a unique and amazingly creative artstyle like this over photorealistic graphics any day.
This is easily top 3 favourite games of all time such a unique game and every level is a boss apart from run n guns absolutely love it
For ribby & croaks you can use converge because it pierces through hitboxes so you can do double damage to them",20,Gaming,2750000,PT38M41S

LYRICS / LETRA


Salí a mirar la luna pero terminé mirando tus fotos.
Flaca siéndote sincero yo te pienso aunque lo nuestro este roto. [Oh]
La culpa no fue tuya pero mía tampoco.
Y tal vez parezca loco pero dime tú si es que me equivoco.

Fue la culpa de la rutina,
de que lo nuestro se jodiera.
Yo tuve que soltarte aunque eso me doliera.
Con los culos maté la tusa pero tú sabes que no cualquiera
Va a llenar el vacío que dejaste
y me lo va a hacer de la misma manera.

Salí a mirar la luna pero terminé mirando tus fotos.
Flaca siéndote sincero yo te pienso aunque lo nuestro este roto. [Oh]
La culpa no fue tuya pero mía tampoco.
Y tal vez parezca loco pero dime tú si es que me equivoco.

Fue la culpa de la rutina,
de que lo nuestro se jodiera. Yo
Tuve que soltarte aunque eso me doliera.
Con los culos maté la tusa pero tú sabes que no cualquiera
Va a llenar el vacío que dejaste
y me lo va a hacer de la misma manera.

Si me quedo en el lugar es para que hagamos el amor
El verano se hizo invierno y yo que soy fan del calor
La película que tú y yo tenemos, la pusiste en blanco y negro y a mí que me gusta el color
Los llantos nos resfriaron, ya no sientes mi olor.
Nos preocupamos por las cosas que tenemos alrededor
Y es loco porque parece un chiste,
Te desearía lo mejor pero ya me tuviste.

Mami, fuiste esa historia que yo deslicé
Eso que estaba por tuitear pero que al final borré
Tantas fotos nos tomamos que nunca publiqué
La razón por la que he vuelto darle play a Te Boté

Mami, fuiste esa historia que yo deslicé

Fue la culpa de la rutina,
de que lo nuestro se jodiera.

Go on an emotional journey and walk the delicate line between life and death in this special Persona 3 Reload trailer for #TheGameAwards

Persona 3 Reload releases February 2, 2024. Pre-order your copy today! https://atlus.link/3qL1zZ5",846,"The new music sounds so good!!!! (it seems to be the new opening called full moon full life), the animation quality is beautiful, the gameplay and the visuals of the world look so amazing and the voices of the characters and the social links sound great as well!!!!!
This game looks so incredible. This will definitely be the best way to experience Persona 3🙏
THE MEANING OF LIFE
So bold, Atlus, so bold. Never thought you'd be this direct when marketing this game.
Every trailer just gets me more hyped for this game
""I think I was able to start living because of the time I spent with my friends.""
- Makoto Yuki, _Persona 3: Winter of Rebirth_

Edit: To me, he'll always be Minato Arisato ☝️
Really looking forward to doing Akinari's social link again. His social link was the most meaningful and important social link in the entire game.
😢C'mon, bro, I almost teared up at Junpei's voice line. Zeno really about to make me cry
Every new teaser keeps getting me more and more excited for this game to drop, the animation is just incredible and beautiful I can’t wait 😭‼️‼️
Aleks Le absolutely killed it with that gut-wrenching scream at 1:06, it really does sound like how getting your psyche physically ripped apart would probably feel 😁 rly excited to see his performance as a couple other characters too he's such a talented VA!!!
Is this the opening theme?! Man, the Reload originals just don’t miss! That second half feels straight up like a battle theme!
Bebe sounds way more badass than I expected him to. Loving all the social link voices, so great to finally hear them. Even Kenji seems more likable just from his voice acting.
My life has meaning once again when you remake the game. Thank you Team Atlus!
That amazing song with all those shots of the crew and Akinari talking about the meaning of life actually made me tear up. Well played, Atlus.
Already more than excited to Play Reload and if the song used in this trailer is in it's opening that'll be amazing. Also love the fact Lucien Dodge is Akinari dude's a fantastic voice actor so it great he gets to voice my favorite social link from the original P3.
THE OPENING SONG IS A BANGER MAN
All the social links feel even more alive, Junpei and Akinari’s lines are beautifully done and the armageddon fusion spell at the end… man this 2024 is looking like a great year for gaming
I just realized that every character being voiced means the Sun confidant is included
1:22 made me instantly tear up
I'm so glad every persona soundtrack comes with a game inside.
That one line from Zeno as Junpei has fully cemented that he has what it takes. 

Junpei has this strange gentleness in his voice that I was afraid was going to get lost in the wackiness. But no, he definitely hit a ""home run"".
1:06 and 1:17 really gave me goosebumps. Phenomenal voice acting from Aleks Lee and Zeno Robinson!
Man persona 3 is my favourite, so glad they are making this. I hope with the new graphics people will come to love this game as much as I do",20,Gaming,216000,PT2M1S

Lyrics:

Baby, estoy activa
Ando con mi amiga y..
Ella está loca por probarte
Y.. yo quiero repetir
No te asustes

Esos gritos marcan mis memorias
Tienes de highlight en IG los lugares que te lo meti
Pa darte de nuevo y repetir ya me compre un DeLorean
Chingamos y lo hacemos parte de la historia
Contigo encima mirandome esa carita angelical ya me siento llegando a la Gloria
Te ves mas hackea desde que te hiciste el body kit
Dime si en esas nalgas firmo el split
Que yo quiero el porciento One Hundred de ti
Me tiene enchulao tu cara eh bellakiita
y ese olor a fresita
En el cielo te agarro , te aprieto , te beso, te muerdo ,te escupo la boca y me gritas

Coro: 

UuU UuU
Esta bellakera y el culo que ella tiene
Ya ‘tamo ready pal versus
Siempre se le pega mi olor
Cada vez que se monta en la Lexus
Eso la chotea, abajo le gotea
Si el jevo frontea lo mando con Jesús
Lo dejo a cinco grados celsius

UuU! UuU!!
Cuando estoy trancao' en el estu
Los polvo' que echamo' son de triple doble a lo Westbrook
La nota nos tiene flotando
Veinte mil pies de altitud
Voltea los ojos como el Undertaker
Cuando entierro el muerto sin ataúd

Yo le dije que tú quieres pídelo que te complazco
Y ahora quiere que se la eche dentro ‘el frasco
Yo no fallo mami, voy a serte franco
Si te preño te mantengo con lo blanco
Oye baby cuánto quieres?? toma
Cuando me chambea la pieza ella sabe que se detona
Que ironía tas feliz porque ese totito le llora
Siempre me grita ""UuU” si me escucha en el remix de ROA
Dame tag y te reposteo

Campeona ven agarra tu trofeo
Tiene jevo, el cabron es hasta feo
Y si algún día se entera que estuvimo', avísale que no boxeo
Que lo mío son las rápidas
Y que la movie de él no se la creo
Dale, tócate por Facetime vamo a empezar el bellakeo
Que yo soy tu ejecutivo
De contact me tiene “CEO”
Voy penetrando tu zona
Me pone un topping en la punta y lo decora
Oye bebé, decora
Si te quedas te llevo pa' Bora Bora
Dice que se vuelve loca si me escucha en la emisora
Un pinta labios que se lo compré en Sephora
Esa baby es sencilla, se conforma con Pandora
Y le compré un AP pa' que le brille más la hora
Eso e' Audemars Piguet
Llama a un pal de amigas vamos a cuadrar un get
Ese culo a mi me puso bellako y se lo apliqué
No soy tu príncipe azul, yo las cambio como Piqué
Yo soy un player en el prime
Tú solo invita mami, que yo estoy online
Le llego con la Z y con una botella 'e wine
Y el polvo repetimos siempre le damos rewind

Le doy por la baldo a medio chambón
Yo me lo saco ella sola cantó
Una pobre diabla, yo The Last Don
Llamando por FaceTime la amiga..
¿Quién sabe? Quizás se la ponga a las dos
Un chin en el belly, un chin en el peli
Le digo, ""Bebé, dime dónde faltó?”
Los senos recién operao'
La muerdo y le dejo una marca como el 700 haciendo burnout
Pa' la disco seguro salía
Pero preferimo' quedarno' encerrauw
El cabrón de tu jevo te escribe rochao' ao-ao-ao
Y yo aprovechao', -ao'-ao'-ao'

(Coro)

Cuando ella se trepa en el tubo y me baila me hace el 3 6 0 como carter vince
Venirse era un sueño y yo soy Freddy Krueger cuando la mato dentro el dream
BABY
Me siento lento no se si es el veneno en tus labios o lean
La llevo pal west sin las Kanye chinga como kardashian porque es Kim
BO
Cuando estoy adentro me fabrica un caso porque la tengo cumpliendo una condena
Sus piernas en mi cuello es un cierre en diamantes se lo meto y me agarra por las cadenas
Tiene el alma fría aunque la eleve al cielo le gusta el pecado y su cuerpo se quema
Ya salió el 66 en compañía del Lobo traite una amiguita que hoy hay luna llena
Me pego a su piel como fragancia
Ella ta en declive como torre e’ Francia
Se da deo si estamos a distancia
La choco y termina en ambulancia
Sentimiento Maldad y Elegancia
Le gusta mi arrogancia
Porque en el culo no le invertí un peso pero tengo el toto de ganancia
Que tú quieres baby que te coma toa’?
Que te baje el panty como rollin door ?
Te lo hago en el baño, en la cama o el floor
Toi 2 a 0 arriba en el score
En el infierno soy tu baby goat
Ella es una serpiente como las boa
Gane un Disco ‘e Oro con el primer verso atetentamente el 66 con ROA

Congrats on reaching the finish line with this one. It looks great.
can't wait to see the FINALE to the P1 as well
Can’t wait to see this on the road once I’m back! Sounds amazing 😻
Doing a 6-speed gated manual conversion in a Scuderia is so sick 🔥
Amazing build! You and Matt Armstrong are my go to channels for rebuilds.
EAG is an EPIC company. The things they do with these conversions is amazing!!  And how fast he gets it done, unreal.
My heart skipped a beat listening to that engine sound, such a beautiful piece of engineering!
Freddy, watching you work on cars is such a joy! You can tell you’re having fun, and those of us watching really feel the same just like we were there in the garage with you. Keep up the great work, man! Kudos!
Freddie, you make a two year work look like a two week work with your simplicity. No stress at all in this two year build, you're always a delight to watch
So classy in white! I was sceptical about that manual conversion, but it works great. 
Congratulations on another top shelf build. Have to say, it’s awesome to see that no matter how big and successful your channel has become, you’re still the same guy, humble and just generally a good human being. Love the channel, you deserve every bit of success you get.
yeaah!!! Finally this video comes out! Been seeing the car in the background over the past two years in your videos slowly being put together! There's some videos in the past two years that occasionally shows Jack working on it too, and I've always wondered when a video on this car would come out! finally!! haha Just WELL DONE!
Awesome job Freddy, looks amazing. Love the centre locks and manual shift .... literally the best Scuderia in the world.
Such a satisfying video to watch, Freddy. Your content is always phenomenal and inspiring. Keep up the fantastic work buddy.
Dear Freddy, thank you so much for sharing this and all of them crazy builds you do 

It encourages me to think I can challenge myself, I can do it. 

Keep it up!
I absolutely love the F430 Scuderia. What a great job getting this one done with a gated manual and some nice touches with the race car parts. Awesome as always.
This is epic, you're a legend Freddy.  I don't even want Christmas lights, but I'll buy some if you just keep making stuff like this
I can only imagine how much it takes to do what you do,you’re an inspiration.Keep on wrenching every day 🔧
The Ferrari sounds amazing.  You have achieved and rebuilt an absolute supercar. It has been amazing following this build with you. Well done and thank you
So happy for you. It’s not about being the fastest, it’s about the experience, and this car is an experience without a doubt.",2,Autos & Vehicles,2750000,PT30M26S

Just over one month later, the devastating loss of Ken Block meant that the project was shelved - until now.

Block, The Hoonigans, and Audi continue pushing the limits of what’s possible in the performance EV world with Electrikhana TWO, sliding through iconic areas of Mexico City in Block’s infamously aggressive, rally-inspired driving style. Improving the car immediately after the first film, Block and Audi built on important development lessons from their experience in Las Vegas.

A BIG thank you goes out to the partners who helped make Electrikhana TWO possible:

Thank you Ken and everyone at Hoonigan for all the inspiration! Rest in peace legend. ❤ #kb43ver
Changed the game forever. Thank you for everything, Ken + thank you, Hoonigan for sharing the final KB43 chapter 💙
4:21 Dude closed his eyes like he was about to crash then does a badass 180 drift transiton. What a legend!
It’s almost been a year without him now. Still can’t believe he’s gone. Amazing video and amazing driving as always. Rest easy Mr. Block
I dont know whats more impressive, ken's driving or the fact that they managed to get a whole airport to play around in. The credits were... Miss you and thank you for everything Ken and the hoonigan family.
かっこいい。。。号泣しながら見た。最期の総集編なんかえづきながら見た。
全部リアタイで見てきたことを自慢したいわけじゃなく、この人と同じ時代を生きれたことに心から感謝してる。
Rest In Peace, Legend.
I never forgot the first Gymkhana came out. Since then been waiting for every Gymkhana to come out. What a legendary driver. You’re already missed by lot of us Ken. You’re gone but not forgotten legendary one. #KB43VER 💪🏾
Es un honor que allá venido a México una super leyenda GRACIAS 🎉❤
Thank you Ken and Hoonigan team for everything you've done. This last permormance was hard to watch without tearing up. This National Treasure did so much for the sport and entire community, dare I say, world. Block family, I wish there were more I could do besides say I'm sorry for your loss. I only know Ken from a fan stand point but he seemed like one of the greatest people to be able to know. May his legacy and spirit live on. Rip Ken Block #KB43ver
Thank you Hoonigan team. It's been the right amount of time to release this as a great tribute and send-off. I'll be interested to see where Hoonigan goes in the future. and of course rest in peace Ken.
El verdadero DK! Un orgullo que haya estado en tierras mexicanas, descansa en paz leyenda.
The pure skill that Ken had was unmatched. Loss of a great driver, great man, great role model and great father. Rest in peace.
I think I speak for everyone when I say this, I thought there wouldn’t be any more videos of Ken. Almost made me cry seeing this. Thank you HOONIGAN for sharing Ken having one last badass shred. RIP43 forever a legend.
Over 4 million views in just a few days, wow. That says enough about the respect this man has. He notched out his own place in the world & it will be his forever
What an amazing send off to Ken's Gymkhana series.... He is working up there now, creating the real clouds just like he used to do down here with his videos. Eager to see Lia shred the next Gymkhana, that'll be emotional.
Hard to believe I've been watching these since I was a kid. Ken was an absolute legend. Thank you Brian and team for giving us one more
man, i don't think anyone will ever match the sheer talent and precision that ken block had, he literally had to be perfect for all his stunts, love u ken block and miss you like crazy man u are a legend.
Not gonna lie, this brings tears to my eyes. Just like watching his daughter the other day on the Audi Rally video. Tears of pure sadness and pain. Thank you Ken Block. I'll still always remember meeting you and Travis in Maryland all those years ago.",2,Autos & Vehicles,5660000,PT11M37S

Settled, thank you. I’ve been watching your content abroad since leaving the states for the last few years and these 3 series have been the only thing that gives me a sense of home. I cannot thank you enough for the effort you put in and the crazy hours you put in. Just know the effort you put into the videos is truly unmatched and it does not go unrecognized. It brings people joy in ways you’d never know.
I loved hearing settled say he was so thirsty for a big crazy challenge after tileman. Very inspiring especially after hearing your emotional reactions In the finale and now hearing about the behind the scenes stress.
just rewatched the finale and Settled you truly make some of the best videos on the platform and I mean that wholeheartedly. You tap into every emotion in your videos and it's such a rollercoaster every time, Swampletics and Mctile with stay with me forever as some of my favorite series on all of Youtube. Love YOU and your content Settled :)
Thank you for the years of content. You single-handedly got me back into RuneScape, I haven't played since OS but since Swampletics you've introduced me to a world of content and so many different creators. Enjoy your break, it's well deserved!
This series was epic man. It's cool to watch you set these crazy goals and accomplish them. Can't wait to see what's next!

i just want to thank you for keeping entertained with such an amazing series and also introducing me to a new favorite band! Dont push yourself too hard on this next one. Things have been hard these last few years but your content has helped me so much
I have binge watched this series without ever really spending more than 30 minutes ever playing Runescape and what a journey. Congratulations on this HUGE achievement and thank you for your dedication to see it through! I can't wait to see what you bring next!
Genuinely loved this series man, thank you for creating this work of art for us
You’re such a great role model in what someone can accomplish with perserverance and commitment. I almost gave up on RuneScape as my favorite past time and you helped me find fun again!
Much love, brother! Thanks for all of the amazing work. I'm excited to see what the future holds. <3
Thank you for entertaining us, I always listened to the episodes while grinding, sometimes getting inspiration towards my next goal
I have to say again that this series was so amazing and I always looked forward to a new episode. And to add, that finale was so incredibly beautiful. It is now a standard on your final episode for a series
I see many of us watchers were going through some heavy shit going on in our lives. I'm so thankful we all had this this series to have a break from real life stuff. 
Thanks Settled man. You are awesome and really an artist.

It's not a audio it's a addiction ❤️✨
Who loved Bobby in abrar's role❤
Those who went for the movie they only know how this scene is iconic
I am Iranian and I also enjoy Indian songs very much. I believe that our mutual love for each other's songs is not a coincidence, as there are many similarities and shared values in Indian and Iranian culture and language.
It might be the first time in any movie history that viewers enjoyed the entry of a villian more than a hero 🇮🇷💓🇮🇳
As a native Persian ( Farsi ) speaker , I can't describe my feeling of joy after seeing bobby's entry with this song...!

As an Iranian(Persian), i'm really happy this song appeard on the Bollywood! 
I remember this song as a child in every Iranian wedding I have attended. Glad to see it hits in a dance loving culture such as India.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga's music selection is truly praiseworthy, seamlessly weaving emotions into his films through a captivating blend of melodies. Each song is a testament to his excellent taste and ability to enhance storytelling through music.

There are lots of cool new things to pick out from this brand new Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and in our GTA 6 trailer deep dive, we examine clues about GTA 6 map locations, hints about the GTA 6 world, glimpses of what might happen in the GTA 6 story, references to GTA Vice City, and more.

The GTA 6 release date is 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

It will be great to see more densely packed cities. GTA 5 definitely does feel empty sometimes especially in places where it will normally be crowded
Wow, this breakdown is spot on and detailed. Kudos to folks from IGN team who researched every single bit!
It's crazy that even as adults this still make us feel like kids again 😳
Surprisingly this trailer has given so many people a reason to be happy and stay hopeful. This is what the world needs. Love Rockstar and thank you IGN for a meticulous break down of that beautiful trailer.
This is a crazy breakdown. It emphasizes just how much care was put into the video and game assets in a way that I'd never appreciate watching the video without this breakdown.
Hats off to IGN for doing the heavy lifting with this level of meticulous research. These trailer breakdowns reveal so much about a game.
Maybe the ancle monitor is a creative way to limit the players explorable area in the beginning like Rockstar did in previous GTA games. If so this would be incredible creative 😊
Credit to tachyon_v for the fan map creation
I’ve watched like 5 or 6 of these trailer breakdowns and this is BY FAR the best one! Thanks to the folks at IGN for putting in the time and effort to provide alot of fun context to the background elements that others missed! ️
It will be great to see more densely packed cities.
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
""Thrilled to finally share a glimpse of the incredible world we've been crafting in GTA VI. Can't wait for players to experience the next level of immersive storytelling and gameplay. Stay tuned for more excitement ahead!""
Making a game like this requires recreating a culture from real life very accurately, but also adding just enough exaggeration to make it exciting, interesting, and fun for the player. Striking that balance between accuracy and excitement factor has got to feel impossible, but somehow Rockstar does it perfectly every time. It’s amazing
The attention to detail is stunning and mind blowing.
Wow Rockstar you guys did it
Crazy how far the grand thief auto series has come, i’v played every single one and they continue to blow our minds
The amount of detail they packed into just the first trailer and into the Vice City world has me so hyped.
Well done on all the details spotted - it's amazing how much details one can pick out from just a trailer. One can only imagine how many more we will find in future trailers and in-game too.

Just a note - the song ""Running Down A Dream"" was featured in San Andreas, not Vice City
Great video and what an incredible amount of detail and care that went into creating the trailer. There is only one Rockstar. 🔥

Im glad to see Google back in the game, this looks next level.
Very impressive. Want to try it.
FYI this is embellished a bit. It's still extremely cool and impressive (and I am SO excited to see these advances!), but there's a fair amount they have to do to get to this exact state. ""In a viral video demonstrating Gemini’s capabilities, Google took significant artistic license. It showed a user speaking with Gemini, but was actually representing a text conversation. It showed a moving video, but was feeding Gemini still images. It showed fast responses, but sped those up. It showed tight model outputs, but shortened them “for brevity.” It showed brief prompts eliciting terrific answers, but listed longer prompts in a blog post."" - from Big Technlology by Alex Kantrowitz
The real-time element is by far the most impressive. These sorts of asynchronous interactions are what AI has been missing thus far.
Just one problem: the video isn’t real. “We created the demo by capturing footage in order to test Gemini’s capabilities on a wide range of challenges. Then we prompted Gemini using still image frames from the footage, and prompting via text.” (Parmy Olsen at Bloomberg was the first to report the discrepancy.)
That is incredibly impressive. There were clearly some hidden prompts as it kept understanding switching contexts. But still it was highly impressive.
I'm just looking forward to when they hook up this kind of AI into one of those Boston Dynamics robots and we can finally have robot servants we can talk to like we always dreamed of in sci-fi! It increasingly feels like we are FINALLY ""living in the future"" like we expected we would by the year 2000!
When this is really working as being shown it is indeed mindblowing. Great job!
Can't wait to try it,with all the understanding this model is able to do it's just amazing.
Very impressive. I didn't expect this kind of thing so early. It just has been a year since AI war started and we come this far.
Unfortunately, what you see is not at all what happened. The AI does not actually reply to the person but to a script and pictures containing sometimes more information than we are shown here
Wow, Gemini is incredibly impressive! The combination of multimodal capabilities and its ability to interact with different formats like text, images, and even code is truly groundbreaking. I especially loved the showcase of visual puzzles and image & text generation. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with AI and open up new possibilities for learning and creative expression
It's truly fascinating to see what AI is now capable of!
This is incredible!! Now if we can combine this with an embodied agent that can navigate through the world, plan out sequences of actions from interactions with the user, and use RL to learn from mistakes and learn about the user, that would be gg!
I can't imagine the amount of data used to train Gemini! this is next level, and if it has Open AI's new voice type, then this will be the greatest multimodal ai
It's kinda crazy how intelligent this AI is on the fly and is considered a basic model by them, the stuff they have behind the scenes is far more advanced.
I find this mindblowing! Although What Im more exited about what is going to happen next, for the past year OpenAi has been without competition so they have probably not been in full gear, now that google and openai have caught on it sure to mean an AI race is going to start with a ridicolous speed of progress
Fascinating 😮 I can’t wait to see what we’ve accomplished in another 5 years

Moment of silence for those who still haven't hit townhall 15 yet...
Subscribe for all the update sneak peeks! What are your thoughts on the TH16 Nature Theme Design?

I Beat Clash of Clans with a BROKEN Account: https://youtu.be/sxCk13hStf0?si=KXOMCU5-mJC3JtFb
In my opinion, the TH 16 theme is like a combination of the natural themes of TH 14, the luxury of TH 11, and the fiery red of TH 10.
The ability to attack against yourself is probably the “biggest” improvement. The practice potential is limitless!
I really love the aesthetic of the th16, after all those magical, futuristic, theme we go back to nature theme and its kinda refreshing
epic update Judo 👏🏽👏🏻👏🏽
It's really nice to see that they reduced the upgrade times. Upgrade times at th16 are like 5 days less than the current th15 upgrades
You know, I'm actually very happy about this color design. The last few have always been these overly ecstatic colors, and this one is more regal... It's a nice change of pace, in my opinion.
One interesting thing I noticed is that there was just one archer on the archer tower at 7:52 
We might be getting a merge defenses option and the number of archers on the archer tower might indicate something, maybe like when we merge 2 towers, it will show two archers on it
the option for self attacks in friendly challenges is really cool, seems very fun and very helpful for trying out attacks and bases 🙂
I personally think with the entirety of nature being the theme at their disposal, they did miss out on an opportunity to have a much cooler wall design. But I like the theme overall :)
I feel like the skill gap and level will increase tremendously after the attacking your own base change. People will be practicing a whole lot more often.
#4 on trending, you've come so far, Judo. Thanks for entertaining me all these years. You got me back into this game. And i couldn't be any happier. I cant wait for th16 even though im a th14 😂
The ability to attack yourself is going to be a game changer considering the friendly army doesn't need training time, the practice potential it has is just amazing especially for casual players like me who doesn't bother with a 12 step hybrid attack strat (the top clans and players are also major beneficiaries of this) I'm sure we'll be seeing all kinds of new attack strats soon after the update
I’m excited! But as a max TH15, it kinda feels a little early. I feel like a lot of people are still trying to grind out TH15, TH14, and even TH13. Should be a lot of fun! The magical items help so much. Makes a big difference in wait times.
Suprisingly, im actually looking forward to the self challenge feature the most rather than the electro and balloon new upgrade. This will will a huge boon as I always wanted to practice against other level 15 townhalls (although soon other level 16 townhalls)
My best guess for New troop is an elf, dryad or a nature summoner, hope well see two new building in action and more interaction
I believe the new troop will be a druid. TH 15 introduced the electro Titan which fit very well with its theme
I’m glad that this update has features that will be cool for other town halls too, like the “attack yourself” option.",20,Gaming,2730000,PT13M42S

This was an unexpected turn for the schedule, but I would genuinely feel bad not screaming out The Black Parade exists.
The absolute best line from the FAQ in the docs for this custom campaign:

""Q: Are you guys fans of My Chemical Romance?
A: No. This is what happens when you think you have a cool name and don’t Google it beforehand.""
I love the thief video series, the game is two decades old but it is one of the most creative and fun retro games you can play.
Damn, this mod looks amazing! It fills my heart knowing there's a dedicated group of old Thief fans like myself making love letters to this legendary trilogy. The scale of the maps is unreal and I wanna get lost in them snagging loot. Can't wait to play this!
You know smth is gonna be good when Mandalore resurrects the Mod Spotlight series to talk about it.

Seriously though would love to see you cover more mods on games.
This man will do absolutely anything to avoid making the Thief 4 video.
I was given the honor of betatesting this absolute behemoth, and all I can say to my fellow Thief fans is: go play it if you want to experience Thief as if it was the first time
11:23 What are you so frightened of? Come to me...
It was seriously a privilege to have gotten to do voicework and later betatest this beast. I will forever be in awe of the dedication and craft of the team. Hope you enjoyed my contribution, and may The City never die!
I can only imagine how proud someone must be who, as a creator, made a game with the technology they had available at the time. And then 25 years later, the fans of that which you have created have been compelled enough to carry forward and expand upon your work with this scale.
Blessed be the mod makers. I salute you all for your community service. If only you could create as much as you wish. Hopefully the artists wont starve some day.
Every time Thief content reaches broad audience it feels like something to celebrate
How crazy is this. The mod solidifies lore from multiple games. I would love for all companies to take so much care of their IPs. Make them deeper, fix problems etc. This mod should be a template for all sequels. 

I think gaming lost a LOT when the concept of expansions died. The same engine, more missions, more lore, just more. This mod is clear proof how much value this concept can add without pushing the games technology too much further.
Once again, Mandy proves to be the saviour of the broken, defeated and the damned. And also signal-boosting one of the coolest things to come out of the modding scene this year.

I should really get into this after Arcane Dimensions. And also Wizordum.
It was a privilege to be able to contribute to this, it's truly a landmark in the Thief community and all the new developments on display are going to be a real game changer- the same way Thief 2X was all the way back in 2005.
Daily reminder that everyone should check out The Dark Mod. It's an standalone total conversion of Doom 3 that's Thief but legally distinct, and it has an active community of Thief veterans that make missions throughout the year. For a free fan game, it's an impressive testament of how passionate the Thief modding community is even when the franchise is dead.

We’ve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it’s lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? 

Well, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. 

Then we have the Lambo. It’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it’s a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg. It also has a much bigger top speed, coming in at 190mph. 

So the Cybertruck has the Urus beat when it comes to performance stats, but will the extra weight drag it down? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!",10243,"What has the world come to, a Lamborghini losing a race to a polygon.
Obviously the Cybertruck has lesser polygons and so it render and thus runs faster.
One could imagine how much it breaks Yanni's heart to see the Urus lose like that.
Cyber truck is a beast but the everyday people won’t be able to afford it.
A refrigerator that goes from 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds….now that’s fast food!
What’s frightening is how fast and sharp that box is that doesn’t stop too well 😬

To see something so big moving so fast is just insane.
Gutted I was not there for this
It's often easy to know which car wins even before they race. 98% of the time it's the car Matt is driving 😂
You can imagine how sad Yanni was when he saw the Urus team losing the game like this.
Its easy to predict which car will win in your drag races, Mat - it is always the car you are driving! 😇😃
I noticed in the last video and in this one too that the cybertruck appears to have a slow start in the first 1/8 to 1/4 second to prevent any wheel spin, then the full power is applied once the tires are connected..and from that point it just goes!
I wonder if Matt will ever be allowed to use a Pagani for anything. Even just a review or something would be amazing to see, I think he'd have a great time with something like that
It has great design and amazing new technologies.
Matthew likes the idea of winning. He has to be in a faster vehicle. Even if they swap cars, he has to go back to the faster one.
I wish I could be one of the construction workers there on lunch break watching you guys race. I am sure they are placing bets out there
7:10 Looks like Uris is still rolling at 30mph. The contrast in acceleration is incredible!
Just imagine seeing that big ass boat move that fast in person 😂
Such an important race.  Whatever car wins the race, is deemed the car that went fast in a short distance! Very cool thing to be known for!",2,Autos & Vehicles,8800000,PT10M18S

Oh don't let anything start to trend on social media 😐, it's over from that there💀.

Music
Oddwin - 19",2757,"If this video gets popular I will stop smiling
I have a weird love-hate relationship with fandoms sometimes. They’re the life blood of keeping a series going, but they also attract people who have nothing to do with the fandom except diss on it.
Imma be so mad if this video gets popular, this is such a small community and i don’t want outsiders ruining it!
Seen it happen to tv shows, movies, music artists, even certain video games. I honestly wonder what makes some ppl hate something good just because it’s popular.
This is so accurate, there are just some people that hate stuff because they want to be different to the majority, it's really weird, you don't need to like it too, but imagine changing your opinion on something from positive to negative because it's popular.
""Dont look away, take accountability! Whats wromg with you?!""
I felt that im my damn soul bro
This is a common phenomenon. What happens is that when a show gets REALLY popular, people will start saying they dislike it SPECIFICALLY to be contrarian. The reasoning behind why they do this is because they want to be seen as ""different"" or ""special"" compared to everyone else (since everyone else likes it).

True individuality is having complex and well thought out opinions on things- not simply disagreeing with the majority.
This is so true. People base their opinions off of media and situations, and not on what they actually feel about the show.
That little pose of when you hear something so frustrating, you have to convulse and experience physical pain before carrying with the conversation was so damn accurate 💀💀💀
It's even worse when they try and guilt trip you for liking the show when they were the ones who introduced you to it in the first place 💀💀💀
I don't know how you can so accurately portray such absurd moments. You've got a gift!
I've heard people explain the reason they start to hate something that's popular is because they will constantly see and hear about it. I suppose even if you like something it can get boring or even irritating if it's constantly shoved in your face. Kinda like eating the same food over and over. Eventually you get sick of it.
I personally love when something I love becomes popular. That just means there’s more people to share the love with. And if everyone loves it, it must be that good.
I'm glad the GOAT of skits is back. Also, I can relate to this video hard. I love this vid. I think Caleb should be in a legit movie kinda like CoryxKenshin. Also, Caleb's on a roll with the Google sponsors. Nice job
This is so damn true, I'm glad that some underrated stuff gets more recognition but at the same time it sucks because you'll have a ""superior"" group that does stuff like in the video
Relatable, absurd. I love how much Caleb can communicate with just a head nod or a gesture.
And i love the totally unnecessary arm-flailing when Jordan runs off.
That's why I disassociate myself from popular things so I can diss them without guilt. Then 5 years later, I watch and inevitably enjoy them after all the hype is over. Brilliant strategy.
Man Caleb, even after all these years your videos are still BANGERS. I don't know how you think these up, keep up the great work!
As much as I hate to say it, this is relatable. I tend to like something early on and almost every time it ends up being enjoyed by everyone. Then I started to hate the community of the thing because it has less nuance and personality now. Like the fact that people are around the thing I like makes me not want to be around the thing I like. Which over time has lead me to express interest in things a little more fringe and underground that would be hard for the masses to spotlight. I still like these things, I just avoid them whenever people start talking about it because I almost don't want to burn out on the things I like. I believe the accepted term for this phenomenon is being a bitch ass hipster.
Funny enough, had just this conversation with my friend an hour ago. Just because something is trending and is super popular doesn't necessarily diminish the quality of the product in the slightest...",23,Comedy,4790000,PT3M13S
CA,_inKs4eeHiI,KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,2023-12-13T15:43:38Z,,4120394,275152,"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8

This spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world’s most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. 

After three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to … give it a rest already. More specifically, he’s tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.

That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. 

Even worse, there’s been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po’s Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. 

So, Po’s going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po’s fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon’s reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. 

The film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy Award® winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Po’s adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy Award® nominee Bryan Cranston as Po’s birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifu’s former student and arch-nemesis. Oscar® winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. 
 
Kung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animation’s The Bad Guys). The film’s co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy Award®-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animation’s highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.

The saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”

The big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), Souheila Yacoub (“The Braves,” “Climax”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).

“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

Villeneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel. The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick. The executive producers are Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.

Villeneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Denis Villeneuve, “Dune: Part Two.” The film is slated for a March 1, 2024 release in theaters and IMAX nationwide and internationally beginning on 28 February 2024, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",7410,"Let's be honest, Denis Villeneuve, the music, the trailer, was just epic. One of the best trailers I have seen in years.
This looks incredible! When we say we want the visuals THIS is what we mean. 😭
I haven't gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years.  This can only be seen properly in theatre.
Denis Villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed. Also the fact that they've built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love Denis and the team have for the process.
This film stands as the cinematic masterpiece we've been yearning for, elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights. Its impact on the sci-fi genre is unprecedented, setting a new benchmark for future endeavors!
“But I do see a way… there is a narrow way through…” I absolutely love the way he said that line! I’m so excited for this movie!
This film is the cinematic brilliance we've been waiting for for decades. It really takes movie making to another level. I really don't think there is any sci-fi series like this one is showing up to be.
By far, one of the finest movie trailer in recent years. The build up is just so powerful and awe-inspiring (especially with the gorgeous music). Denis seems to have outdone himself with this one. This is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope. It is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years. He is also the new master of intelligent and profound Science-Fiction films. I mean, Arrival, Blade Runner: 2049, Dune Part One, Dune Part 2 and most probably following next will be Rendezvous with Rama and Dune: Messiah. An amazingly talented artist.
That SILENCE!! gave me serious chills, I had to watch it again, can't wait to see the actual scene 😭
This is not a movie. This is pure art.
How the heck does Denis Villeneuve deliver yet another ""classic"" that works so ridiculously well this day and age... incredible!! I am just hoping he does more projects similar to this (taking an ""oldie"" and bringing it to the modern audience).
I'm a huge fan of the Dune universe and I absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books!! There's also a game in development called Dune Awakening, so I love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 🥳🥳🥳
This movie franchise is a work of art. Love the books, love everything about Part I, Part II is a must see.
Princess Irulan looks like a prisoner of fate. You can tell the team behind this is on the next level, when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a character's costume embodies their story.
YESSSSSS!!    Throughout the trailer I had goosebumps, bigger than I have ever had! Clean to the end, and even after!!!!   I don’t think I have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does!!!!
Since the first Dune movie, I've been obsessed. Best stuff that has come out of Hollywood in years. Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer go hand in hand here, cause it was the first time I came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score. My Spotify Top 5 of '23 is all Dune :))) Hats off, and I really look forward to Dune 2, not less than how I looked forward to The Return of the King 20 years ago.
Absolutely blown away by this trailer! The visuals, storyline, and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters. Can't wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen!
Major goosebumps. Everything about this looks incredible. I loved Part 1 and I'm all in for Part 2 - I just wish I could watch it now.
The cinematic event I've been waiting for. Dune will win best director, editor, cinematographer, music, costume and VFX. If it doesn't then I don't know what should. This is a pure labour of love. I would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does. Cannot wait!
Denis Villeneuve is an absolute master - I've loved all of his movies, this will be incredible, just like part 1 was...",1,Film & Animation,11300000,PT2M40S

Loved seeing Nabiu with a doortal at 5:33, can't wait for the pilot!

Rauru: “It would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi-“ 

Link: *wing shield jumps disrespectfully*
The five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
I love the ending where it seems that Link is going to save Zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until Link realizes that the speedrun is over.
I don't know what Zelda told Rauru about Link,but he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
I appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch. Even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and I appreciate that you gave it some meaning. And the Ganondorf fight was next level.
I already knew he couldn’t get wrecked like the other endbosses because of *Suavemente* but I never would have expected that his weakness was no *Suavemente* .
Also I laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon.
In all it’s accurate to the source material and continue what you do best.
The fact that Ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and I love it 😂
The life ending neck cracks throughout the Terminal Montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
When Ganon started  dancing Suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears, love the details 😂😂

All the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing, I’ve been waiting for this one for a while
Gotta love how Link doesn't even bother trying to save Zelda the first time, then doesn't even visibly question or react (beyond the mandated QTE) to the fact that she's suddenly appeared out of nowhere in free-fall... and _STILL_ leaves her to take a dunk in the lake. 😂
4:25 this is my favorite moment, you can feel link's determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
A rush of dopamine always hits hard every time I enjoy the chaos of another video. 

Also I love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol.
4:21 I can't imagine how terrified that bokoblin must've been: he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing ""hyah"" sounds, and then Link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
Your animations will never get old
3:25 As much as I find the gloom hands to be terrifying, I would imagine it would be cool if Ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack Lookout landing. It wouldn’t add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like Ganondorf was more of a threat.
4:47 is seriously the coolest attack animation you’ve ever done!
the amount of effort that goes into these is bonkers and I'm so grateful (as, I expect, are the speedrunners!)",20,Gaming,4360000,PT7M18S

#UFC",2092,"Brandon Royval just casually running 10 miles at 6.5-minute pace is impressive. Dude has excellent cardio.
Leon’s first NFL game was one of the worst scoring games ever 😭 3-0
My takeaways from this:
I am absolutely exhausted watching Pantoja workout. What a demon.
Paddy catches a lot of shit. When he’s away from a hot mic regarding fighting, he seems like a good guy.
As an American, I want to apologize to Leon for attending that awful fuckin NFL game.
Heart says Wonderboy 
Brain says Shavkat 😔
Watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art. Shit is so impressive, man.
Tony is 0-6, yet I still can’t wait for his appearance on the embedded.

Guy really is a legend, and a hell of an entertainer. Hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens.
100% respect Colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class. How can you not respect it.
You gotta respect Colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class. Half of the champions in the ufc or more don’t fight at their normal weight class
You can tell that Colby is a good guy and just plays a character. Seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter 🙏🏼 People have to separate the PPV selling Colby from the person he seems to be
The flash of genuine Colby when they brought out the candles, you could tell he loved that
Still makes me sad Pantoja got booed after he won the belt. He left it all in the Octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears. “Dad are your proud of me now “ 

I like both Brandon and Alexandre but I’m rooting for Alexandre
You just can't hate Thompson, so humble
So pumped to see Colby back in action. The guy is a true gem of the sport, hate or love him, he’s thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the Octagon.
Really rooting for Colby to get it done. He is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat Colby twice decisively.
Not a Colby fan but I respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport. He seems to always be in fighting shape. He has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
Thing i love the most about Colby is, He doesnt cut much weight, Maybe 4 kilos, he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
Cool seeing Colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment. This card is gonna be a banger 🔥🔥🔥
Man Wonderboy does not look 40 years old at all! 😳💯
Seeing Pantoja and JDS so happy and down to earth is so damn wholesome
Can tell Colby is actually a really good dude. His manners and respect to the waiter were absolutely tops 👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT9M25S

Music by Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com) & others.",906,"Seeing Chris throw the ball at Harry's mom has to be one of the wildest things I've ever seen 😂
Bidstrup took it like a legend. Huge respect
Edit:Wtf I checked my phone cuz I thought this comment got 1 like 💀💀
It's always a long wait for a new video from Chris. But when it finally arrives, it's a piece of cinematic gold...
The video we've all been waiting for, let us know if you wanna play for us soon 😉
To everyone in the comments, check out our channel for more Chris vs Mads content 🙌
I swear Harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 😭
Bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
Your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
You notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round. They are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge. Small things but big differences
Manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
Chris dashing the ball at W2S mum brought it to another level. 😂
Awesome to see Levi Colwill in this video, met him when Sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against Hamworthy United.
the pros were all really down to earth that's cool to see
The way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
Bidstrup’s a class guy, seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to Gurnsey to record that clip with Harry’s mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
Chris is one of the best YouTube football dribblers, he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still won’t preform the same in a charity match🤦
Crazy that Bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is Di Maria, & Benfica Has just won 3-1 Salzburg.
Di Maria Scoring a Corner Goal. Absolutely INSANEEE!!!
Ive been watching your videos for almost 10 years now and they are always such a fun watch. You still have so much authenticity which almost gives like a nostalgic feeling when i watch your videos

No one but Zachary and Michelle are the best example of love ❤
The way Mackenzie called when the paint fell on the carpet was so honest and wholesome
*It would be great if ZHC would renovate my room too.* 🙃
*Let's just take a moment to appreciate how many hours and work he put into this video? It's amazing, and I think they deserve way more than that!✨*
You should surprise kenz next just because she’s awesome and a great person + she’s hilarious
Michelle is legit the happiest lady with tons of positive energy 😆, good job Zac!
The way you guys gift each other and take care of each other is so sweet <3
Watching this at school instead of doing my work 🙃
zhc never disappoints us
I think it's safe to say we all need a Zach in our lives, I felt every scream Michelle let out of excitement casue I would too. EVERYONE SLAYED THE TRANSFORMATION!! YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!! 😍👏🙌
I was gonna say that would be a perfect room surprise if she was a child and then I saw her reaction and it made sense😂
i just love how she was so amazed that she couldn't say anything else than ""oh my god"" 😄
I love this transformation! Keep doing the hard work. I love it 🥰
Thanks for helping through tough time Zach!
I know this might be a weird request but it would be really cool if they all customized a Starbucks❤️
Watching your videos really makes my day❤
Wish you and Michelle a good happy life together

This series never disappoints, Cool
Looks like the cameraman found the skibidi lab bases! Sound like this is gonna be an interesting episode!
Mad respect for The Large cameraman. He risked his life for recording 67 from 1-4. Now  he is in peace. You will be remembered man
Press F to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman
Rest in peace large cameraman 
You were loved and you helped the cameraman find the factory and protected everyone 
You will be missed
Gran cámaraman tiene mis respetos murió como un gran guerrero que hasta el final protegió a sus compañeros si dudar 🖤
Rest in peace,large cameraman. You've Been a brave soldier,you Will never be forgotten👍
Presione F para presentar sus respetos al camarógrafo grande. Él era el punto de vista del episodio 67. Merece respeto por sacrificarse.
Agora sim o DaFuqBoom se surpreendeu no roteiro, deixou os Titãs de lado e mostrou o que os personagens secundários são capazes, os personagens vão morrendo aos poucos na fábrica dos Skibidis, isso é insano e tenso, epica luta a desse episódio
This almost made me cry. RIP Large Cameraman + RPG. He will always be remembered and be in our hearts. We only got to see him in the previous episode. Same as 66 also. With his last lives, He still did a thumbs up still in pain.😢
*respect to that large cameraman. rest in peace*
Dafuq, as I didn't see almost anyone talking, I'm going to say... You probably won't see this video, but it doesn't matter, I'm sending my strength to you man, every time I go into the comments I see people talking about how the video is or So saying that you are no longer the same. ""I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS SECOND IS ALL OF THEM."" But anyway, I came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us, and for what you have to go through with rude comments, I don't know how you are behind that screen, but I hope you are well, they will probably tell me If anyone sees this, you deserve a rest, man, take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity, go out with your friends, and go to a place to rest your mind... Well, I just said that because I'm really worried about your psychology, all the work you do when it comes to being private, motherfucker, saying skibidi skibidi all the time, and in return getting insults that you're not the same anymore... that's it, probably. No one will read this but it's here, now I'm less worried.
What i love about episode 68, is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story, one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also, R.I.P large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
Dude, the large characters are THE underappreciated heroes, seeing as the large speakerman died, then the large cameraman, that might mean that large TV man is next on the chopping block. RIP large cameraman.
Wow. Inspiring, to say the least. A year ago today I was standing on a 351-849 mile long sandwich 🥪 (which, too be fair, had no mustard) and was about to eat it all 😅. This video, along with the tuna song saved me. ❤

The battery costs more than a brand new car!",Motormouth,2023-12-12T19:00:28Z,"what does it cost to replace an EV battery?,what is the cost to replace a battery in an electric car?,electric car battery cost?,Battery cost for an EV?,zack spencer,andrea spencer,zack spencer's wife,couple car review,motormouth",196923,4954,"This is a Motormouth couple car video discussing the cost to replace the battery in 2022 Hyundai IONIQ 5. After finding out that his battery protection cover was scratched, the owner was told the battery needed to be replace for more than he paid for the car brand new. Over $60,000, so he decided to make a claim on his insurance and have the car written off. This is a cautionary tale to not only EV owners and potential owners but also other manufacturrers, that these kinds of casts are out much more than consumers are expecting to pay. Hyundai Canada was eventually notified to the customers concerns but only after the car had been written off by the insurer. Watch this story and decide for yourself.",1989,"Appreciate you guys shining a light on this. One of the most concerning parts of these stories is that the manufacturers don't seem to want to help until each story goes public. That needs to change.
Big respect for you guys to give a spotlight of this issue.
Now is definitely NOT the time to be buying a car. Average car cost $47K?! That's insane!
Check your ego at the door - you need a vehicle to get back and forth to work, not to impress anyone. An auto finance rate of 7%+ is an insult to anyone with excellent credit. No thanks. Those new cars can sit on the lot and rot away for all I care.
Dealing with the dealerships is bad enough for small issues, my father had to fight a year for a replacement engine under factory warranty for oil consumption, but raise the stakes to the cost of a new EV battery and these stories are heartbreaking and disastrous. I was an avid EV supporter until recent years; I'm now very convinced the auto industry is screwing this up! Thank you for covering Kyle's story.
Wow.  I remember all the uproar about people having to pay $26K on a $100K+  Tesla Model S battery replacement.  This is just next level.
Thanks, Kyle, for reaching out to Andrea and Zach. Thank you, Andrea and Zach for shedding light on this awful situation that is bound to snowball industry wide in the years to come. I'm glad you've acted as an advocate and brought your notable presence to this guys terrible experience.  What a nightmare. Best wishes Kyle!
I’d like Zach and Andrea giving me all of my news, not just for car stuff. I really appreciate the way they followed this from start to finish.
Excellent video as always, you guys! Poor Kyle, I feel for him.

I’m an old guy, and honestly, I just don’t understand this rush to go to EV and/or hybrid vehicles. I get to save the environment, I get fuel cost, I get all of those things, but let’s face it cars today and trucks for that matter are so much more fuel efficient than they were back when I first started driving in the 80s. I think of the very first car I owned a 1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo with a big Honkin V8 in it, that used leaded fuel, lol.

I realize I’m probably being somewhat hyperbolic, but the reality is, and your channel validates this, consumers are buying big honking, SUVs, and great big cars and trucks to haul their family, or stuff around. It’s just ridiculous!

If we want to make the world, a safer, cleaner, and more environmentally, friendly place, let’s build  more little Honda Civic hatchbacks like we used to do back in the day. That’s all anybody really needs. All these soccer moms that I see at my local school, dropping kids off and picking kids up every day in giant pick up trucks and SUV and sitting for 10 or 15 minutes with their engines idling makes me laugh. 

No one seems too concerned about the environment when they’re making the school run, lol.

Electric vehicles will probably get there someday, and there will be teething problems. However, at this point, I just don’t think enough analysis has really been done to the cause and effect of the switch to consumers, and to the environment.

What is the cost going to be to bring more Hydro electricity plants online, where is that power going to come from?

What’s the economic impact going to be to consumers, employers, and companies as we move from fossil fuels to electricity. How many thousands or even millions of people may potentially be out of work? What impact does that have to the global economy? How does that affect the environment?

Anyway, sorry for the rant, you guys are amazing, love the channel!
I agree with Andrea. I'm sure Hyundai is not the only brand with disappointments. I was in the market for an EV, but I was hesitant. I stuck to ICE. After hearing similar stories on these batteries being the major cost of any EV, new or old, I'm gonna continue to wait. The anxiety may not just be range but bankruptcy as well. Great content Motormouth. You are a great source of information.
Mad props for helping out a fellow Canadian. It is absolutely ridiculous that this happened to him. Thank you for helping him out and hopefully he gets some justice out of the situation. No ones insurance should have to suffer over something like this?
I'm glad Kyles' story made it into publics eye. There are many cases like his that happen quite often and big corporations just take advantage of these hard working people.
Thank you for reporting on this matter. This is a risk I would not have anticipated. It is fair to say that this type of road hazard will be present for all Canadian drivers. I am a bit surprised about how the matter was treated by the insurance provider. It doesn’t seem reasonable to reassess Kyle as a high risk operator and double his coverage cost for the next ten years.
Thank you folks for bringing this to our attention. This is shocking to say the least, and I am very disappointed at how all of this was handled. How can anyone justify the price of that replacement battery!?!? Shady deal!
The key here to me is what they both pointed out. It is pretty hard to deny the price of the Battery when it is shown with a part number. Who wants to take a wild guess at how many Phone calls and dealership visits are going to be made over the next few days asking for a quote to replace the battery of their new EV. I know one who will be making the call. Thank you both and thank you to Kyle for this info.
It's good to make consumers aware of this. Thank you for sharing. It seems unjustifiable that the replacement battery costs $56k. The entire car when new cost about that, which included the battery. So it sounds like Hyundai is putting a massive markup on replacement batteries. They really need to explain that. I feel really bad for this guy. He's financially screwed no matter what he does in this situation. This is a good lesson to learn about being an early adopter of new technology. It doesn't come cheaply.
This video and story is both heartbreaking for Kyle and also a fantastic PSA. Thank you for sharing this!
Thank you for exposing this and sharing such an illogical and frustrating story. We need to hold these corrupt companies responsible and demand better service, warranties, and right to repair that serve the customer. Let's just say this for what it is - this so called green vehicle saving on emissions etc, is a single-use vehicle. If the battery costs more than the entire vehicle brand new, Hyundai/Kia has created a disposable vehicle.
So glad the two of you are covering these aspects of car ownership that don't get enough publicity.
Thank you Andrea, Zach and Kyle for sharing this story for us all - kudos! Really hope Hyundai does right by Kyle and quickly!!
Good for you @motormouth for bringing this to the attention of many. I like that you didn’t weren’t afraid challenge a large manufacturer, nor be silenced in any way. The current situation is outrageous for EV buyers, the manufacturers need to sort this out ASAP.",2,Autos & Vehicles,318000,PT17M26S

Kratos is not just the god of war,but he is now,the god of hope.
Kratos, the Spartan, the god of war, and most importantly, the father of boy, is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts.
There's something eerie about seeing a younger Kratos in this modern light. I've grown to love the Older Kratos, but at the same time you are terrified of the younger Kratos.
The god of war becomes the god of hope. I think we can all agree that Kratos deserved this ending more than anything.
Everyone's talking about Young Kratos (and rightfully so), but can we give a round of applause for Tyr? The fact we got to fight him not once, but FOUR TIMES was amazing. And that last encounter? Pure Awesome.
That young Kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look. They did great job in representing young wild Kratos who still doesn't seem to understand what was going on with him at that point🔥
If old kratos hates himself from the past, you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed. What an absolute legend
Seeing Tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more, he truly has traveled a lot
Kratos really came full circle. He became the God of Hope. When all else was lost he still found hope to move on. I’m happy to see he never forgotten Pandora’s words.
The size difference and the different vibes young Kratos and Old Kratos have is amazing. Specially when young Kratos moved from his pose, it was so menacing
I'm not gonna lie, I almost teared up watching this ending.

Mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching Kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational.

Definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way.
Looking at this scene, I can't help but think how many times I have wanted to do the exact same thing Kratos did. Staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young, selfish, stupid, cruel, and nothing more than a lowly piece of work, but then realize how far I have come in my years. I needed this more than anyone could realize. Kratos, your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that I was in tears. Your story, one of death, destruction, and chaos, but also of love, redemption, and hope. You bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question: Who am I? We are who we choose to be, both of our past, and of our present.
Love how Kratos finally confronts all his regrets, and it hits hard.
God of War Ragnarok Valhalla Full movie / All cutscenes: https://youtu.be/b2vyOIMZgnI
7:58 This scene gotta be the most powerful scene in the whole gow franchise🔥
6:50 — 9:52
This is honestly Christopher Judge’s best performance I have ever seen. The emotions, the anger, the hate and then the sadness to pure realisation in his voice honestly made me teary inside.
This was such an emotional journey. Thank you so much to Santa Monica Studio for this beautiful gift. They're amazing for this who agrees with me? Seeing young Kratos meet with redeemed Kratos, facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light. This hits home for me because I suffer with mental health disorders and seeing Kratos face his younger self will be me when I recover.
Kratos confronting his younger self…
In my head, I picture that he’s gaining closure with his bloodthirsty past, and telling him that THIS is what he needed to become. The god of hope. The father of Boy. The god of redemption.
After everything Kratos has been through... He's earned this.",20,Gaming,1550000,PT13M29S

Suggestion: the wolf armor could be colored with dyes, like the leather pieces!
I sincerely hope they make it so you can dye the wolf armour later on or maybe trim it or something
Excited for the last big 1.21 announced feature so far in the armadillo and wolf armour, very curious what will be coming in the rest of the update now :)
The armadillo and wolf armour look great in-game! Didn't expect to see it done so soon!
Can it be enchanted? Can we dye it? I hope they keep developing it so its a viable item to get for our dogs.
Suggestion: Can it be enchanted? Protection IV on wolf armour would be awesome!
“Trust us to introduce a cuddly new mob and give it the yuckiest food imaginable” 
Fireflies:
Wolf armor and the armadillo are better than expected
Suggestion: Can we enchant the armor? Like with thorns or even protection? Just to get the most out of it
Finally a use for spider eyes other than brewing. I wish they ate rotten flesh as well but I can just give those to the wolves.
It would be cool to be able to upgrade it with a smithing table, maybe even add trims. Being able to dye the armour is also something i see all over the comments ofc.
Aw sad to see the eye placement from the concept art not carry over. It so much more accurate to what actual armadillos look like and would have looked so much cuter/less goofy than the current iteration.
we all thought it was gonna be like one defense, but daimond armor for wolfs is sick
Minecraft monthly has to be one of my favourite official Minecraft shows. Vu is an amazing host 💚
*Ravines, Cliffs, Oceans and Lava:* ""Let us introduced ourselves""

I can finally bring my wolves on adventures instead of leaving them as a decoration in my house. 🐺
would be cool if you could put interments like protection 4 and blast protection or fire protection or why not all of them.

Honestly a solid game by the leafs! Great Defence by Beniot/Laggesson/Mccabe and exactly the kind of Defence we need if we are going into the playoffs with this core! Also Big ups to Jones for his first full game
Another win and 2 more goals for Matthews who now leads the league with 21 goals by Canada's favourite team!  GLG!!! 🍁💯
Matthews and McCabe were the stars tonight. McCabe just deflated the Rangers in the third and it was just a beautiful thing to watch. Reminiscent of Todd Gill, Wendel Clark and Darcy Tucker.  Getting hits in when they are sorely needed.
Jonesy looked solid in net tonight, made some big saves that really held us in there 👏
3 of 4 points in NY! I'll take it. Its even more impressive when you consider the leafs are missing 3 starting defencemen, their #1 goalie and the flu is running through the entire leaf team right now. Go! Leafs Go!
Hate the fact that my fav American team lost, but love the fact my fav Canadian team won. Go Leafs Go!
This is why I like Nylander and Matthews together. You let Nylander dance, find some open space, then slide it over to Matthews pure finisher.
This is the kind of hockey you get when the Leafs' top lines are clicking.
*Good  game* rangers. I almost had a leaf heart attack when it was 4-3.
Man this was a real statement win for the leafs. Down a first line forward, half the D core is hurt, third string goalie is playing and besides the second period clobbered one of the best teams in the nhl
Never thought Trouba would get the save of the week.
I nearly had the classic ""leafs heart attack"" after period 2... but luckily it didn't end that way
Mathews with 4 points and Marty shut the door perfect!!
Good game from the Leafs and a stellar performance from Martin Jones!
respecting Nylander gives Matthews & Marner space to operate. That's what happens when you do both shoot and pass at a high level
Auston Matterws is why I tune into Toronto highlights.
Good push back by NY but Toronto too much for them tonight.
They should have dads trips more often, and maybe even in the playoffs
Ну наконец то .. Полностью показали свою мощь!!! 💪💪💪👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
I can't believe this leafs team.. what an amazing team they have become. I lived in Toronto for almost 30 years and remember the days of Courtnall, Iafrate, Salming, Clarke, Domi, and the rest of them... The struggle they went through during those days was heartbreaking, I moved to the U.K. 12 years ago and am so happy to see them doing so good.",17,Sports,907000,PT10M25S

I started watching fantasy high when the first two season had already been filmed. I was going into my freshman year of highschool the summer i started. I rewatched both seasons over and over, I started dnd campaigns and watched all of the new dnd adventures as they came out. In 2024, i graduate. I have a plan to go to college to write a book one day. This series and its actors have been integral to my growth and life throughout highschool, and in my worst moments and exam seasons I have turned to them for a break, a reminder than I'm not alone. I can't express enough how much it means to me to see another season of this after all the changes and growth I've gone through.
I’m in love with how visible the improvements in the set & budget are from Fantasy High: Freshman Year. So excited to see the story of the original intrepid heroes continue!
as someone who got into dimension 20 earlier this year, i literally could not be happier that this is going on now!!! the first episode is coming out the month i turn 16 and i genuinely feel like im growing with the characters
This.... this means that Senior Year will also eventually happen right? I don't wanna get too ahead of myself but these lovable goofs/role models got me anticipating two seasons for the price of one. Insane hype.

""I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,"" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.

Laufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with ""From The Start,"" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's ""Let You Break My Heart Again"" and ""Promise,"" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with ""California and Me,"" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.

I can't think of a more ""NPR"" artist than Laufey. Perfect match.
This is my first time hearing this melodious voice.  Laufey and her band woke me up this morning. What a joy.
Is it just me, but I can’t help but admire her in every possible way
i wish this tiny desk would last like 1 hour, 19 minutes of laufey's voice IS NOT ENOUGH
That was unbelievable, I had only ever heard the first song before. I just cried my eyes out. I can’t remember the last time music I hadn’t hear before hit me on such an emotional level. Such perfectly crafted songs, such palpable melancholy. I am overwhelmed in the best way possible.
Such a beautiful voice 😊. I've listened to Laufey's songs during the past few months and seeing her perfoming live at Tiny Desk is such a treat. I've had teary eyes during Promise 😢. I'd love to see her live one day :).
Her voice scale, control and timbre are just incredible. She reminds me of Ella in how she hits her lows. New fan.
What an honor to play chamber music with Laufey on this series 🤍 Hope soon again ✨
As a person who grew up in the classical music world, fell in love with it and then had to leave it behind, listening to you is simply a warm hug to the heart. Just thank you Laufey, amazing ❤

Yusuf Amir is so lucky, this is the first GTA Online video that has less dislikes and the community is less pissed. 😂
i love this so far; the game feels fun again and more alive. even just adding the animals has made things so much better. i love the new cars and im playing the missions rn. thanks rockstar, banger after banger.
can we all appreciate how long rockstar has kept gta 5 alive? its awesome to see a game from my childhood still relevant all these years later
Amir is one of my favorite side characters it the series and its so good seeing him back.
It's crazy that even as adults these trailers still make us feel like kids again.
For me one of the best updates so far. Thanks Rockstar thats what we want.
It's not a game it's pure GOOSEBUMPS ❤
I was convinced they couldn't add no more content to gta online lol but they gotta keep us entertained somehow gta online is the appetizer but we all know what the main course is 😋
Fico imaginando, algum dia a Rockstar conseguir fazer um mundo aberto para o GTA, com pelo menos uma região de cada País do mundo ou pelo menos os Países mais populares de cada região, iria ser INSANO se isto algum dia acontecesse
The drift handling and the drift mode are AMAZING!!! ❤

Yusuf easily one of the best GTA characters ever, lots of laughs in TBoGT. I never thought we'd see him again. It's a shame that R* gave up on expansions, so many characters could be better explored like Lamar, Yusuf, Roman Bellic, etc.",20,Gaming,10300000,PT30S

#EtherealWorkshop #Evolayersen",470,"Flasque has become by far my new favourite monster. I can’t even describe how much I love him. His sound is UNREAL
The Plasma quad being a banshee is actually genius.
All references of number of elements in the design:
Meebkin: three fingers, three bumps on tail + head crest, three creatures (meebkin itself and two meebs)
Gaddzooks: three eyes, three toes, three mouths
Yooreek: three fingers 
Blarret: three mouths, three nails
Auglur: three hands
Nitebear: three eyes, three toes, three fingers (brown hand), three body sections (brown half, blue half, greenish head)
Flasque: three sections of the head, three toes, three floating flasks
Whaill: four toes
Fun fact: gadzooks now has a new track (the one that was teased but was never shown on the new island
Was not expecting how these new monsters would sound, but I do like them all a lot! It is nice to see the island be extended with these additions, and while there is still a long way to go, I can already start to see the direction this island will take!
I can’t wait to hear what the rest of the song brings. These new guys are all great!
Flasque is so satisfying to hear. It’s like monster ASMR
I love how Nitebear is straight up inspired from FNaF, but also keeping it original
Whaill adds so much more to the song, now im curious for what the full song will be like
You can already tell that this island is gonna look chaotic and sound amazing when its done.
They’ve changed the vibe of the song completely!
I’m glad we got a metal clanging sound. It fits the workshop vibe. My only complaint is the Whaill verse. It sounds cool but it doesn’t flow too well into the next verse.
Was wondering when Gadzook's second track would be implemented.  Love the new verse.  Song is beautiful so far!
Flasque is putting in such insane work
I love how they added another track for Gaddzooks and how Nitebear is based on FNAF. Whaill looks absolutely great as well. The MSM developers really are putting their love into the game.
I have an affinity towards Mech elementals thanks to Vhamp, and Nitebear had satisfied my cravings as a FNAF fan. The other 2 are great too.
Damn this sounds great. Can't wait for future updates.
I thought this island was gonna be ruined by more monsters but they definitely made it better
Honestly I wish the other more stable ethereals were on the island, but it is really good!
I love that none of them have any kind of synergy but they do at the same time",20,Gaming,500000,PT1M46S

Website: https://www.tntsports.co.uk/",618,"Miller on 300 is a great call. Unbelievable career, and he absolutely deserves a spot on that card.
As much as I do love Dana. I think he cares more about this Jones - Stipe fight than any of the fans do
And Adam never stepped foot in the war room again after that role play bit 😂
bro just sorted out Jim Miller, what a man
Jim Miller UFC 100,200 and now 300 what a Carrier he's had.
Dana’s face on 8:23 🤣🤣 I can’t cope
Aspinal should ONLY be fighting for the title at this point.
That role play def went better in your head 😂 Great interview as always bro
I really want to find someone actually still interested in the Jones v Stipe fight. Even when the fight got cancelled I was infinitely more excited about the Tom v Pav fight. 

Now that we have to wait even longer for it it’s just going to feel more and more anticlimactic by the time the fight actually comes around. 

The UFC has always moved with the times better than any other sports organisation. But on this subject this is one of those rare times that I feel they’re going in the wrong direction.
The fans want Aspinall fighting for gold.
I dont see the reasoning why Jones and Stipe ""Deserve"" to fight eachother ahead of Aspinall. Deserve is such a compicated word. Nobody deserves anything unless they earn it. How has a guy whos fought once at Heavyweight and another guy who lost his last fight years ago earned the right to be at the top of the pile? Meanwhile Aspinall is fighting anyone he can get his hands on at short notice and saving cards and he gets told to wait. Its absolutely stinks
So freaking excited for Saturday. I am fully expecting Covington to win, but I’m just so pumped for the whole card. Can’t wait to watch it.
Fair play to Catterall, he just got Jim Miller on the 300 card. Miller owes him a drink
I've never been to a UFC event and I would love nothing more than to one day go to one
Aspinall vs Miocic makes so much sense. Would be a great fight for 300
8:21 Danas face 🤣🤣🤣
Get Aspinall to the new Co Op arena in Manchester next year, will be the biggest arena in the UK
Jim Miller in UFC 300 really needs to hapoen. Been saying it for weeks.
That's a world record in itself.
Who from that era can say that today ?
Dana White has an aura that influences who ever is interviewing him, No one dares to ask him the question he don't want to answer , dude is savage.
Great interview, Adam has stepped up and become a likable face of BT UFC coverage after Dan left",17,Sports,5130000,PT19M16S

December 4th will forever be one of the best days of our lives!! 

""An adoption is finalized when all of the necessary post-placement requirements have been met. When people ask, “When does the adoption become final for the adopting parents?” In most adoptions, the final adoption hearing occurs around six months after placement, although some hearings can happen as little as three months or up to a year after placement.""

""Traditionally, adoption finalization occurs in a courtroom, although more and more judges are offering final adoption hearings over video-call or phone call.

My dad is a family court judge and he finalizes adoptions all of the time and I just think adoption is so incredibly beautiful. You guys are the sweetest family 🫶
Your grandparents dressing up is the highlight of my day, grandpa even wore a shirt and tie. That’s so heartwarming, May the blessings of this season shine through your family ❤️
Congratulations!  This video brought back such great memories and happy tears of our adoption finalization 11 years ago.  The words “as if she were born to both of you” were also my favorite words from our hearing.  What a blessing adoption is!
Currently 7 weeks with my first xx sending love to you guys ❤️
Congratulations! Adoption is beautiful and so is your family ❤️
So excited for you all! My husband and I just got home study approved and are waiting for our miracle ❤
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST PARENTS! SHE IS SO BLESSED TO HAVE YOU GUYS! CONGRATULATIONS!
Congratulations to adopting her guys!!!
Ya'll got me in a puddle of tears!! So happy for ya'll!! What a blessing to have Story Belle in your family!! God is so good!
I have always been a strong believer in ""things happen for a reason"" and your journey literally proves it. All the tears, struggles, and complications have led you to this. Proud of you guys. Always keep your heads up and keep moving forward!!! ❤
Man I’m balling. Congratulations on the finalisation.

This fills me with such hope as I too am on an infertility journey and it shows having a family can happen in anyways possible.
You didn't think you would cry... Girl, I cried my eyes out for your beautiful family ❤😊 I know this year is gonna be the start to all the traditions you create with your daughter! A truly blessed Christmas 🎄
I don’t think I’ve ever cried happy tears for any family more than I have for yours. Thank you for sharing with us ❤️
Crying watching this while I nurse my 3 week old daughter. Daughters are such beautiful gifts. ❤
Congratulations Bella and Dallin on adopting Story Belle! 💕
As an adopted person, I love this video. So wholesome and amazing! My gotcha day is Feb 5, also in the wintertime like Story. I hope she has a great life and gets to know about how special she is like I have gotten to learn about myself over the years. Absolutely dazzling, cannot wait to continue watching this journey of your precious family 💞
God this made me so emotional. Just knowing the journey you both have been  on and all the trials and errors, you now have your forever baby and i’m so incredibly happy for the THREE of you❤
Brings back all the wonderful memories of when we adopted our son 25 yo. The solemnly spoken words of a new forever family.
Congratulations to your beautiful family! I'm usually a silent watcher (minus the likes), but I had to comment on this one since it is so close to my heart. I was adopted at 9 months old on July 21st 1997 and it has been the biggest blessing for the past 27 years. Your journey is special and thank you all for being vulnerable and sharing it with the world. I believe you guys will bring so much hope and healing to so many out there who have gone through similar seasons. Praying for the Lord to bless your family abundantly.

Props to Keith and Becky for keeping their baby very private. Shows they're already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them.
The mystery event is 100% a 24 hour livestream of Eugene sitting on Keith's lap.
so much respect for Keith and Becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality *ahem*. that is the way to raise a child as a public figure. congrats to you both!
I appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to Eugene. The fact that he’s off making his dreams come true and they don’t make him pick try guys over that is amazing. He’s still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy ❤
I can’t believe the return of candid competition isn’t the biggest announcement that’s incredible news
I consider Kwesi an official Try Guy. He fits so well, he’s so perfect. So funny and sweet.
even though the situation that caused it was awful, i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible. the variance of content, the variance of on-camera personalities, it's all such a breath of fresh air. there's so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now, there really is something for everyone.
I miss Eugene, but we're all proud of him, and excited for everything he's a part of. I struggle with change, but y'all make it exciting.
I would love to see another episode about Zach talking about his chronic pain management. Him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot!
The best thing Try Guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in. Jared, Kwesi, Johnny, Marissa are the best additions to the Try Family.
Okay, I gotta say. You guys blow my mind. I first arrived here because of ~the event~ but I stayed here because I liked your personality, and because I was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or “dumb” they are. In the past year I’ve been learning more and more about how you manage the company, how you create more content, etc and wow, I respect it so much. And this video just confirmed it even more for me.
Honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the Keith and Zach channel and Eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and Zach and Keith have always been my favorite try guys
I've said it before and I'll say it again. This channel has the most talented editors. Every single video looks SO incredible.
I really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen. So happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth!
i am so damn proud of them. To see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years, i am SO DAMN PROUD
We miss Eugene when he's not here, but I'm so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them, I hope it all turn out great for him <3
The way they are so candid about why they’re charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on YouTube is incredible honestly I love that about them
I love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship
I did NOT KNOW Eugene voiced in Nimona!!! Sad to hear he’ll be less in videos but letting him follow his dreams is also so incredibly exciting!",23,Comedy,8060000,PT8M23S

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1438,"David de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade I hate how he was brushed aside.
Ten Hag in his post match said, we played well, and we didn't deserve to lose😂😂
I can't believe you actually thought they would win, Mark.  With that team?  ""We are Manchester United""?  Yep, a mid-table team with horrible players and management.  It will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4.
But Mark, you have to admit that other than Martinez, Ten Hag’s signings have been just terrible and very expensive
The problem is that because ETH rates players like Onana, Antony, Mount and Mctominay, I don’t rate him.
Karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like it's gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
Figure it out, ETH wanted Onana,he got him . Not the Glazers, ETH .Accountability!
What does accountability of Ten Hag mean if a possibility of firing him isn’t on the table?
Manchester United are the first Premier League side to finish bottom of their UCL group on two occasions (Also 2005/06).  Record breakers. Also the first English side to concede 15 goals in UCL.
Onana has been a revelation in goal….a terrible revelation that Ten Hag has no f**kin’ clue. Cheers Erik!😂
For me it's Mainoo, simple as that...The kid's got a needle eye for a through ball and he's brave enough to attempt it. We need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him, we can't be playing side to side long balls all the effin time, like why is this kid not constantly starting?!!!!!
The biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
We pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
David is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment!!
Ten Hag is sacking himself! Playing Mctominay, keep starting Onana, not subbing off Bruno. Kmt. If he gets the sack, he deserves it  He can blame no one but himself. Kmt.
A lot of people don’t wanna hear it but Bruno ruins the team. It’s not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much. Either a terrible pass or a terrible shot. Occasionally he’ll slap a beauty but most of the time he’s a losing factor. Either way he’s way too risky. If you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position. His attitude stinks. Complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball. Or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in. Honestly he has to go. And mctominay 
Don’t get me started on mctominay
You’ll blame anyone and everyone other than Erik Ten Hag for the team he manages.
As you sit and listen to Mark defend ETH's job after this, just remember Mark unironically believed Manchester United would WIN the CL this season. He said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had.
If you go from believing we can win the competition, only to come 4th in a favourable group, then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable. 

ETH spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at LCB as an excuse for his ego trip with Varane and then tonight kept him at LCB while Evans played RCB. He constantly talks about standards but Onana, who has now led us to being the English team who has conceded the most goals in a CL group stage ever, got to play every game despite costing us points. The sooner this guy is gone the better.
I don’t see why we signed bayindir when he hasn’t played a game, surely he’s good enough to play cup games
They sanctioned Onana's  deal because they believed in Ten Hag who is now showing us how clueless he is we need to get rid of him with the immediate effect",17,Sports,1790000,PT39M41S

Sukuna is interested in the Executional Sword,so he tune down the slash to not kill them immediately.
Looking at the last panel, those slashes look like the normal version, not the existence cutting ones. Sukuna just said he's interested in the executioner's sword, so he might toy with higuruma a bit.
Yuji did something with that punch I just know it, it didn't seem like anything significant at the time but there's no way that those guys are surviving regular slashes when Ryo was turned into pork chops.
Not gonna lie Gege is the real sukuna😂😂
I don’t think it’s necessarily every slash of sukuna that can now cut the world,just the ones he chooses,probably these were his normal dismantle slashes
We didn't see maki intervening the fight. Our crew did calculated something wrong but i think they must've had another backup plan.
we'll learn that kusakabe is actually just him and his simple domain is simply built different
5:46 your wrong, that slashes are just a weaker version than the one that killed gojo, sukuna is probably just playing with them, just to intereste himself, since he wants to see higurumas sword!
I’m so excited because Hakari is back
When Yuji’s granddad said to die surrounded by the people he loved, he didn’t specify if they had to be alive. Yuji could die surrounded by the corpses of everyone in jujutsu high for all we know.
even if sukuna's CT got confiscated, he still has his cursed tools. damn, he comes prepared.
Bold speculation suggeting all of Sukunas attacks will only ever be the upgraded slashes and not something he toggles when he wants to use them.
God this one seriously takes me off guard, i really can't imagine what will happen because i can find no reason to our crew to not being cut in half, just sukuna's mood.
Hope they find a way cus i like so much all of the ones in the battlefield right now
no he is absolutely just going easy on the slashes. He could 100% just do that massive world cutting slash and end them all but he doesnt, he wants to fight since all the strongest sorcerers in the world are gathered in one place to fight him
Maan Gege ain't conceding anything regarding Sukuna lol. Every theory i had on how the fight will go depended on Sukuna losing Shrine. Add the Kenjaku shenanigans plus this and i can safely say i have no idea how any of this will go down.
With all that being said Hakari is a beast and Uraume better show us something!!
Good luck on your college exams my guy, thanks for the awesome video and leaks
I'm really hyped for the next chapter
I think the reason gege decided to take away the CT of the tool over the Slashes was because of Yuji. Yuji was stated to be a curse object soaked in Sukunas curse energy. Since we already saw how purple did less damage to gojo because it was his own attack, we can assume the same for Slashes to yuji. If he would have taken the slashes then yuji could have gotten one shotted by the curse tool made by a thousand binding vows.
Seeing a glimpse of the hakari fight was everything, THAT BOY BUILT DIFFERENTTTTTTT. Def looking forward to seeing what uraume does, there’s a reason why they’re so close to Sukuna and we will see why soon",24,Entertainment,64900,PT8M3S

Bon Appétit is a highly opinionated food brand that wants everyone to love cooking and eating as much as we do. We believe in seasonal produce, properly salted pasta water, and developing recipes that anyone can make at home.",248,"the passion this guy has... is incredible
I need to make a trip to New Orleans, the passion this guy has for his sandwiches and his business is heartwarming
What an amazing video. What an amazing vibe. What an amazing team and leader. I love everything about it!
Guy has that southern charm and is passionate, a real experienced GM out there hosting a show while actually helping the back of house.
“She come in looking for me, I knew she was looking for more than roast beef.” my dude had me dying 😂
This guy got to be one of the most infectious and energetic bosses out there! You can tell he truly has a passion for the food.
I am echoing what others have said .... this was a great video! Loved Justin's passion for their restaurant and the food they serve.
I always get the roast beef po-boy. I understand people that get the fried oyster or shrimp, but the roast beef is just the most sublime mess ever created.
There are so many places to get great po-boys in New Orleans, but I must say, Parkway's Surf & Turf (fried shrimp with roast beef debris and gravy) is in the upper echelon. 15 napkins minimum.
So living in New Orleans, this is my favorite po'boy place to go to! Especially for the streetcar poboy!!!! Thank you Bon Appetit for making this video and highlighting the behind the scenes of my favorite place!!
His passion for what he does is so evident.... I love watching people like him.
this place is brilliant, the guys is awesome. you can tell he aint BS, his staff must love him. Great episode!
Lived and worked in NOLA in kitchens. So much great food and Parkway has #1 poboys . Like the drive-up. Thats is a brilliant move.
justin's passion is infectious!! need me a po’boy asap
I grew up eating roast beef po' boys in southern Louisiana. Now I make them for my family and it's always a hit.
Incredible to see an owner operator so dialed in he even lives above the business to be more efficient. Will definitely visit in the future.
Looks delicious every sandwich 😋I would go there, just to try ""shrimp po boy"" ☺️Owner looks intense, like he wants to serve the best food,and runs a tight ship.👍
I want him to host a tv show based on his daily experiences in that store.
Loved how Justin weighed the sandwich and never skimped on anything. He just wants to make people happy... can't wait to go here one day!
As a restaurant person for over 20 years now working for somebody like this makes a huge difference. Great stuff!",24,Entertainment,6420000,PT21M9S

#Drumeo #NandiBushell #TwistedSister",1839,"Thank you so much @drumeo for inviting me on! I had the best time!
AJ Pero was a criminally underrated drummer.  Lots of people are unaware at how good he really was.
A great fresh version of a classic.

Her innocence when she says - I like how they all dressed up for the video.
Keep rocking, Nandi! Great work! 🙏🏼

she's 1000x better at this age then I'll ever be in my life.  So much talent and work
Absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer! It's truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age. I can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums. The precision, timing, and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable. A true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself!
She effin' killed it!  Her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing!  I was super impressed.  I'm not as surprised now, to see how Foo Fighters identified her skill... so long ago.  This was incredible.  No offense to Twisted Sister... but, I think she really turned it up to ""11"".
That was phenomenal. You can see how Nandi's taken all of the lessons from Chad Smith and Dave Grohl to heart. So happy to hear her keeping rock alive. I'd say her drums worked better in places than the original track, she had more fills and had some double kick in places. One of the best in this series.
This was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time. Beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 👏
Her talent just shines in this video.  What a great take on that song.
Her approach brings such a late 90s/early 00s pop-punk vibe to the whole song. If that version were released in that era, it still would have been a hit.
What I love about Nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is. You can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses. Makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that!
I love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hi-hat, that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when it's metal.
She is so impressive with not only how she plays, which is outstanding, but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly.
AJ is smiling down at this. Best series hands down. She's so effin talented 👏🏼👏🏼
Nandi is so awesome!!! What an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid. This was pure joy!!!
I gotta say….this was amazing! Nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before! WOW! Wow! Wow! 🤘🔥🙌🥁
I’m so psyched to see Nandi on here.  Love her drumming, love her energy, this is an amazing performance.  So many little things match up with her version and the original.  Can’t wait to see more of Nandi here!  I know the guys of Twisted Sister will love this.
Nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with Dave Grohl. I'm very impressed she's got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that don't overwhelm the overall song. Great work from her and I think once her GCSE's and A Levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one.
I like the way Nandi is already a better drummer than most 80s hair metal bands ever had.",27,Education,3310000,PT9M40S

Merci à :
Audrey Dussutour, chercheuse au Centre de recherche sur la cognition animale (CNRS, Toulouse), spécialiste du blobs et des fourmis
sa chaîne : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVE7VouRF078lVgX1rbUZKQ",679,"Appel à témoins : le docteur Nozman a disparu.
Dans son appartement on a découvert un énorme bloc…
Je trouve que les blob sont tellement impressionnant 😭
Je trouve cet organisme vraiment impressionnant et je pense qu'il aidera grandement la science ! (Notamment dans la médecine)
J'avais une question on voit souvent un blob ce développer   en 2D mais que ce passerait t'il dans une gelé ou un liquide mais plus volumique ?
Bonjour Nozman, petite anecdote, le record du plus long blob a été réalisé en France, plus précisément dans un lycée à Châteauroux. Plusieurs morceau de blob ont été aligné et une fois fusionné il mesurait plus de 53 m. Le record à été réalisé dans le lycée de blaise pascal. Je suis un ancien élève de ce lycée et j'aurai aimé participé à ce projet.
Sa fait trop plaisir de voir l’évolution de la chaîne je te suis depuis très longtemps ( les tuto faire du chew gum ,balle rebondissante , bonbon etc…) et depuis ce temps t vidéo sont toujours bien et instructive merci de nous divertir
Question : pourquoi 25 changements de boite petri et pas juste directement dans le grand bac ?? pour cahnger régulièrement la gélose ?
On rigole on rigole mais moi je croyais que c'était Norzman lui même qui ferait les illustrations dans ses vidéos 😂😭
c'est grace à ta première video que j'ai demandé un blob à noel, merci 💟
J'ai deux questions, la première est peut-être due à mon manque d'attention mais j'ai la flemme de chercher le moment où c'est expliqué dans la vidéo. En gros, pourquoi ne pas l'avoir directement mis dans la plus grande boîte ?
La deuxième, vous vous êtes attachés à lui un peu ? ^^'
Il y a tellement de travail derrière une vidéo merci à toi et à ton équipe.
C'est incroyable la façon dont il grandi et il est intelligent en plus😲
Vidéo excellente, rythme et voix reposante, c'était fantastique, merci à l'équipe... la science n'attends pas...
j'ai quand même une petite question : pourquoi ne pas le mettre directement dans une grande boîte ? Pour que l'on puisse voir le développement ou parce que le blob en a besoin ?
Je conseille vivement les conférences d'Audrey Dussutour, spécialiste du blob. C'est instructif et drôle aussi.
Cette vidéo est vraiment un pure produit du divertissement 😂
Super intéressant comme toujours, je me demandais si tu a donner ton blob ou si tu l'avais congelé
Trop bien la vidéo, tant le contenu que le montage ! Je me demande la taille max que ça peut atteindre
En tout cas plein de bonnes choses à vous
J’aime comment tu parle, avec douceur et avec des mots spécifique, surtout quand tu explique le phénomène dont parle, tu y va avec profondeur dans le terme d’explication continue ce que tu fait y’a tout le monde qui te regarde et qui attende à chaque fois une nouvelle vidéo❤❤
Géniale vidéo ! J'ai moi même plusieurs blobs chez moi depuis plusieurs mois, ils se portent à merveille. C'est FASCINANT !! continue tes vidéos, j'adore ❤",28,Science & Technology,4590000,PT21M34S

#pokemon #legendarypokemon #infinitefusion",532,"Pokemon fusions are one thing, but the fact things like Deoxys and Regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
The only thing I regret is not fusing more Legendaries with Magikarp
I actually like this „twist” to a fusions playthrough, because we get to see the cooler/rarer fusions
No chance John wins that champion battle without Tyler, he really saved the day
The miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now. Tysm John and Tyler for putting this in
I Love that John still names his Requazas Gregory after that epic JMC episode in Season 1. 
I also love how John plays this game we all know Legends are the most fun to fuse XD
9:35 Loving the Ben 10 reference with this one. Been rewatching it this week for the first time since I was a kid AND just finished my first ever Infinite Fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a Chronosapien/Clockwork reference in this Fangame! I hope you do more videos on it!
PM7 providing top notch quality videos right when I’m about to eat lunch. Lovely!
I love all the screams Tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
""How can you follow up Giratina Square""
Lance: another one
Roger is one of my favourite fusions I've seen across all Infinite Fusion content! Love the videos John!
That Raikou/Hydreigon is so sick! That could definitely be a boss battle in Dark Souls or something.
I've always wanted to play Infinite Fusion but just have never found the time, it's nice to see someone exploring all the fun Legendary Fusions!
I can't believe it, he actually evolved Feesh. Raydos might look awesome, but it'll never recapture the image of Rayeesh
I seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 😂
LET""S GO!!!! Clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurk/dialga fusion!
25:31 That just about killed me.
It's never too late to do a playthough of a game! I've seen lots of Infinite Fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it! Really looking forward to the next part!
Also, I think the catch rate might be higher in this game (or fluctuate depending on the fusion) but I was still left in suspense at all the captures!
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end, but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level, so you dont see slugma's and pichu's in the elite 4
Super happy you're planning to do another video on this game! I'm a spriter for the game and I'd love to see you use some of my Legendary fusions! They won't be in the game until January though due to the update schedule for sprites",20,Gaming,819000,PT35M47S

#UFC",2367,"The fact that Wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
Always rooting for Wonderboy. He’s a great role model, love seeing him teach the kids karate.
If the UFC made a show about Wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome I'd never miss an episode
Thompson is unreal... he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
This was one of the most positive and happy embedded I've seen! Happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week. They'll need it for the presser
Such a heartwarming embedded. Even someone I’m not a fan of like Paddy, he’s a good dude at heart. Good to see.
I'm proud of wonderboy's facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight, but ensuring that they get their homework done.
Wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act. It’s honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
1:23 I respect Wonderboy so much🥋💯. He knows to his core all his skills took time, years & years of honing. What he’s teaching these children & by simply picking them up from school? A world class fighter!!! You have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds. We all got in this art from watching movies. I can’t imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training🙌🏾🙌🏾🥋🥋🥋💯💯💯
Since everyone is talking about how great Wonderboy is…. 

Right after the Luque fight, I ran into him at Disneyland. I was a single rider on the Smuggler’s Run ride, and ended up with him and his family. I was so stoked! I told him my wife can’t ride because she is with my 2 year old son, and he said “well, you’re part of our family for this ride now!”

After the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son. He was seriously the nicest guy I’d ever met! It was something I’ll never forget.
Wonderboy really is that dude. Great human being
Why can’t Wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years?… he’s one of the nicest guys on the planet, and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
The fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing I’ve ever seen
We need more fighters like Wonderboy in gyms everywhere. A good man is hard to find.
Brandon Royval and Stephen Thompson seem like genuinely good guys/role models. Really nice to see that.
Paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell he's a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan ❤
I’m rooting for Royval and Edwards! 
But it ain’t going to be easy 😤
What a great card to end the year.
Paddy’s honestly a great dude. Fighter or not, the guys got my admiration.
I know UFC doesn't wanna take the focus away from their Fight Night cards, but you really should build up these big PPV events for more than just a week. Hype usually takes a bit of time to build properly.
Wonderboy has always been a treat on embedded, he's a true role model of what a martial artist should be, he's so humble, true class act 👏👏👏👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT8M43S

The ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’ star and his wife worked with AD100 powerhouse Nate Berkus to design a beautiful and comfortable home, perfect for hosting their expanding family as two of their four children prepare to get married. Moving away from the mid-century Americana styles you’d typically find around Palm Springs, Berkus took inspiration from Italian country homes, creating a more muted space with all the charm of the Italian countryside. Before letting Berkus and Anna take the reigns on design, Ray only had a few specific requests for his new desert oasis. “I wanted some kind of cozy feel to it. That’s all. I was very vague,” he says. “And I fell in love with a bunk bed room that we saw at the Ritz-Carlton in Sundance that my kids stayed in. And I said, ‘I want a room like that.’”

ABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST
The leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.",205,"Ray Romano has been one of my favourite comedians over the last 25 years. He is so effortlessly funny and seems like a humble guy.
Overall perfect. The couple. The jokes. The ambients. The Design. The Location. Love him even more now 😂
His ""cozy"" house being bigger than the house I see in my dreams is crazy 😢. He's a funny, unproblematic non controversial guy tho who deserves everything he has.
Maybe my favorite AD to date- being livable and lavish is hard to pull off. Bravo.
OKAY this is the MOST honest interview and tour ever! Of course  ❤ shoutout to Nate too 😊
I love that his wife is just as witty as him.
I'd love to see Nate Berkus do a tour and talk about his design choices.
How beautiful 🌿 Well done Nate 😊👍🦋
Now I wish they had a youtube channel so we can get a glimpse of their lovely family.
I unexpectedly watched the whole video with my face crinkled up and a giant open mouthed grin on my face. I'm not sure why it was unexpected, he is hilarious, and so is she.
Love how simple and cozy it is
I love the kitchen 🧡What a lovely couple. the thing that makes it special. she was with him when he had nothing before the fame so you know, their love is real.
Now this is a really, really nice house.
WOW ❤ so modern, simple and clean 😍
Beautiful! Loved every bit of it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That view out of the back of the house is crazy! WOW.
Great video because the hosts were so entertaining!!! More of these please
I agree with Ray, the bunk bed room is my favourite too. Beautiful house!
This is probably my favorite house I've seen on AD. Simple yet very beautiful and practical.
i did not stop smiling!  love the house.  😊love this couple even more!  please, someone, give them a show.  i am so there!  anna - you are fabulous!",24,Entertainment,6400000,PT12M46S

The fact blue think he doesn't rap off beat is crazy. And the fact he thinks we can really name 3 of his songs is even more crazy
Marco is very tactical. Not your average comedian. Interviewer. Influencer. Nothing lol.
If you watch this with no sort of bias against blueface, he and Marco are truly just hilarious idiots😂😂😂
It never fails! Every time Marco gives you a compliment he follows it with a diss ! “I think you smart and can do a lot of things. So why can’t you rap on beat?”😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
He done took them sunglasses onnand off fifty million times 😂😂😂😂😂
Marco’s face when blueface said “I’ve never had that hairstyle” 😂
Their personalities mix very well😂😂😂😂 I was weak the whole time 💯
That man said “ name 3 bluface songs rn.” He really responded with “or I die?” 😂😂😂😂😂
Let me roll up THIS shit gon be HILARIOUS😂😂😂
The crumpled 100 when Blueface was talking having to fight 4 ppl was a great touch 😂😂😂
Two statements, I took to be genuinely useful:

“You don’t have to be good at anything. You just have to be good at trying“

“it’s a partnership. The wins are doubled and the losses are split.”
Marco will literally go down in history for these interviews.. I'm over here screaming 😂
Marco is the GOAT for this!!!! The fact that Marco could name 2 is AMAZING ! I was struggling with one !
Comedians really are a gift to depression 😭
Blue- “I’ve never had that hairstyle”💇‍♂️ 
Marco- “🙂” 

The way I busted out laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂  I know Marco wanted to laugh fr
Blueface is a great sport, he definitely had the personality for tv and shit 😂😂😂
It takes a strong man to do these interviews with these types of people…I salute you Marco
Love Marco for how confident and quick he was to defend that target hat😂
Marco has a very unique personality. He knows how to keep people on his toes. And the way his conversations flow is crazy. It's definitely a mindset thing for sure ❤",24,Entertainment,447000,PT32M48S

FYI, there is also passive income if you buy the tow truck and the wall safe upgrade, so keep in mind. Avoid the staff upgrade unless you have spare money, so keep in mind. Should work like the one in the Auto Shop. This comment is for beginners only
I got my eyes on the new Mustang... Finally... a proper modern Mustang...
Just done the Cayo Perico start to finish (exactly the same way Taco does it) and I only noticed one small change. 
It the intel gather mission, when you steal the plane to fly to the island, the driver side door is no longer stuck open. This is excellent for my OCD 😂
I regret choosing the most expensive location. Hard to get into shop, gang attack could spawn, and cars don’t always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the MOC to have the led´s from the Christmas Truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 Here is your Weekly Update video including all of the things added in the Winter DLC ""Chop Shop"" What do you think of this new DLC so far? More vids coming throughout the day!
Prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane.
The Range Rover was on my very short list along with the Escalade V and that 96 Impala SS was an AMAZING surprise but I'm still hurt about no new   Dubsta AKA G55/63... it's got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community. The Turismo and the chop shop are the only things I'll have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me.
The new Grotti drives so damn nice! Liking the new Declasse Impaler LX but I just love them type of muscle cars anyway. The Vigero ZX and Dominator are pretty cool but I still prefer the roof up. Best feature so far... The garage organizer!
The vehicle prices are crazy 😂 I wish it was more like real life
Tuner update and Chop Shop are my fav so far, love the low grips and manual stick!
So far so good this is a solid DLC it's a W from me still would have liked to have a heist with this DLC as well but it's all good.
Top tier. I appreciate the time and effort put into the vids 🤙🏿

Another change that I noticed on PS is, when you fire the Avenger turrets, it changes to a different turret, they made it the same button
Well, I actually like the interaction menu updates. There are less items in each category now. Makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier. Will this change speed runs?
I’m probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle, but I’m hyped that we can get the Cluckin Bell Van and omg the Baller S-TD only Rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
Done my first complete salvage mission. Start to finish took almost 2 hours (without knowing what the heck I was doing mind) and made GTA$350,000 from it. 
Not the worst business by a long shot and I’m sure we’ll all get quicker at doing them. 
It was great fun. They’re like mini heists with intel gathering, setup missions and tasks (4 mandatory and 2 optional) and then the final steal mission. Mine was Maze Bank Arena. It was brilliant",20,Gaming,112000,PT12M52S

What a player🤍
Really happy forJoselu❤
Union were in every UCL match this season. Unfortunately, they gave up late goals in many of them.
Im a rm fan but how is Joselus first goal allowed? He literally had his whole arm around the player
how did RM find joselu. bro is just like benz. perfect striker.
I think Ronnow has proved he's too good for this struggling Union Berlin team.
Have no idea why still using full team instead of youngsters for this match
That was a foul on the defender for Madrids first
Dani Ceballos i feel bad for him. he scores the winning goal at almost 90th minute and his mates are barely celebrating with him. He needs time to fit in the new squad.
Joselu ❤❤❤ Eres una maquiladora, solo necessities mas opotunidades,, gracias amigo

One of my favorite foods of all times. A bodega Jamaican beef patty is pure comfort. But knowing the home version is made by the hands of a New Yorker, I feel this is very well validated.
Let me tell you, as someone from the Carribean who eats patties regularly, I was actually kinda gitty that it appeared in such a great big movie. Also even tho I am not Jamaican, it’s still the best patties. Especially the crispy flaky ones 😋
Jamaican patties are also quite common here in Costa Rica. We Costa Ricans call them ""patí"" here, and we make them with either ground beef or chicken. 

We also add it hot pepper. And definitely our patties do NOT have cheese, especially that American cheese that is not even real cheese.
It’s definitely great to see Babish handle a true Jamaican delicacy.
i found that dipping cheesy beef patties in oxtail gravy is out of this world
I've had a Jamaican patty made with a nice tender ground lamb. Absolutely wonderful
When I was kid in Harlem, some pizza parlors would also put pepperoni and mozzarella inside upon request.  Also as the years go by, I’ve been more of a chicken patty guy. 😋
One of my favorite things to do with the store bought beef patties is to carefully split them open after cooking and add some irish cheddar. I know you can buy them with beef and cheese filling, but you can't buy them with my favorite cheese.
This is the first bwb episode I've watched since the interview he did on mythical kitchen and I burst into tears when I heard him do the intro
I’m not Caribbean in any way shape or form but spicy beef patties are one of my favorite foods ever. Can eat them all day, every day.
as a Jamaican, and growing up with these things, I am so happy to see it catch on in America. Beef patties are everything, crunchy, soft, creamy, spicy. Its nice seeing the love.
I used to get so excited when they served these for lunch in elementary school. The lunch ladies were so nice because they would give me two knowing I would only eat the inside 😅
You are right, finding the suet is way harder then locating pre-made beef patties.  It is totally worth the effort though, fresh made beef patties are amazing.
I love everything that is coming out of the Babish Universe, but the nostalgia I feel when you make a classic video like this <3 can't be beat. thanks for sharing :)
I had never had these until they caught my eye at the grocery store the other day in the frozen section. And now I can't stop. My only question is what would happen if you deep fried them
As a Jamaican, I feel so recognized. Thanks Andrew
You did this justice! I grew up eating beef patties at my dad's deli all the time and it's still to this day my guilty pleasure. They look great!
Seeing the one food from my family's island home has lighten me up! As someone whose family is literally from the Island of Jamaica, this made me extremely excited! Thank you, Babish <3
I have recently found out that I love jamaican beef patties. They are so flavorful and hit the spot. They are one of my go to lunches when I am working from home.",22,People & Blogs,10100000,PT8M10S

What a player. The defense of bayern was really good today.
I wish Mane worked at Bayern so they would have a front 3 of Sane Kane Mane
Kim Min Jae is world class. What a performance 👏👏
Davies is like the Gordan Murray T50 car
Ten Hag might be the first manager to win MOTM and a month later getting sacked
Congrats Man U for making the top 4 🎉
Badly missed old those days with Sir Alex Ferguson. Man Utd had a terrible performance, not being able to complete even 10 passes, so disappointing to see how Man utd performing poorly in the field. As a life-long Man Utd fan, I must admit that I suffer from poor management and lack of responsibility from the club executives!
You gotta feel for ten Hag. Their shape looked better after halftime instruction only for them to fall back into disorganization and being pushed wide and pressed again. 
Seems to me like Man U strangles the creativity right out of players! To coach with a club culture like that must be tough. 
That being said Bayern, looks like a strong team AGAIN...
""This is Football Heritage."" --- Jose Mourinho
Ronaldo must be loving every minute of this highlight . Especially when the cameras focus on management 😂
since 1980 i ve never seen a goalkeeper that stay at his line on one on one 😡😡😡..its like an invitation to the other player to score 😩😩
Kane.World Class. Bravo.
Onana moving backwards on a 1-on-1 loool…😂
Anthony, one of the most useless signing in Man. Utd's history
5:49 Sane (left side) already knew Coman would score haha
Did anything happen in this game? Champions league group stage matches are so often mismatches with Bayern playing against these small teams at the bottom of the CL standings.
Bayern will have a loophole if they lose Davies ! They better extend his contract
mans is built different 😤
Goretzka should be congratulated for Bayern's victory !!! If you look at the replay , it was the hard work of Goretzka to keep control of the ball while under pressure from Man. U. defense and make a good pass which resulted in the excellent pass by Kane to Coman for the winning goal !!!

I seen very few games that I never get bored of. Truly a master piece. Thanks a lot supercell.
Adding hero equipment is such a good idea! I’m glad the devs found a way to make attacking more interesting and interactive without having to make it too complex
Just saw the patch notes, They changed the power potion effect from laboratory level to townhall level, This means you don't have to make lab your priority after upgrading to a newer townhall 🔥
*Loved everything so far but maybe a alternative TH defense would be better next time rather than the 4th remake of giga-inferno*
Wish we could still have the stat progress bars so you could see how the new equipment progresses with each upgrade relative to the maxed stats
I really love the update, specially the Nature sheme it looks so awesome but I it would've be alot better if the Townhall would do a massive earthquake when troops comes near it than this lame inferno weapon. But yeah thats my opinion.
to give a significant role to the walls now, they could start doing damage to troops, since they have fire, pikes or eletricity
I’m glad the hero abilities stayed at the right level good job supercell greatest update I’ve been present for
Edit: I do wish the blacksmith was elixir to upgrade instead of gold
I love how it’s straight to the point
I like when they add both new content for max players and some stuff for us mid-townhall players too
Been saying hero skins need to come with varying abilities for years now.. glad they finally made a way to have hero’s “adjustable”
What I think is that we were getting a free upgrade on our hero abilities by upgrading our heroes but now we have to extra grind for them separately 😅😅
The new troop is absolutely devastating it really opens up the base
Part of COC since a decade 🥺
Lots of love waiting for update as quick as possible ❤❤
One of the biggest updates ever. Never bored clashing. Way to go Team!! 👏
The Giant Arrow is so fun.

Its Hitbox might be a bit big though. It hits stuff that it doesn’t even come close to visually touching. A 0.5 tile radius would be more fitting to the visual and might help temper it’s power a bit.
Loved it ❤Wow such a upgraded version we awaiting 😊 Amazing 🎉

I'm an American and I must say, the Wales family are a breath of fresh air.
I really love how George and Charlotte and Louis work together to help their mother pack and carry things! It's very rare for me to see something like this! And the first time I saw this video, I feel extraordinary closeness and warmth in the Welsh family ❤ thanks for sharing this video!
If all parents took their time to educate their children like this we would have a better world!!!
This is really a great initiative! We would like also to inform everyone that we collected thousands of 9O off codes for this month. Make sure to get some.
This is so wonderful. Catherine teaching her children at a young age to give back. I love that they took boxes out of their car to give as well.
Catherine is a great teacher to her children…simple as that!  Just having them aware of other human beings, like themselves.
This is such a wonderful, caring video.  Princess Catherine bringing her children to volunteer helping with the huge job of sorting of dividing the donations for families in need.  Not only have they learned the positive lesson of volunteering, but more importantly, they are learning about the thousands of children and families who are struggling and will be so happy to receive this loving outpouring of support from their communities during the holidays. The Wales children are caring and loving just like their wonderful parents.  💖
Got very emotional watching how down to earth the Wales family are. Catherine PRINCESS of Wales emits beauty from within.
The interactions between herself the children, and the people surrounding her 
Is genuine and regal. 
💕The children are so naturally well behaved. May God bless them. The Wales family is built on solid foundations and stability.
How can you not love this family❤️ Kudos to the Prince and Princess of Wales for raising well adjusted children! They are doing an amazing job!
Love how “ George wants to come back”! Yes momma, train them to serve and care about others!
The fact that the children behave so well and so politely is all due to their parents.
Great mother, great wife, and great future Queen of the UK. Princess Catherine works hard to carve out her own roles and create her own style of doing things. It is never ""look at me, ain't I a great humanitarian;"" we can see her humility, dedication, steadfastness of purpose, and tremendous hard work. Thank you Catherine; we are lucky to have you and your family.
What a wonderful mother teaching her children the value of giving back to others and recognizing those in need. There is not a greater gift than compassion for others, and while I am sure Catherine and William teach many private lessons on selflessness at home, it is good to see George, Charlotte and Louis in action. No doubt these children will live lives of service and respect for all.
The Wales children are absolutely wonderful!!!  So are their parents.
Catherine is an amazing mum. Educating her children to show respect and compassion for others who have far less than they do.  The royal children do it so carefully and considerately. They are an inspiration. ❤
So wholesome. A great example for everyone.
👩🏻‍💻It is so good to see Catherine, the Princess of Wales taking her children and teaching them to serve. I got my kids to plan and prepare a meal to give to one a family having a new baby. When they learn to serve when they are young the children grow to be empathic and compassionate and to look around outside themselves. It is so good to see such an excellent example of guiding her children and being a leader for the world.

What a simple message - to get out there and help, in any way!  It is good to see the future royals learning how to help.  In the US, we have a few organizations, one is Toy for Tots.  Police Dept's , Fire Dept's all get involved, as do individuals to help out.    There are many other organizations too:  for single parents, for runaway teens, for the animals, and those in hospitals - so many ways to get involved -   :)
Ik they're being filmed, but that literally brought tears to my eyes how cute those kids are and what a nice thing they'e doing.  It's so great that the princess of wales includes her children in these charities.  And actually a great idea to have them pick out the toys for kids their age.",22,People & Blogs,659000,PT1M51S

Thank you for making my home feel safe again! Love and miss you guys!

I do not allow any negative energy or spirits or anything else to come around me or anyone I love while watching these videos. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything yall do
I am really glad that Colby decided to say his fear out loud because I've been struggling with the same one for the last few years. It's nice to know someone out there is also feeling uneasy because of this.. makes me feel less alone.
Honestly, Colby is so real for having that fear. It's definitely one you don't really think about, but most of us probably have.
Wildlife biologist here! That hissing in the shack sounded like an opossum to me :) other animals like marmots will hiss like that (a gutteral hiss, not the silkiness of a snake hiss). It was probably looking for bugs or rodents and upset you disturbed its hunt. ❤
Imagine being a ghost and seeing the bathtub full of water and getting all excited to take yourself a little ghostly soak so you turn the jets on and suddenly everyone freaks out 🤣
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video and i dont want this to be spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching series thank you so much for listening to our side of the story
Me, my family and my loved ones do not claim any negative energy or spirits from the video. I am praying that all of you guys watching the video will stay safe and protected!

Am I the only one who was so engrossed and entertained watching them together, that when they pulled the curtain back and Sam jumped up (even though I KNEW something silly was about to happen) I still literally jumped, screamed, and then laughed so freakin hard at myself!! No? Just me?? Lmao.
Celina, I’m really glad you’re bringing the people who are sensitive to certain things into a positive light. I’ve been struggling with my gift since I was little and it regularly scares me some people don’t get how it effects people. Shit sucks sometimes. I’ve been following you for years and I’m proud of you. I’m still afraid to address my shenanigans even though multiple mediums have read me and called me out. Fun fact I grew up in a house in Maine with shadow people. Yes that is plural unfortunately. My mom can attest to that one it was Terrifying. this video is full of goofy sh!t tho
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits, or anything else to come around me or the one's i love while watching this series thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything you do. I'm sorry if i nade any glances or anything i shouldn't have.
Guys! I felt the energy off that banishing ritual! Powerful stuff! As a witch (and a fellow ghost investigator), I'm giving you all virtual high-fives! Ya did good!
This video is refreshingly lighthearted and wholesome after the Conjuring series.  Always love a collab between the boys and Kris and Celina!  I could watch these goofy besties just hanging out for hours",24,Entertainment,11100000,PT57M20S

These guys really push the limit of what’s possible
So happy to see YouTube sponsoring this video! You definitely deserve it, so proud of how far you've come. Hope you take the time to appreciate what you've built now and then.
I bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign, and it's absolutely amazing. I used it for a few hours on the 4th of July and had no issues. I didn't even have to refill it
Oh my Sweet Celestia I love the logo design with aperture science.

And I'd say it's accurate because you guys are the embodiment of ""Science is about WHY NOT?!""

Also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
Fun personal experience: for about a year, I worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with Class 10 clean rooms. No perfume, cologne, makeup, or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there. And no skin exposed. Everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed, and goggles that even had small air filters in them.

James I've gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode. This episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that I've been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today. I sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team. Def bought a mini-sabre too.😊
Not a starwars fan. More of a pirates of the caribbean guy. But I loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic. It's an amazing project, with an amazing team!
I know no one will see this, but I just want to say how amazing you guys are. From your Garage to the H.E.R.C facility I've watched every video. I've forgotten how long or at what amount of people I subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago. But I want to thank you guys for everything you're doing, pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers, chemists, physicists and rocket scientists. Keep up the amazing work, can't wait for the 'We Amputated this Guy's Limbs and turned him into Darth Vader' video. But seriously, you guys are awesome.
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists. been watching for a very long time (around 4 years). GOODLUCK HACKSMITH!
I am curious as to how they'll manage sabers clashing. It's been long theorized(and more or less confirmed in rebels) that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact. Maybe they'll be able to utilize something to that regard?
I love how casually he said ""let's play with liquid oxygen"" immediately after telling us how dangerous it is. Exactly what I'd expect from a sci-engineering/infotainment channel.
How far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
While watched you earlier you were just making Marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
Now , the hacksmith is like an industry
Too happy for you my man
Keep going
Hacksmith is doing something, that even large companies wouldn't do. Big respect
The team at Hacksmith Industries actually do things that most people don’t even think of. It’s crazy 🤯.
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational. Maybe you're less stressed now or something, but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends.
I truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility. You can see engineering past, present and future in your labs.
You guys are awesome and are living the dream. So happy that you are allowing all us nerds this awesome experience, hope everything continues to go well!",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT16M51S

Oh man, the hotel analogy is too true! All the new luxury apartments in LA have these tiny units with windows on only one side going for $5,000/mo rent, and when you open your front door, instead of being outside, you're in a (depressingly artificially lit) hallway. Each time I left a tour of a new apartment I thought to myself ""I want to live somewhere that feels like a home, not somewhere that feels like a hotel - and certainly not for $5,000/mo."" Now I understand why I always had that feeling.
Given that Switzerland has the lowest fire deaths per capita and no limit on the height of single stair buildings I am totally comfortable doing away with the rule altogether.
I've watched A LOT of apartment videos (Never Too Small, Apartment Therapy, House & Home etc.) and in a million years I never would have guessed that the apartment at 10:07 was in Seattle. My first thought would have been somewhere in Europe or Latin America. 

I've gotten so used to seeing a certain layout in modern buildings in North America and I didn't realise it was window/staircase related until now. This video was such a fresh take and it's so interesting to see certain cities taking a different approach. Thanks for doing what you're doing!
Living in a Chicago walkup (and most buildings on my block being the same, roughly 3-4 stories) this staircase issue seems to be somewhat alleviated by having outdoor staircases attached at the back on the building. This being said, almost all Chicago blocks have alleyways in addition to the street so access is easier than other cities. Added bonus: Each unit in my building has a small outdoor space on the staircase landing where people set up small bistro sets, grills, and outdoor furniture in a mini patio setup. Not ideal, but my building was built in the 90s so compatible with the current building codes.
it's funny because a german youtube channel just did a video on why german cities are so ugly, and some aren't. It was because after the second world war there were some that re-built as it used to be while others built for the car. Nowadays, the cities that built for the car are wide open spaces with some boxy buildings, lots of concrete, that have to adhere to strict laws that govern everything but looks. Older cities are more human-sized with lit ped zones and people are around which gives a sense of security
There was one more thing not mentioned in the video. Firefighters in Europe have cars with ladders to evacuate people. Even in smaller towns, those ladders reach about 30 metres, which is enough which is enough for 8 floors. And apartments are built so that each apartment is a separate fire compartment and the fire doesn't spread to and from the apartment.
It's telling that even Australia has looser single stair rules than North America, when they are so similar in sprawl and development to Canada and to a lesser extent the USA.
Good stuff. Canada and Vancouver especially way over regulated and are full of silly rules that limit development and make building more time consuming and more expensive. Keep making this kind of content!’
Wow. I've been wondering why every single apartment building going up in my city has at most 2 bedroom apartments and why they're all the size of an entire city block with a ""hotel"" layout. I love older style row houses, I never understood why they aren't being built anymore.

As you mentioned, because it's so hard to get enough land together to bother building a modern apartment building, my city is always pushing developers to go at least 8-10 stories or more. If you're going to bother acquiring the land may as well build as much as possible because that building is going to be there for 50-100 years. I understand the logic, but I'd rather see a ton of 4 story row houses, that only require 0.05 acres of land.
In Belgium, apartment buildings also require two separate fire escapes, but one of them can be a window. Ladder access is required unless a fire truck can easily reach it. This explains why the two-stairs rule starts at 6 floors, that's simply the highest our biggest ladder trucks can reach.
The fire department always checks building plans before they get planning permission and local governments will basically always follow their advice. So depending on the place, there can be stricter limits. Buildings with a higher fire risk like student dorms for example always have stricter fire regulations.
Man, these are great videos! I really hope some people with power see these and start making better decisions and policies and become willing to take calculated risks rather than follow the status quo that most of them, unfortunately, do. You’re doing everyone in the AEC industry and the general public a tremendous service!
It is possible to design a small apartment building with two staircases, one in front and one in the back. I lived in apartments in both St Louis and Madison with them. A college friend who moved to Chicago also lived in one. I've also rented couple apartments that had the front staircase inside and the back outside. I admit it's uncommon, but it's not impossible. All these buildings were pre-WWII though. The problem is greedy developers, not apartment design.
As an architect in Vancouver I can confirm stairs are not the limiting factor. The cost of construction is so expensive that developers can’t make money off smaller buildings. That’s why they build larger condo buildings so their percentage of sellable area is higher.
This is such an interesting video. I've never heard of this. I wonder if this will be discussed more as housing continues to climb, and I wonder if there's any implications with birthrate. If no one can find multi-bedroom apartments, that's a major pressure on families.
Part of the reason we built our cities with wood housing is because when we were building our modern cities we still had a lot of timber we could use where many european countires had already used a lot of their woodlands. Also Brick and stone dont do great in many of our more seismically active areas.
I was sceptical to if it's really all about the staircases but you have me convinced. I never thought about how much a hallway ruins a building
Excellent content and thanks for illuminating these issues so that hopefully it can spark discussion on how to more effectively deal with our housing crisis.
I grew up in a sort of archology here in Canada where every apartment had two floors, with entrances on both floors, it was a 4 storey building in some spots, and sometimes the twisting hallways led to doors that you would think are doors to more tunnels/exits/pool areas/garages, but it led into a persons upstair hallway by accident.  We could go thru tunnels between the 3 buildings, so in winter we could go swimming without ever going outside. It was amazing.
I would also like to note that the reason why Greece and Finland have the highest fire deaths per capita as shown in the chart, is namely because Greece and Finland are heavily forested countries, with Greece having multiple forest fires in a summer (nothing to do with housing), and also because wood is used often in rural Finnish structures (but they are always single story).",22,People & Blogs,126000,PT12M10S

Lyrics
I told you I’d rise up
 
You’d be mistaken if you thought I was gone
Cause I’ve been waiting for this moment too long (Whoa)
Just to see the worry in your eyes
 
I bet you thought that I had fallen away
It never crossed your mind that there’d be a day (whoa)
I’d return to look you in the eyes
 
Don’t pray for me, You said there’s no hope in forgiving
Your happy to just leave me for the dead
Well time has passed I’m very much the living
And all that’s left is to leave you seeing red 
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.
 
I don’t believe that you have got any soul
You’re just a breed of your own kind all alone (Whoa)
An architect of your own decline
 
Nothing’s sacred anymore that’s the past
Its falling further even more out of grasp (Whoa)
You’re replaced and running out of time
 
No prayers from me, you see I’m not the one you think will
Just let it go and leave it all behind
You’re dead to me and I don’t even feel guilt
Just take a look cause it’s time for me to rise
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.
 
I don’t want to close my eyes
I can never get enough
Like the sun it’s time that I rise up
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.

I cannot believe you are going to retire when you can still release so many more bangers. I know you have your very valid personal reasons but damn, what the world is going to miss is incredible. Thank you for all these years, this last album is turning out absolutely spectacular, you will go with a bang. ❤
This is definitely a very ""sum 41 song"". Somehow they manage to make this music in-between metal-ish pop punk vibe. Can't wait to listen to the rest of the album
Omg this song is so good !! I don’t believe it. To put scream in a sum41 song might be a first no ? 😮 and the clip is so fun I m glad seeing the sums having fun together 🎉 cheers 🍻

Omg Ms Tate should get into making ASMR as a side gig she would KILL it
okay but the jacket sounds are SOO relaxing?? she killed this 💫
i really appreciate that she took asmr seriously. it’s so annoying and rude when other celebrities don’t

I remember watching videos of her original songs when I was 9 or 10 and now I’m about to be 17. She’s made it so far and she deserves everything she has and more. She’s great at ASMR too
I haven’t listened to her in years but she’s grown so much! were almost 2 years apart, but I still feel like a proud mother💀 gonna stream her albums!
She's so good at it, and the candle lighting portion with the words of reassurance. The smirk and eye roll saying ""Relax"", I am now convinced shes watched some ASMR before.
This is such a good asmr video, she seems so natural at it. Got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough 😅
She needs to make her own asmr broo the crispiness of her whispers and binaural technique is so good
I am BEGGING for whoever edits these videos to make the part where they do ASMR with the W Magazine longer. it is so satisfying and one of my fav parts but always gets cut short
WOW this is cool she not only has a great singing voice she has a incredible whispering voice so soothing and soft fabulous T-McRae she impresses in every way..all the time so talented love it...

 #gaming #lego #fortnite",583,"EXTRA TIP: Carry 6 planks with you ALWAYS. You can 1. Craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools (including the grappler which makes it actually useful) or 2. craft a bed once you get to the right town level, which as already stated is good for respawns (alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you)
Hiya Guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold😅

*Regarding Tip 12 with the Grappler*
Thank you everyone for the comments i wasn't aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 🤣
It may get patched soon though...

Really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code ""RUGG"" in the item shop!
Thank you all so much for the support 😎
More LEGO Fortnite videos will be coming later this week
MAJOR TIPS, READ THIS!
Something to keep in mind, if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest, it resets the grappler back to 10 uses. It makes the grappler very work getting.

Another tip, if you take the barrels of TNT (found near old broken down buildings)  and throw them into clusters of trees, or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while i’m only at 3rd village lvl. great video as always!
For heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
If you keep a hearty charm on, it can negate low temp or high temp damage. You remain at full HP, you get the temp hearts. So long as your at the first layer of hot/cold, the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts.
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10. It usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used. I also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return. Edit: just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up.
Suggestion: I explored my map a bit with nothing on me. Whenever I came across something interesting I would pick up small stones nearby, make a marker and place it there. That way I could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything. Then whenever I'm ready I'd gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that I can immediately go to.
Great tip with the grappler, you don't have to break the chest, put it in and take it out, unfortunately not the same for tools
As of now, when it comes to dying of starvation, heat, or cold, there is a way to negate all of them with one item. It allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though I took fire damage the entire time. There is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if you're already full health, and it regenerates itself very quickly, meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation, heat, or cold, it'll regenerate it self. This allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game, especially in regards to those desert caves.
MORE TIPS: 1. Instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools, just craft a “traditional counter” under “counters” as it only costs 8 wood. 

2. The grappler’s uses can be refreshed just like your tools, except it’s even easier. You don’t even need to break whatever chest/counter you’ve built. Just throw it in a storage thing, take it out, and it’s refreshed.
Thanks for the great tips.

My tip is for people starting a new server in Survival, set up a different server with the same seed in Sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town.
I actually would suggest making a grappler. It got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit👍 7:51
I don’t know if anyone said this yet but you don’t actually need cool headed charms for the desert, if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you don’t lose your temporary hearts, and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back.
You can find sand shells at the beach/tropical coast areas. Access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations.
CRAFT THE GRAPPLER! it only sucks because it has 10 uses, but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell, the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as there’s so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse, make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
#2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime. its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly.
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect.
Heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers (assign them to threading) if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
I would say it’s for sure worth making the grappler, just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land. You can do the durability glitch w/ the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when You’re fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
Fun fact: You can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out. + aim at the highest point of a tree and it’ll work perfectly with the glider!",20,Gaming,287000,PT9M16S

Most brain dead defenders of this game are like, it's not a scam, you got a 'product'.  Yes, when I buy Chevy Camero and they give me a Ford Festiva, I'm like, well they did give me a 'product'.
These trash and overhyped companies need to face multi-million dollar lawsuits for false advertising.
I get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games. 
It honestly feels like everywhere I look there is a scam.
This game was an AI generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
Four days. wow.
That has to be some kind of record. They didn't even TRY to hide it, that's how confident they were that they could get away with it. (And they pretty much have)
Four days... Unbelievable.
This is so blatantly a scam that I'm actually curious if this would qualify as criminal.
Like we all know that at least in America 'false advertising' will never actually be prosecuted, but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme... Also who wants to bet that those 'server issues' at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund?
As I said in other threads, they met their contractual agreement to release a game. They send their volunteers a boilerplate ""thank you"" email, pay their ""investors"" and whatever is left they'll pocket without legal ramifications. Can't get money from a stone so by closing up shop they're effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investors/creditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have. 

They used the hype of TDB to generate a trickle of income through Prop Night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates.

At this point Steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue. 

They pretty much have to at this point.
It's been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip - folks are claiming it was built using the $300 ""American City Packs (Bundle)"" which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95% of the in-game world would suggest is accurate. It's also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the $65 ""Survival Game Kit V2"", which is where the in-game inventory mechanics all come from.

This was so obvious from day 1. Too bad people still gave them money.
Watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly I can’t fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
Shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming, which is that I almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the *actual* product is instead of the dressed-up version seen in trailers and marketing.
Personally, I think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry. These kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported, and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing.
It would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release.
Imagine if you were one of those volunteers thinking they had a hand in something great, and find out later the boss was scamming
This has been my favorite game for the last two years. Not because I was excited for it, but because it’s just been a rollercoaster of bad PR and terrible decisions that led to what everyone knew from the beginning -that this was a scam!
I will forever thank this game for providing us with some of the funniest (and much deserved) rant reviews on YouTube.  What the developers did sucks but I haven't laughed this much in years.  These reviews are priceless.",20,Gaming,673000,PT12M3S

Apparently Steam also holds money for 30 days.  They're also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played.  So it looks like the developers jumped ship too early.
Luckily! Steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark. This was too much of a Scam even for Steam.
Players and valve should put these guys in court
One thing I have learned over the years is ""there are people defending it"" means absolutely nothing in the world of video games.    They love abuse.
What people have to learn:
NEVER believe trailers. 
NEVER pre-oder anything.
Wait till the game is fully released.
This is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on (Or rather orchastrated) this game. So people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
Not to mention Fntastic used ""volunteers"" in their development process. They asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received ""participation certificates"" and ""free codes"" for the game. Every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it.
The fact that the studio literally said, “shit happens” is ….wow
Level- “I gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isn’t that easy.”
*Seconds later*
Also Level- “Random guy on Reddit is recreating the game by himself.” 😂 💀
I remember watching you when I was in middle school and you made airsoft videos! I’m happy to see you’re still at it man keep up the hard work 🔥
Imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be.
Keep an eye on The Ranchers, it was announced at TGA a year ago and is going down the same route - even after a successful kickstarter.
I have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens. regardless of whether or not Fntastic is actually in the red or not, other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity. expect to see people learning from the errors made by Fntastic and performing scams better. keep an eye out everyone, do NOT buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear. be cautious and stay safe, and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
The frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam. This was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release. Yet they bought it anyway. It's pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time.
My biggest issue is I was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self. But every video and trailer I watched I kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it. But the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
I always follow the rule of: If it looks and sounds too good to be true. It probably is. Especially when they never show real in game footage.
The gaming community should keep an eye on these people. Apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to Eight Points. I feel they'll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
Been appreciating your efforts since BF3.  Thank you for what you do.
Imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody. I bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year. That’s making the game actually playable and improving on things too.
I think this is a good thing, long term, for consumers. If this doesn't get people to wise up and quit shelling out money for games without a good idea of what they're getting (something with a lot of third-party gameplay videos) then there's no hope for video gamers.",20,Gaming,1940000,PT10M53S

Mumbo, you should make a machine that retracts fence posts,
Just in case you’re being chased down by a warden 😂
I like Mumbo’s concept of a basic loop, and a “jumbled” loop. However, instead of jumbled loop, I think it should be called a Jumbo loop.
if it is soo simple, Get Grian and Scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
It is kinda funny to see how closely Mumbo’s three design rules parallel the design principles I’m learning as an engineering undergrad
I've never really gotten that into redstone, so I'm genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along! Flying machines always mystified me, but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes *so* much sense! Kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it!
I love when we get Mumbo videos like these - feels like the balance between Theory and Tutorial that makes it really easy (for me personally) to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards. It doesn't ruin the magic of how you make them; far from it, it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand HOW COOL YOUR STUFF IS.
yknow, for tight timing things like this, i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod - or recording in the 1.20 snapshots.
That way you'd have access to tick freeze and tick step, which would make these explanations even better imo!
This was actually really informative. I've built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas, but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots. Thank you, Mumbo :)
P.S. Cool Armadillo. I love the eyebrows.
you should use the new 1.20.3 /tick rate & /tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video, would probably help alot
What you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn. Programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together. When you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique. A person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning, and cool looking, final product
The fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
Reminds me of clockwork. Certainly gears are simple at their core, but when combining them in large geartrains, the complexity increases. A lot of it is down to timing (speed) and torque. 

Fascinating.
From now on, every time Mumbo states that something is simple, we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement.
I've only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle, and I've already learned so much about these flying machines. Thank you so much, Mumbo!
Great video as always! Not sure if you've had a look at all the new snapshot features yet (besides the crafting bench), but the variable tick speed is really useful for showing/seeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly.
The carpet mod (or even in vanilla since 1.20.3) adds the /tick command
This is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game, and then go one tick at a time and see exactly what's happening and when.
Incredibly informative. Grian and Scar can now fix Doc's giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 😄
I think this makes the whole process so much cooler, even if in total it's fairly simple

There is one thing all these youtubers should know:

""The only safe house in Minecraft is a hidden one!""
-Mumbo Jumbo
Oh boy… this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these… 🤔
Yeah these ‘safest bases’ are usually pathetically easy to enter. Their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create ‘easy defenses’ that are redundant and pointless, serving to introduce more vulnerability
I thought this base was really secure but then I had a very good idea, I used F5, see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and I was able to see that this base was insecure
I knew he would debunk it eventually, while watching I was like, bro kenadian is going to DESTROY This lol
Lesson learned: next time you want to build a base, watch out for kenadians in the wild.
Yer... The base is kinda dumb. It only works if you obey very specific rules, and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare.

All these safest bases just don't work without other mods, commands, datapacks etc to add additional mechanics.

Still thanks for showing just how easy it is.
When Kenadian is bored, he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things:
1. I'm glad Carvs was a good sport about this, it's always nice to see someone who can take a joke.
2. I was thinking the exact same things when I was watching his video. I was like, ""Couldn't someone just fly or build through this whole thing? This design seems super exploitable.""
Someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools: damn this is a safe base
Kenadian beating it without taking damage: *hold my beer*
2:31 3:22 I love the little detail of while he's explaining why this base is actually secure, he's just chilling in the middle of the ""danger"" zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
This safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremode.(New to minecraft)
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
I looked at this base and thought it was very secure. But then I had a very good idea - I used blocks. See, using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armor/potions. Simple.
The fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
Guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point, mad respect
Is easier to destroy than to create. No base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated. Still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base.
i was already impressed. but the half a heart challenge was the cherry on top for me. Well done

The last time Olivia Rodrigo performed a Tiny Desk concert, it was two years ago, in a deserted DMV office, back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldn't play the real Desk. But this year, the singer-songwriter returned, bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the NPR Music office. ""It's much cooler to be here,"" Rodrigo says. ""I was saying earlier, I've never been starstruck by a room before.""

Many of the songs on GUTS, which earned a special recommendation on NPR Music's Best Albums of 2023 list, blow out Rodrigo's sound into colorful, grungy pop-rock fit for a stadium, like ""love is embarrassing,"" performed here with Rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar. But the artist builds her set out with GUTS cuts that fit the intimate setup, like the searing ""vampire,"" her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines, or the potent ode to female jealousy, ""lacy,"" which Rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class. By the end of her set, she's completely alone at the piano for the sobering ""making the bed,"" and it's not difficult to see why she's one of pop's most promising rising performers.

09:22 ""lacy""
13:36 ""making the bed""
""Lacy"" and ""Making the Bed"" contain some of Olivia's most deeply introspective and creatively complexed lyrics on the GUTS album.  ""Lacy"" vividly defines the internal experience of envy and poetically describes the psychological and emotional tug-of-war raging inside of someone that both worships and despises another person who has become an obsession.  ""Making the Bed"" defines the internal struggle of accepting the inevitable side effects that come with getting everything that one wants while holding oneself responsible for the decisions that lead to negative results.  Olivia has said in interviews that she is proud of the songs on GUTS that explore other topics (outside of heartbreak), and both of these songs reveal the expanding imagery and specificity of her writing that is both real and relatable, especially when performed live.
I still have not recovered from the cathartic SNL performance and Olivia strikes again with four of my favorite songs from GUTS! Love the drama and the vocals in each of these songs.

the reason why I like this album so much is because I think it achieves what every artist hopes their follow-up album will.  she is a very mature songwriter, and you can hear her mature with her lyrics. sour was fun and represented her age very well, and I think guts does the same…but she has applied her deeper understanding of herself to her writing and has expressed some of her emotions more vulnerably, while still remaining integral to her personal style which initially popularized her. even lacy explores the concept of jealously on a much more intricate level than some of the songs on her previous album. this is a beautiful second album and such a fluid transition from sour. I’m excited to see what else she puts out in the future.
It’s just incredible how she has a beautiful voice even when she has no auto tune or edits, it’s amazing and an anomaly, truly.

Quick Edit: AHHH almost 100 LIKES?!
😮 this was far and away one of the BEST performances by Olivia EVER! Finally, she sang one of the BEST songs off GUTS, “Making the Bed” which she sang BEAUTIFULLY!! Also, “Lacy” was perfect too! Olivia is so gracious and polite; it’s so refreshing!
The energy and joy she puts into ""love is embarrassing"" really makes it stand out and come alive relative to the recorded version.  She's having fun and it shows.  All aree great of course
The personality. The talent. The kindness. We truly made the right artist famous. Thank you Olivia Rodrigo ❤
She is absolutely incredible; I love that she took a poetry class and it turned into a song! “Making the bed” blew me away!
Finally us love is embarrassing fans are getting to hear it performed. It’s so good!
Her tiny desk performances are always so good
I love Olivia's voice, interpretation, lyrics and band. All of them are just gorgeous at what they do. This was one of the best Tiny Desks I've ever seen, she totally deserves her grmmy nominations 💜💜💜
I felt like love is embarrassing was so underrated when it first came out and now she be opening her mini concerts with it im so happy 😭

Given how Poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this, I do hope she won't become this final hidden main antagonist.
The fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is low-key respectable. 👏Great job man.
I actually theorize that we won't meet Catnap as this giant monster right away, but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat. However, once he learns that Poppy apposes the Prototype, it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form. Keep in mind that Catnap can adjust the proportions of his body, he's a sizeshifter.
This game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
The character that is being tortured and strapped is Dog-Day, the leader of the Smiling Critters. Dog-Day is also the one of the screenshot, coming out of a large tube. We see him chasing the player on the trailer as well, coming out of that same tube. I believe that the guy on the phone saying ""This is what he does to heretics."", etc, is Dr. Harley ""The Doctor"" Sawyer, from Project Playtime. I am not sure, but his voice is surely the same voice actor. The Dr. was also the one responsible for the monsters, the project being called: ""The Bigger Bodies Innitiative"".
The little critters were so cute in a creepy way. Seeing them with long, human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel, for me, that made them look scarier than the plushie version. I also noticed the stitches on the arms. If they are working with the prototype, maybe it helped make them bigger/taller and safer. We know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys.
i'll be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 🤣
The scratch on the wall fully says ""FATE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE"". Also. That character we see tied up actually looks like the dog. It has the same ears and if you look closely, that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth. This character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us. Or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told. Also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists. Making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us.
I think 19:01 says ""PEACE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE."" I'm really excited for the game though! Thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us, Mike!
Chapter 3 is lookin very good so far! Also massive props to Mob Entertainment, just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story, just can’t wait to see it now! XD
Man I can't even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see CatNap, and something tells me that this is going to be the SCARIEST chapter ever
My theory on Nightmare Huggy is that it's the same one from chapter one, but under the influence of Catnap, who saw how obedient Huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again - through Catnap's orders.
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went 'wild'  or rabid.  The fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting. Cant wait to see  who's the real bad guy or something
Given how much information is in this next chapter, I wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe they'll do one more and then end the game. It seems like we're going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so I would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype. (Also I just thought of this, but it's possible the player is a toy themselves. If they were a bigger bodies toy, they would be working in the factory, have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged)
One of the biggest things I cannot wait for, is seeing how the player and Poppy interact with Kissy. But why do I have this strange feeling, like red flags are being raised, that she’ll sacrifice herself to save Poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter?

Idk, I’d be happy if Kissy lived, but I guess we will have to wait and see.
Yo, the voice lines from Poppy, it sounds so chilling. She’s actively trying to save people? And KISSY MISSY, yes!!! I knew she would be involved, that would actually be so cool. I really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people, not just “you were secretly the bad guy”
one important aspect is that the smiling cirtters or atleast catnap are made entirely of a special fluid material that gives them the ability to manifest their form. they can be as small as a mouse, or as tall as a giraffe
Knowing kissy will help us in this chapter, I can’t help but fathom that she’ll probably face off against against catnap near the end of the chapter to maybe buy us some time to escape.
Geez, Catnap is huge and awesomely and genuinely terrifying. And seeing Kissy and Poppy helping us is very interesting",20,Gaming,2110000,PT21M8S

A two hour tutorial so you cant refund the game is genius.
The way Chris utilized his speech organs to tell you he was Chris is why this should’ve been awarded game of the day before
I love how when you shoot a zombie it reacts a moment after you hit it. This realism is truly ahead of it's time.
The fact that you managed to encounter some zombies puts you ahead of a bunch of other reviewers I've seen.
That ""division, subtraction"" joke was fucking brilliant.
“Your speech organs seem fine.”

Real actual dialogue.
""Your speech organs seem fine"" being one of the first things you hear in this game is truly something else man
Calling this game ""Subtraction"" as a reference to Division is actually a stroke of genius
That part where you shot the zombie in the head and its head exploded 3 full seconds later was great. This is truly one of the games of all time
Lost it at “Can you tell me about your zombie fighting tactics?”
Nobody is talking about how he selected The Last of Us as the game. This is pure gold. As always TheLastDunkle delivers
Not ""try getting up"" or ""try standing up"" or ""try walking around""

No, they went with ""try getting off the bed"", a very realistic line that a real person would definitely say
This game makes me appreciate actual video game artists 1000x more
It cracks me up that the description for the roamer class at the beginning says, “with the onset of the apocalypse, you set a goal to change your life for the better.” Like how and why does the apocalypse inspire someone to start improving their life if they were a drunkard before? 😂
Dunkey's wisecracks in this were some of his best for sure. You can tell the power of dad jokes are beginning to course through his veins.
it's extremely funny to me that a day after posting this video, the studio behind this game announces they're closing
Walking around an empty city truly makes this a ""Strand-type game""
When Gollum was released, Daedalic ended up closing their studios over a month later. 
This game releases and Fntastic Studios closes up 4 days later, the game has also since been removed from the Steam Marketplace.

Congrats to the policewoman who has shown more common sense than all that bunch of securitydiots.
Well done Brendan. You single handedly defused a large group of security and a friendly police force. Have they nothing better to do ?
Hats off to the police woman, what a legend. I hope network rail management see this video and read the comments!
Now, here in Western Australia, we always thought that ""public pianos"" were there to encourage people to play.  Age old story - give a ""small"" man some power and it will go straight to their heads.  The bobbies did a great job.  Well done DrK.  From a retired copper. Merry Christmas.
Well done Dr K......who were these so called Security Jokers?? Bravo for common sense from the cops!! Keep playing Brendan .....everybody loves your excellent playing.
You are not only a genius Dr but a very Brave Man and you fight for your principles!👏👏👏
Brilliant 😂 these foreign security personnel need to learn the British way 🎄merry Christmas
never stop bringing joy to the world
Ahhh. Security doing their best NPC impressions as usual. Bunch of useful idiots, unable to read a situation. Well played, Brendan!
Security people need to wise up and catch themselves on. Taking issue with you Brendan is a total disgrace. You bring nothing but delight to people. How dare they.
And then those mighty  and tough but miserable security guards  slopped away and dissapeared silently ,  hahahaha   
       THANK YOU  ELLA !!!!!!
People of the world, we have indeed lost it. I mean wtf? Face this way, that way. You play, no play? Coppers and security for a man and a piano. Hilarious 😂😂😂
Musicians often have a hard life. Instead of getting paid for such high quality performance, he has to be glad not being banned or arrested. Simply ridiculous. Greets and admiration from Germany.

That music is good for your soul, what kind of absolute monster would want to put a stop to it?? Shame on these freaks who would dare to stop such a performance. Who are these people to dictate anything?? Brendan you are my new hero, trying to bring some happiness to the world. Love and respect, and Merry Christmas.
You go Branden ! Rock Rock.. what a miserable security !! Keep playing!!
😮 How dare you inject JOY into these people's lives 😊...Beautiful Lady Officer and Well done You ❤

#GivesYouWings​​​ #F1​​​",959,"Vettel next please, don't make us beg for it. It just simply has to happen.
Happy for DC, he put a lot of effort into building up this team, glad he got to drive their best car to this date
For all the work DC has done for RB to lay the foundation for what it is today, he absolutely deserves to experience such masterpiece of machinery. Now I wanna see Newey, Webber, and Vettel in the RB19 as well
DC is one of the smartest, funniest and most knowledgeable lads around, and it's an absolute joy to watch every time he does coverage for F1. It's so amazing to see him tear up the track like an absolute pro!
Red Bull is kind of company which takes a good care of its drivers, Sebastian Buemi and DC are still under RB's payroll, Mark Webber had RB money in his pocket years after he retired from F1, the company still supports Marc Marquez in MotoGP despite he's been riding for rival teams since RB-KTM partnership and Alex Albon during 2022 season in Williams had it as personal sponsor, he separated from RB just because the nature of Mercedes-Williams cooperation.
Kudos to Red Bull, I wish we had more sponsors like it.
Lovely seeing that Scottish flag on the RB19's monocoque. DC is the reason why I ever watched F1 in the first place & why I follow this team 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏆
Thank you, Red Bull and Christian, for letting DC take a lap in a truly beautiful, powerful, dominant, and awe-inspiring machine!
It's a shame he only got one lap. I would have liked to see him get fully comfortable over the course of a day.
52 years old in an current gen era car is fantastic, you can see the old school early 2000s trackline approach 
Quite a reward from Horner to a person who was dare to left McLaren Mercedes and switched to a ""new"" team run by drink company and develop the car from not competitive into very dominating..
 
Also how people remember DC nowadays : ""Schumacher angry pitlane meme""
I have a huge amount of respect for DC he helped this team go forward, and i think the team know this
DC is hands down the most likeable person in F1. You just cannot hate this man, an absolute legend!
The whitty humor of DC, LOVE IT 😂😂😂 And the comeradery within the team is so wonderful to see. How Liam fits right in. GP there. This was filmed on DR’s tyre testing day at Silverstone I think, few days after Silverstone GP. That’s why Horner was there too. I just love the humor and the fun RBR has while working hard with full focus.
The guy that helped get Newey to RB, gets to drive some of Newey 's best work. Beautiful to see
David is such a great guy! He deserved this opportunity
""The cars are very easy to drive""
- Liam Lawson the man who replaced Ricciardo after he crashed, who replaced a De Vries that couldn't stop crashing.
Thanks DC and Red Bull for an ear to ear smile throughout.
Liam comes across as a thoroughly decent guy.
Not my team but they seem to promote a family feel.
Very enjoyable.
I've had the pleasure to work with DC on several occassions for these kinds of Red Bull productions. And he really is just as likeable, genuin, humble and professional in person as he comes across in the content. 
He gives everyone the same amount of respect and time. Such a gentleman!
DC was my favorite driver when I was a kid. I just loved something about him. And now, he is my favorite F1 promoter. He still looks to be in great shape, talks passionately and throws jokes all the time. Such a joy to watch him. So nice of RB to let him drive the current car for a change. He definitely deserved it.
Rest well RB19. Privileged to have seen you perform.
Hell of a car, Max is one hell of a driver, and cheers to the team for putting together the most historic Formula 1 season of all time.",17,Sports,1610000,PT6M59S

My mother is a dermatologist and told me about tattoos and how the body protects itself from the ink, super cool to see it animated and explained!
I like how kurzgesagt always scares us about everything and then calms us down
I love how your immune system can be in a literal war while you're doing almost about just anything (and it does a good job at defending you)
This needs a follow up video about scars - what they do to your skin, what cells are involved and why they can stay around for years or your entire life.
As a doctor watching this and knowing all the process already, im still amazed by the animation and the details in it from the skin layers, to the morphology of cells and the whole process omg its… unbelievable
I always wondered how the ink managed to stay in place if the skin was constantly getting replaced, and while this makes a lot of sense at the same time it's stranger than anything I would've imagined. The immune system is a beautiful thing.

I've always been on the fence when it comes to getting a tattoo. Most of the people I know have tattoos with great sentimental value attached to them, be it about remembering loved ones or representing a difficult time in their life that they overcame, etc. Meanwhile, I could only ever come up with tattoo ideas referencing video games I liked.

After learning how much trauma I would have to put my poor immune system buddies through in order to get a tattoo, I'm especially glad I've held off on getting one.
2 episodes in a week?! Let’s hope that the animation and writing team aren’t in crunch mode to produce these at a quicker pace
Having a background in histology makes me appreciate how cleanly you guys portray stuf like fibroblasts and stratified epithelium
I learned that tattoo ink is picked up by lymphatic vessels and transported to the next lymph nodes where it gets stuck and that the colour can eventually be seen if you actually look at those lymph nodes. It was also said that there hasn't been any known case of exceeding the lymph node's capacity by having lots of tattoos.
I wonder why the body would rather keep the ink in place than try to transport it away and at least try to filter it out via the lymphatic system.
As someone who is heavily tattooed, this is fascinating. I had a basic understanding of what was going on, but this really helps visualize and clarify. Also, once, after a very long session trying to finish a full sleeve, my lymph node in my armpit swelled up and was very sensitive. My doc (who is also tattooed) said it is common and that is was my system getting a bit overwhelmed with the amount of excess ink it was trying to move through the system. With some heat, light massage, and hydration, my immune system recovered in about a day, and is back to kicking ass.
As a dermatologist watching this, I can say that you guys really did great deep research about this ❤ well done, the presentation is pretty good
A accidentally gave myself a tattoo on the knuckle when I was 17. I accidentally tagged myself with the disc of an angle grinder (my dad would remove the safety guards). Long after the the deep abrasion healed it had a blue/black colour, not sure what the ""ink"" was. I guess bits of grinder disc, metal or paint? After more than 20 years It still hasn't fully faded, but now I know why it's still there! Awesome video as always Kurzgesart!
Ah now i get why my husbands tattoo artist (who is known in the area for being extremely cautios about sanitary and health safety) refused to tattoo me and recommended not doing it at all. 
The fact aside that i'm allergic to PPD, which is not in the tattoo paint he uses, after seeing my other allergies (turpentine aka fragrances, metals, benzocaine, etc, all being contact allergies) he told me that i must be sick rarely, but when i am, i'm over the top out of it. And yeah that's true - plus my body temperature is naturally nearly 1 C° below average, so what other consider a slight fever makes me feel like i'm cooking inside.
Well, he told me that my immune system is overdoing it, literally taking out machine guns to fight off flies. So giving me a tatoo, even avoiding my allergy triggers, would throw my immune system into world war mode and could cause serious - if not permanent - damage. I didn't really get how a tattoo could do that, i guess now i do. Dang, and i really wanted a full back tattoo all my life.
Thank you, immune system, for defending me even when I'm in the wrong
On one hand, I think I can safely say I definitely not getting a tattoo.

On the other hand, I now appreciate my body a lot more. Hooray for immune systems!
Sometimes parts of some of my older tattoos will randomly raise and get itchy, and I’ve always thought it might be because my immune system was fighting off something. It seems that may have been correct after all!!
WOW!!! That is all I have to say. You guys upload high-quality videos more frequently these days( maybe because you guys have more funding and more time to put into videos because it used to take weeks for Kurzgesagt to upload a new video), and I really appreciate the efforts your team put into these projects.",27,Education,21500000,PT9M9S

Ankaragucu’s president, Faruk Koca, struck the referee, Halil Umut Meler, at the end of their home match after Rizespor scored a 97th-minute equaliser. Koca walked on to the pitch and hit the referee when the final whistle blew in the 1-1 draw at Eryaman Stadium. The president of Turkey's football association, Mehmet Buyukeksi, condemned the event as an ""inhumane attack"" and announced an indefinite suspension to matches in all Turkish leagues. Koca and two others have been arrested for ""injuring a public official"".

There needs to be some extremely harsh consequences for this or we will just see it replicated some time in the future. This is a great example of what losing control of your emotions can result in
Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Prison is the only place for these people.
The guy that kicks him in the face while lying on the floor is even worse than the guy who threw the first punch.
Real men doesn't do such ill-mannered offensive things! Real men behave themselves!
Absolutely disgusting behavior & very immature. Hope all involved in the assult on the Ref get arrested
He was kicked by another guy on the right as well , hope they dont miss it
The kick was worse then the punch
I hope that ref is okay.
I've seen the behaviour of grassroots football in the UK and that can be quite bad. 
I've haven't seen anyone assaulted but its come close a few times and the abuse hurled at refs by fans, players, coaches can be awful.
just to say that a year ago this guy took a fair play award
So cheap shots him and then someone kicks him while he is unprotected. Class! Keep watching soccer gents, we dont want you in rugby games.
If this happens to all leagues anthony taylor would have been dead years ago 😅😂😂
If it happened in England, English clubs would be thrown out of every competition going. It won't be dealt with the same way here though.
And people wonder why we have a referee shortage....
Kicking a man while he is down is simply pathetic
I'm not condoning this behaviour as its wrong on every level but I believe there's a simple reason why it happens, or why there's a strong potential for it to happen, at any top level game.  The reason is that there's FAR TOO MUCH MONEY involved in the modern game, growing it into a monstrous entity worldwide.  This places pressure to perform upon managers and players, pressure from sponsors, etc., to win games and trophies.  It has grown too big, too fast and needs calming measures applied
before something worse than this punch happens.
Turkiye boyle bilinsinnustemezdik
Even his captain was shocked 😮
The neck brace 😂😂
That hospital scene like something out of a comedy sketch. That punch wouldn't have knocked over a 5 year old.
Very often, such thuggish behaviour can be attributed to the culture. Of course, this should not be deemed as an excuse. You should have seen the crowd trouble in Indonesian football stadia. The players too get consumed by the events , the spectators would be wondering if they are watching a kung fu spectacle. 😮

Honestly Bethesda owes modders millions for fixing their games all these years.
quick update- had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the House Building song from RDR2. All I basically say is that “the bounty system in starfield is even worse than RDR2 and being a pirate is so discouraged it’s borderline impossible” anyways thanks so much for watching this video 🥹 I was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it! ❤❤ big ups to the whole island 
-jacob
An amazing and high quality video as always Jakey! I seriously appreciate you mentioning how good Skyrim's OST is since that's like the king of music for me. FYI the audio cuts out at 29:48 - 30:05 and 30:15 - 30:23
Really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing, the flow, the script, the scene choices, the cutaway timing, all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same. New, but nostalgic. This is a huge development in the NakeyJakey career path, maybe getting a bit wiser...  can't wait to see a new video in like 3 years!
16:55 as a parent of a toddler seeing this Ms. Rachel spoof sent me. It was really well done. And to be clear, we absolutely adore Ms. Rachel in my house.
For a year before Starfield’s launch, my manager couldn’t stop talking about it. He would go on and on about how it was everything he’s ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched.

Last week, he came poked his head out from the other room and asked, “What was the name of that space game we used to play?” Dude couldn’t even remember the name of it anymore. Now granted, my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid (his favorite movie of all time is Battlefield Earth…. I know), but I still feel like this means something.
That clip of Todd Howard saying how he told everyone he’d make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
Dear Jacob,

Another fantastic video as always. I really liked the style of cinematography in this one. It was obviously different than your usual style, but that's not a bad thing by any means. It felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend. 

I've been following your content since 2017 - went all the way through high school and am starting college now, always looking forward to the next Jarby video. Thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us, and enjoy the holidays!
An entire town wanting you dead in Skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly, but the idea that Starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what you've done is the funniest thing I've heard all week.
I think the signs were there a long time ago...I played ES4 Oblivion extensively...wasn't perfect but I still had a lot of fun with it...when Skyrim came out I was hyped, but I never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after I got it, it was exceptionally underwhelming. I still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line (EG, I always preferred Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storyline over fighting dragons,) then something has gone terribly wrong.
Something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every ""unexplored frontier"" planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it. I'm not exploring and finding something new, I'm just playing tourist. It would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot #35
Thank you for finally putting into words why I just could not get into Starfield! I am a huge Bethesda fan - I have been playing Skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes, along with the Fallout games. I wanted to love Starfield so much, but after a few hours I just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there. I also think you're one of the few people who shares my opinion on Fallout 3's atmosphere vs. New Vegas, so I appreciate the nod to that as well.
Starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isn't fun and there's like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn.
33:33 Funny thing about the item vacuum in jail. The items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room, and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower. Early game it’s actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared, lock pick your stuff back, then be on your way.
I hope you have as much fun making these videos as I do watching them. Whether it's 6 videos a year or just 1, I am here for it. Thanks! ❤",23,Comedy,1960000,PT37M22S

This is Seths best promo to date
We are witnessing the start of a feud that is destined to go down as one of the greatest feuds in WWE history
Didn't expect to see them face to face already. Punk didnt have to say much, just save it for later
Punk V Rollins Night 1, and Cody vs RR night 2. THAT would be one the best Mania's in like 10 years
One whole minute with no words, no fighting. Just two men, with a lot of shared history staring each other in the eyes. Poetry.
Awesome back and forth, Seth gave me flashbacks to the infamous Punk & Hangman promo at one point, Seth and Punk built a level of tension and intrigue rarely done, two of the very best there are.

Can’t wait to see this feud play out
Finally after more than a decade wwe is making me want to tune in every week again. Triple h has absolutely killed it since taking over. Punk and Rollins feud is going to be 🔥🔥
THAT is a promo, no random swear words, no random mockery, no randomly praising the fans, straight to the point.
Dam that stare down was legendary 🔥🔥
This Segment Was Everything I Wanted Seth Roasting Punk And Punk Just Takes It And It More Focused Winning The Battle By Taking Seth's Title  Such Good Writing
what a time to be alive as WWE fans 🔥
I'm still trying to process this, CM Punk back in WWE, never thought I'd see it. But then again, never thought Bret Hart and HBK would make peace.
Rollins just delivered one of his greatest promos. And with CM Punk just standing there, he also told one of the greatest stories he's ever told, without saying a word except for just a few. Bravo. We are watching history, folks!
There is no better promo, love him or hate him... CM Punk makes tv time Money
It's so hard to believe he left the company 10 years ago and he's officially back in the WWE. He has went through hell with his sports career so I salute him.
Punk back in WWE is actually pretty cool
This wasn’t Seth Rollins talking to CM Punk, this was Colby Lopez talking to Phil Brooks
This segment RULED. Both men killed it 🔥
This was the promo I’ve been waiting for, but even then, I didn’t expect ol’ Seth to go in on him that hard!!😮 Seth must really have some serious anger towards Punk and they must have told him to let it all out on the 🎤 😅😂",17,Sports,5130000,PT15M5S

Now he knows what it’s like to play the Chiefs 😂😂😂
The call was 100% correct. Chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
For those who didn't watch SNF tonight...

This penalty was called once in 2021, twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season. 

So it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials. And the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasn't some conspiracy. 

Mahomes' reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled.
There has been a lot of bad officiating this season. 

This was an example of good officiating.
Hes looking at the baaaaaaaall , and still line up off side....WoW!
Chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldn´t happen at such an important point of the game.  We should go back and see what the Eagles think about the holding call in the Super Bowl last year... Chiefs weren´t complaining then...
Never understood why ANY player, whatever the position, would line up offside.  These guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do.  You don't even have to move your bod, just use a couple of neck muscles, turn your head and LOOK.  Unbelievable.
Because the Chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years, Mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him. The bills won this game and they don’t even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called. Mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs, he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral 🙌
Still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
If you're lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder (around the defensive lineman standing next to you) to see the ball.  You're offsides.  How did Toney not realize the ball and center was behind him?
Doesn't matter how many times it was called before. You know the rules, offsides is offsides, end of story. He could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches, he knew the game was at stake, and if he didn't know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known.
He was looking right at the ball. How could he not know to move back? That's on him.
What's shocking is that Toney didn't drop the lateral from Kelce.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral
Ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
As a Broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
It does look like offsides but what a cool play. The Chiefs are an amazing team.
Geez that was a great throw, a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting TD…. Would have been fun in highlight reels, Kelce probably can’t reenact that last-second pass, what a shame!!",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S

Jacob is a PHENOMENAL actor
Lou, Vic, and Jake, on one episode of game changer. That's 100% going to be a banger
I love getting all worked up for a new Dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
The way my heart caught in my throat when Jacob started yelling at Sam.
Love that BDG is doing a lot of stuff with Dropout nowadays.
I can’t tell you how excited I am to see Nathan on Dropout again. Please please please more collabs with the Drawfee hosts. Their gremlin energy is just what I need ❤
Seeing Nathan actually makes me a little emotional. Drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropout/CH, but I'm glad to see some Drawfee/dropout mixing is still possible.
I saw Jacob storm out and then the TV says “do something great for the trailer” I mean…. I had to pause the trailer because I started dying of laughter
Well Jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 😂
The fact that I was not scared at all Jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of Dropout
More Vic, more Brennan meltdowns, and more Grant skin? YES, PLEASE. Also, I love how ""upset a producer"" was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set, but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks 😂Give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos! 😁
BDG, Sungwon, AND NATHAN?! The already incredible cast is only getter better 🥺
I'm so excited
I'm stoked as always. And I just wanted to say that the ""that should cut good"" shows such respect for your audience, and we hardly ever see that in reality TV. Nicely done, y'all.
BDG and Sungwon graduating from Make Some Noise to Game Changer proper plus Caldwell and Nathan making their Game Changer debuts?!?! Oh yeah. This is gonna be a good season.
Love how the marketing/throughline of this series keeps getting slightly more ""horror/thriller"" with each season.
Jesus, Jacob’s acting legitimately got me there for a second
I'm so relieved Jacob wasn't actually upset! I teared up a bit lol
I’m so excited for Nathan Drawfee!! Hopefully this will lead to more Drawfee/Dropout crossovers in the future, I need some more snilk and Drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
I’m so excited to see Nathan. As a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan I’m happy to see you folks doing stuff together. Even after Drawfee went independent I hoped there’d be some crossovers still. And I’m not disappointed. (I see why you didn’t have Karina, she’s too powerful. Although she’d rock in a yu-gi-oh episode of um actually.) 

Also wow, Jake’s acting! Phenomenal.
spotted my boys Caldwell and Nathan and I am absolutely stoked, also always very glad to see bdg more on dropout!",23,Comedy,14700000,PT1M51S

Girona is doing a legendary tale in La Liga, taking down on of the giants of the league and could even make it to the UCL next season or even win the league
A painful blow to Barcelona fans, Girona. They deserve a loss, a well-deserved win, and a lead ❤
Rafinha is the quintessential manifestation of everything wrong with wingers, tactics that involve wingplay and the death of Brazilian futbal. Brutal
Of all the games this season, this game is the most understandable loss. Girona did very well. We need to get it together and move on.
Girona played exceptionally well and were even reminiscent of how we used to play back in the day. A truly embarrassing display though, there’s no passion or anger when we concede anymore, our players just hang their heads and go on about it. If I were the coach I would be furious at this shocking mentality of my players. They have to remember that they play for FC Barcelona and that means to give it their absolute all, every single match. There’s no ferocity, no intensity or that sheer hunger to destroy our opponents and win games anymore. Other clubs used to fear us and for good reason. 

I’m so disappointed as a Barça fan now of 14 years and to see these issues not being addressed and fixed, especially at this level of football, it’s completely unacceptable and ridiculous. I need a drink and I don’t drink, goodnight.
El partido que más me ha dolido esta temporada la verdad, falta mentalidad ganadora, donde estaba el Barça competitivo del partido pasado contra el Atleti? Donde estuvo el compromiso, la unión , el ritmo , el buen juego del partido pasado, un Barça tan dinámico?  Sin estas cosas no vamos a llegar a ningún lado, y no se que hará Xavi, pero la mentalidad del equipo tiene que cambiar a bien, pero bueno, a seguir a delante que tenemos que remontar en LaLiga, no podemos dejar que se nos escape, porque la calidad la tenemos...
Love how we see Barca's goal multiple times in all angles and Girona's goals are just shown once
It's crazy that this back 3 was consistently being rock solid through out the last season but apparently forget how to defend this match
Girona's game has changed drastically this season it feels like a dream.
I can't believe Girona playing a wonderful match ❤❤❤
Congrats for our Catalan friends Girona, they totally outplayed us and showed that definitely deserve the title! Some of our players seriously have to think about their form this season! We are awful, for 16 matches we have conceded 18 goals so far, by comparison for the whole previous season we conceded 20 goals! We'll be stronger, better times will come for us, Visca Barca! 💙❤️
As a Barca fan am really happy for Girona but for the entire Barca team the least said about them the better.
Go Girona . Super campeonato que está fazendo com pouco orçamento comparado com os 03 Grandes da La liga.
Yes, i know that Girona have been great all season long putting up big performances throughout the year, but this is truly UNACCEPTABLE... WE ARE FC BARCELONA FFS !!
Well done Girona, y'all got yourself a wonderful team this year !
Estão fortissimos... Problema não aguentarão, manter esse ritmo até ao fim...
Felicidades al Girona
Vamos Barza!!! Aún queda mucha liga",17,Sports,16200000,PT3M14S

Me encanto la musica esta muy buena 😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
Estas canciones de ese año, me da tristeza y felicidad porque me recuerda a mi papá, que siempre las ponía en su tocadiscos o en la radio. Me recuerda mucho a él. Entiendo porque las escuchaba. Su infancia no fue fácil, era dura, mi abuelo no lo trataba muy bien, fue duro con él ,El desde niño trabajaba, hay que recordar que en los tiempos de antes era difícil. Una de esas contó que trabajaba en el mercado tenía 12 años y él ayudaba a una señora con su mandado para subirlo a su carro de ella. Y una de esas no sé qué pasó que se regresó por una bolsas para la señora para el mandado y ella se había ido…… Le compro ese mandado a él 😢 también nos contó que trabajaba limpiaba carros, y que mi abuelo lo mandaba a pedir dinero porque aveces no había, y tenía que caminar mucho…….. asta que tuvo 22 años y se topó aún amigo que le ofreció trabajo en la CESMP del gobierno y cambio subjdia para bien. en fin muchas cosas nos contó en los años de los 50s mi papá ahora tiene 68 años y es muy fuerte. ❤ en los 70s se casó con mi mamá. tiene su casa propia, a nosotros…. Muy bien gracias a dios.

#RedFalcon #Gaming #Mario",474,"Wubba's fate is still tragic, but congrats to the winner!! What a well-deserved victory
That was a masterpiece, a total roller-coaster of emotions. Even the man with no tear ducts that can't cry shed tears for our fallen warriors. We love you Hoppy. And R.I.P Metal Mario the original under dog
this one is special to us. i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible ❤
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
Genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops. That was a wild vid
Even though hoppy cat won, congrats to medal Mario for being the underdog
This video is the true definition of tragic. I rooted for metal mario the whole way through, but he came just short. But congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory.
Why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream, can’t wait for the faster Mario kart to become a vid :)
But… how far can the hoppycat go?
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did, he DESERVED first, he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory, meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection. Even if metal mario only got second, he had to work for it. im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it weren't for that level, and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
Mods are already so crazy.... I'm so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds!!
The fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasn’t possible is impressive itself
This is crazy! I haven’t seen the end yet, but this is gonna be interesting, every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay, so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting.
As a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win!
You should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go, and I already know he’ll be going to world 4 at least, since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels. I was rooting for them and am so happy they won.
I'd love to see Hoppycat beat the game! Always love the little enemies.
Great video, so many twists and turns! As a long time red falcon fan I must say I'm loving these new videos and editing style!
wonder how far the wubba would've made it if water levels weren't required, i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game
Fantastic video! Love the concept, execution, and editing!

#VGG #cadillac",9285,"I worked for Cadillac as a district service manager when that car was introduced. In pre-release service meetings, it was well-known from the very beginning, that the 8/6/4 was planned to be a one-year-only engine. The big problem was the early Delco electronics. The MAP sensor was calibrated with too-close tolerances. If the engine hic-upped (backfired) it would shut down. There was no repair except to replace the MAP sensor. The bigger problem was replacement stock was the exact same part, and it took GM a while before an updated unit could be supplied. Dealers would disconnect the 8/6/4 feature, running it as an 8cyl only. The press had a field day. I inspected a limo in West Palm Beach, Florida, that the owner wanted all the interior chrome replaced. Someone had discharged a tear gas device inside the car that caused the damage ( the interior chrome pieces came from different suppliers, so it was impossible for all of it to be defective) and I denied the claim. It turned out the limo was owned by the owner of the newspaper 'The National Inquirer"" (famous for stories like 'I got pregnant by an alien, etc.) They went on a HUGE hate campaign, smearing the vehicle, which only threw fuel on the fire. Those were tough times to be a Cadillac District Service manager.
As a 35 year mechanic I want to say that I admire Derek for messing with that aggravating thing. RESPECT!
""The brake drum has traveled farther than the vehicle itself"" man that was classic.
God I love me an old school Caddy!
The Cadillac of despair. What a test of wits and perseverance. I felt for you through all of it while still bursting into laughter a number of times. What an extraordinary episode, thanks Derek for actually putting this one out :)
Oh man, that brake drum divorcing itself from the vehicle was epic. It totally went with the whole project. My experience with TBI dumping fuel was the coolant temp sensor 2 wire funny enough. The computer relied on coolant temp for fuel mapping. Could be bad injectors maybe. Great video, laughed a lot
This revival will be a top favorite now just for the amount of genuine laughs as things kept progressively happening. The brake drum and the flame out of the  TBI.  You’re the best man thank you for what you do!
What a fight!! I think this is a great candidate for a junkyard LS. Or a good old 350.
Way to keep on fighting through! I would’ve thrown in the towel way earlier!
I don’t think GM TBI fuel injection from the 80’s worked like a modern ECU. It was a while ago, but I think they start in open loop mode with a fixed map on temperature, manifold pressure, and throttle position. Once it warms up, it switches to closed loop mode where it mostly uses the O2 sensor. I bet when it was running good it was because it was in closed loop mode. Getting it to run long enough to switch to closed loop looked difficult though.
I’d love to see round 2. There are several struggles you had that I’ve learned from.
Appreciate the perseverance! I would really like to see this thing run and drive, even if it means a carb swap or something else along those lines. I just don’t think this should be how it ends with this rig.
Man you really worked for every bit of that one.

Thanks for everything you do!!
Awesome as usual! Very interesting how the critters migrated the under hood insulation to the exhaust system!
Even though she didn't drive home, this was still a fantastic episode. The patience, perseverance and diagnostic progression you show is truly impressive. Shout out to O'Reilly for the support. Absolutely loved the brake drum's desire to get back on the road!
We LOVED this episode. My wife cracked up when the brake drum shot across the shop. You can't let this thing beat you. Toss a modern EFI system on it and make it a super nice, ""Take momma out to dinner"" rig.
I definitely want to see a carburetor swap and a general engine bay cleanup where you get rid of as many hoses and wires as possible
This has to be one of my favorite episodes.......The runaway brake drum fleeing the scene and then the fire in the hole.........absolutely hilarious.  I laughed so hard my dogs starting barking at me......🤣🤣🤣🤣
HELL of an effort!! I don't think I've seen you slither the floor that much EVER. The launch of the drum was CLASSIC. My brother-in-law and some other students at an Agriculture engineering school in MO began the design on this engine in the 70's for an AG engine, NOT a passenger car. The story goes that the college sold the idea to GM and they took it and proceeded to wreck it. 
Great effort!!!
I'm only about half way through the video so far, but man, does it make me feel good watching you go through many of the struggles I go through on my Cadillac.  It makes me feel so much more normal lol
Derek what a great episode I was really hoping you would get this thing going, but props to you for showing that everything does not always go as planned and showing that sometimes even when we do our best we still fail, but it is best to learn from this experience! So what would I like to see done with his vehicle? Well, I would like to see it moving down to the road the 368 Cadillac is a great engine and very durable and reliable As long as it doesn’t have this particular fuel delivery system. Also, it is the last of the Cadillac V8 so first thing and you’ve already done this disconnect the cylinder deactivation as most Cadillac dealers did and let it run as a V-8 Secondly remove all of the fuel injection paraphernalia from 1981 and replace it with some type of Holley fuel injection system and then make sure it’s ship shape and maybe give it away I mean I would would like to own of these if it had a reliable fuel delivery system just my two cents. Thanks again for another great video.",2,Autos & Vehicles,1760000,PT2H20M59S

man, seeing these talented individuals make such wonderful art out of the craziest things makes me wish I could do the same thing XD

david's piece was just SO beautiful for being made out of melted chocolate, like DAYUM. I honestly loved mackenzie's piece as well, it was just SO detailed and amazing looking and I feel like if she wasn't punished so much she would've definitely had enough time to make a full body to attach to the head to make it look even more epic than it already did and it seriously would've been a hard decision and a SUPER close win. I honestly really loved michelle's piece, it was just SUPER adorable and honestly deserved top 3 <3
David's painting is amazing , love his style ❤ Michelle's squid and Mackenzie's dino skeleton was really good and realistic

Horror Outro ► https://soundcloud.com/shurkofficial/haunted",3295,"Mark being so confident in his answers then immediately being told he's wrong by the game is honestly one of the funniest things
Mark being so suspicious and running from a man who’s just casually walking past him is oddly funny to me.
Mark giving a stranger the longest nickname gotta be my favourite part
mark doing an accidental jumpscare by doing the posters one at a time is hilarious to me
Imagine this from the NPC's perspective, it must be hilarious. You have another person who runs up, yells at the walls, screaming ""THIS IS DIFFERENT"" and then runs in the opposite direction
I like how 90 seconds into this game, Mark's already lost his mind, calling a totally harmless bystander ""Mr. Mustache, Receding Hairline, Phone in Left Hand, Briefcase In Right, No Socks, White Shirt, Black Pants Man.""
Markiplier perfectly, yet unintentionally summed up his content in one quote. ""I have a feeling now that I'm gonna be utterly confident, and then somethings going to go horrifically wrong."" 21:20.
Mark blindly following the rule of hugging the left wall to an annoying degree, but completely ignoring all the posters is such a weird dichotomy of rule following/breaking.
The briefcase guy: ""Oh, no. Not this guy again. Just keep walkig, John. Don't look at him, don't say a word. Just go ahead and forget about him""

Mark anytime he sees him: ""WELL, WELL. LOOK WHO IT IS!""
Mark doing the quick 180 after he sees the man smiling killed me😂😂😂
Mark: WHAT DID I DO WRONG?
The most obvious door knob in the center of the door: 👁👄👁
@12:10. So as we see, there was indeed an anomaly. That “graphical glitch” was indeed indicative of an anomaly he should have turned around for. 
The anomaly was that the posters on the wall were growing. The “graphical glitch” was the frame edge of the poster clipping through Mark’s vision.
we need the full uncut version of this. gotta see Mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for an hour.
Imagine you’re just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keeps staring at you and when you finally decide to stare back they cut you off and don’t let you continue walking 😂 12:48
Mark should do more of these kind of games, it’s funny how he gets frustrated.
i love games like this, nothing super flashy and there aren't really any in your face jump scares but the way its set up and the ambiance messes with your head and starts making you more and more paranoid, questioning EVERYTHING
This is actually such a neat concept and one of the better games I've seen Mark play
Him missing the one that literally tells him to turn back is actually really funny, idk why 😂
I like these types of let's plays because the audience can kind of play along
I usually dont enjoy these types of games but this one was so fun but this one had the looping element and the numbers to tell you if youre on the right track. That made it so much fun for me. Especially since mark kept dying at the WORST times. Getting to 8 so many times just to loop again is truly a nightmare. This must be what hell is like.",20,Gaming,36000000,PT36M39S

#richeisenshow #nfl #kansascitychiefs",4098,"Maybe the officiating has been awful this year, but this isn't an example of bad officiating.  The referee did his job correctly.
Throwing the penalty flag without knowing what happens next is the most fair thing the ref can do in that situation. And Mahomes berating a ref because his team is struggling instead of holding his teammate accountable for the lack of discipline is crazy.
The fact that he was CLEARLY offsides but yet the media wants to have the convo ""should it have been called?""  Especially Rich being an NFL Network employee , is mind boggling to me.  Because what this does is opens Pandora's box of the league being rigged and choosing who they want to win by calling or not calling penalties.
The game didn't end with a bad call, It ended with three incomplete passes.
Kadarius actually looked at where the ball was and still lined up offsides. He deserves it.
I don’t remember Patrick Mahomes complaining about all the defensive penalties called against KC opponents late in games during the playoffs past couple years 😢 DIVA
The Chiefs benefit from so many calls it’s nice to finally see  it balancing out a bit.
Mahomes had absolutely no problem with the bad “unnecessary roughness” late hit on the sideline last week
Whether the penalty impacted the play is irrelevant. A couple weeks ago the Broncos missed field goal got called back because of 12 men on the field. No shot that extra man impacted the field goal but you didnt see Allen and McDermott crying to the refs about making that call in such a ""critical moment."" It's an objective call, the chiefs need to take some accountability.
Rich, just like the other Mahomes lovers, Colin, Nick and the whole cast Good Morning Football are like, “it’s Mahomes, don’t throw penalties against them inside the 2 min warning “ 😂
Offsides is like the most objective penalty in football. You can go on about controversial pass interference calls, because that's a bit more subjective of a call. But offsides is about as clear as you can get.
All that frustration from Mahomes and Reid needs to directed at Tony, not the officials.  It was a helluva play, but the guy that scored also committed an obvious foul.
The most damning thing is that the penalty didn’t end the game. Mahomes had multiple downs left to do something, and he didn’t. That’s what ended the game.
I think Rich misunderstood the ref's answer to the pool reporter. He said if the WR asked for advice he'd give it (insinuating Toney didn't check first). If he was barely offside they may choose to just warn them after the play, but it was so egregious and there was no check, so there was no way they could look the other way.
Didn't the Chiefs win a couple of games earlier this year due to last minute officiating calls that were phantom calls? I'm pretty sure one was with the Jets.
To make sure that there aren't any misunderstandings, the officials should stop letting the receivers know if they are lined up offsides or not.
Last week Chiefs got a bad call on PI.  They also benefitted from a bogus calls,  roughing on QB, no 10 second runoff on the reversal and another clock stoppage when receiver was going backwards and did NOT go out of bounds!
Rich brings back all the good ESPN memories.    Way to stay the same as you used to be.
We had a kid, a friend of mine, in High School during a scrimmage game, forget to put his mouth piece in before the snap.  The ball is snapped, a great play gaining many yards takes place, all to be called back because my friend inadvertently didn't put in his mouth piece.  Have you ever seen a play in the pro game called back because of ""an equipment malfunction""?  Game winning touchdown called back because Tom Brady threw a touchdown pass with his shirt tail hanging out.  I haven't.  But until the Chiefs game I had never seen an Offside on the offense.  Then I saw it again Sunday night when the Cowboys did it against the Eagles.  It was mentioned that like a few hours before that this penalty has all the commonality of two men wearing the same jersey number at the same time on the field, as was the case in a Boise State game a couple years ago.  But it's a written rule.  Jay Walking is a written traffic offense that not many, if any policeman has ever enforced.  But it's a written rule.  It's in the script.  It isn't the referees job to police the formations.  One article I read asked the question, ""was a warning in order"".  A warning?  Hey Kadarius, you're offside, get you butt back over on your side!  Ok.  Hey Bob, hey Pete, you two are moving at the same time, you can't do that.  Hey Bill, quit wiggling, I'll have to call you for a false start.  It's the players job to police themselves on the field, and their coaches jobs to make sure they are lined up where they should be.  Not the ref, side judge, back judge, or judge judy.  When you look at the still photo, Kadarius is practically shaking hands with the defensive player in front of him.  The flag was thrown the moment the ball was snapped, not after the touchdown ceremony had been completed.  Patrick and Andy had every right to be upset.  The same way a person caught red handed breaking into a house has the right to complain while he's being cuffed.
Thanks for bringing up the Super Bowl.  No one else has brought that up.  Mahomes gets a taste of what it's like to be on the other end.",17,Sports,666000,PT15M59S

#DAZN #DAZNBoxing #Boxing #HaneyPrograis",2268,"Haney completely outclassed and schooled Regis. Card was worth it
It really was iconic you could feel it watching it. Devin earned my respect
Now everyone can see why he needed extra 5lbs! Dude looked like a zombie before, drained af!
Looks so much healthier & energetic now!
Really impressed with what Haney has done so far. He looks unbeatable at 140. I really want to see him in there with teo and tank Davis to see who’s the best
Devin fought his best fight that I've ever seen. He's so accurate and quick with his shots. He punished Regis easily
Devin Haney is everything we wished Adrian Broner would be, dude is on a path of greatness 😊
This is like the FIRST perfect fight I've seen and Devin is waaay nicer with his hands that I thought.  He fought a PERFECT fight. He's a problem. I can't wait to see another of his fights, if he fights like this💪💯
A masterclass. Even without a stoppage Haney fought a perfect fight. He was already that guy but the stock just went up even higher.
Remarkable performance by Haney... Simply ELITE That night. Props to Prograis for Not quitting and not making any excuses after his loss. Haney was just on another level...
Absolutely amazing experience for my first time ever going to be a boxing event! The Bay showed out and so did Haney!🔥👊🏽
I'll definitely admit that I always thought Devin Haney was boring but I know that he is a great boxer with superb technical ability and skills. He definitely showed his worth last night, and I didn't go in expecting a knockout, but he completely outclassed the other man. I didn't figure his power with translate well at a higher weight class but it seems like his shots had more oomf!
It was one of the best performance I have seen in boxing this year.  Thank you, Haney, for producing a helluva performance 👏.
Haney’s accuracy is amazing. He’s so precise idk why anyone calls him boring.
Helluva performance, happy I got to experience it live. We are definitely entering the Devin Haney era!
Haney has improved a lot, he seems more technical than normal, taking care of every blow and every step, that is the essence of boxing.
Barely any holding, stayed in front, displayed his power with a knock down and making Regis stumble twice, complete shut out without taking much damage. Masterclass performance.
Devin Haney is everything we wished Adrian Broner would be, dude is on a path of greatness
I expected Haney to win a competitive fight, with a few scares along the way but he completely dominated Regis. Such a masterclass performance. So much technical brillance in this fight by Haney.
He def went in there and put on a iconic outing against a champ..much respect 💯
It was one of the best performance I have seen in boxing this year.  Thank you, Haney, for producing a helluva performance .",17,Sports,3730000,PT9M4S

I’d always remember his face of joy when he hit you during your no swearing challenge like 4 years ago XDD
It's awesome to think that when he started making vids he was considered a deadbeat kid with no future, and know to think that he is by far the most successful person in his families history and is acknowledged and loved by 21 million people. KEEP GOING LAZAR
Hey lazar, thanks for bring me and my dad so much joy and fun while watching your videos. I used to sneak watch your videos in 2018 because I wasn’t allowed to watch stuff with cursing lol, and in 2020 when Covid started I got my dad into playing Fortnite. And he found you and I had to act like I’ve never seen you before and I rewash all of your videos with me and my dad just laughing side-by-side so thank you for all the happiness and laughter youve given me and my dad! Im definitely buying a cookd shirt for me and my dad for Christmas!!

We are so proud of you from the start to now we all saw you grow and meme around. We all admire you Thank you for the hard work you put in!
It actually brings a tear to my eye see how much you have progressed in life and in your channel I have watched every video from day one and will continue to forever. Thank you Lannan for being the best inspiration I could look up to.

Upset over a blatant penalty. Man if Mahomes reacted like this over that. Imagine how he would have reacted if the Chiefs got the same treatment the Bills got in the Bills Eagles game. Refs totally screwed them.
After looking at the replay, our guy clearly lined up off-sides. The refs had to call it. Same type of dumb-ass move that we did in the AFC championship several years ago when one of you defensive players lined up off side when we intercepted Brady to nullify the play and lose the game. Mahomes needs to aim his anger in the right direction - his own man. We deserved to lose and will cont. to do so with this lousy offense. Too bad - wasting a very good defense this year.
Just a straight up fair amd square loss for the chiefs unfortunately they had an offsides that seemingly cost them the win or atleast lead, really unprofessional and pathetic that your starting quarterback has a temper tantrum on the sidelines yelling at the refs for doing their jobs well
The Chiefs had their chances to win and they didn't get it done.
classic. Man gets so many calls his way over the years, gets a few called against him and he has an aneurism.
All I have to say is that Chiefs fans got a little taste of what its like to be a Bills fan for the last 30 years.
Legend has it that Mahomes is still screaming on the sideline.
Via Adam Schefter on Twitter,

Chiefs’ HC Andy Reid was not pleased that officials did not warn him that Kadarius Toney was lined up offsides the way they have in the past. About the call, the normally mild-mannered Reid said, “It's a bit embarrassing for the National Football League for that to take place.”
I get great joy from seeing the refs treat the chiefs like every other team in the league
This was amazing to see! About time the refs make the correct call and stop making these calls for mahomes.
To be honest, there was still over a minute and the Bills had timeouts to score a TD. No guarantee that offsides call not being called would have meant a Chiefs win.
Ironic. Patrick mahomes and chiefs fans realizing what every other team has to go through when facing the chiefs.
I want to watch a football game not a every time Kelsie catches the ball we have to cut to Taylor Swift’s reaction.
There is absolutely a major problem with officials tainting games with either questionable calls or non calls  and completely subjective  penalties which on some occasions determines the outcome of the game. 

This wasnt one of them, even Stevie Wonder can see Toney was way offsides here.
No amount of cursing and yelling can deflect from the fact that they lost. Mahomes just made himself look like a spoiled unsportsman like loser.
As a Chiefs fan, I'm embarrassed and mortified by the behavoir Mahomes displayed. It shows how badly winning has gone to his head and how inflated his ego is that he can't handle losing with some ounch of dignity, even if he thought someone else was in the wrong.
Watched them take 3 games from us in the past cuz of calls like these. I still remember a game were Mahomes got intercepted 4 times and they all came back. Theyve been spoiled for too long now they think they should let little mistakes like these slide.
I love how Patrick Mahomes can throw a tantrum in front of the world but when I do it at work I need to grow up 😂
Chiefs right now are in a classic post Superbowl era. After winning, we’re gonna go through some tough struggles (mainly with our receivers) but hopefully we still stay strong and are alright going forward",17,Sports,137000,PT2M11S

I watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
Love how Olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance!  That applause was richly deserved.
guts was such a masterpiece! I can’t wait for next album! She literally never misses!
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances! 💜
This video demonstrates her creative ability so well. And how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass. ❤
Being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire, Olivia never ceases to amaze me 👏
Her breaking the glass part before the chorus is *FABULOUS* 💜💜💜
Also the scream part is WOW 😭😭😭 her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
This is exactly what I would imagine an official mv for this song would be like, and the fact that she performed it live... just perfecf ❤
ok this performance was a MOMENT. also love how she didn’t break character once the song was over and was getting applause. she stood in that ATTITUDE — tongue out, cake on the face, those *eyes* glaring at you, the intensity… so perfect!
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 💗
I love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager. Teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile we're happy and cheerful on the outside. And I love the scream so much 😂😂 Thanks Olivia 💜💜
This performance is insane, Olivia is such a hard worker. Her voice, her emotions, the way she looks is PERFECT. I’m so grateful I am a teenage girl because of Olivia
She's not just another pop queen.  Besides pop, her music has some angst and an edge to it, which is awesome.  This performance was fantastic.
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances!
Olivia entregando talento como sempre
Being a fan since Sour...this album blown away my expectations, and the performance are just brilliant. I´m a metal and rock listener and Olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music. Hope to see a show of her someday. Great work!!
MEU DEUS QUE PERFORMANCE, ela quebrando a taça na virada da música ficou incrível
i’m so proud of her and her improvement in performance. watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too. 

i’m glad i’m going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music. she saved me when the sour album dropped, it meant a lot to me, at that time i’m in my lowest point. sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better. her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty. 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand, i was 16 in my room all day and night. because of tracks on sour, i can accept my jealousy towards other girls, i can relieve my anger towards my ex-boyfriend. some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations, like his new girlfriend’s name sounds so much like mine, just slightly different.

i’m 18 now, i was so much happier than that time, i moved on. i forgive and forget. i have a lot of new friends and good memories. i got into a university and my studying great. just like she said she’s so much happier than the time when she wrote sour. i’m so happy for her and myself. 

hope she can do tour in my country!
please come to Asia. thank u!

Props to the Pacers for being in striking distance late despite a terrible shooting night. They played hard.
Lakers winning with only 2 made 3 pointers🤯 they really went back to 80s bully ball for this one! Congrats LA💜💛
The Lakers successfully didn't let Haliburton get going. Kudos to their defensive gameplan.
I was one of the ones hating on the tournament at first but it was honestly very enjoyable, I could care less if people think it matters or not, the players put in a lot of effort in and at the end of the day I just like watching good basketball
Congrats to the Lakers for their success and Thank you to the NBA for giving us some exciting competitive games early in the season.
What an incredible all round performance by the Lakers. Reddish, Vando, and Prince set the tone by their great perimeter defense and taking Harliburton out of his game. AD was an absolute beast ...41 points and 20 reb. LeBron driving like a free train to the paint. Congratulations to the Lakers 🎉❤️❤💯💯
So excited for the momentum that the Lakers will have coming off this W... the Lakers just need to figure out how to keep AD motivated, because he clearly has this in him on any given night... the inconsistency is the problem
This is high energy, fast paced basketball! The players are into it, getting hyped. Very exciting to watch. Great first in season tournament, glad it’s a thing
Congratulations to the Lakers for winning the first ever In Season Tournament Lebron Showed us that he is the face of the lead AD show out like the way most fans wanted him too,Pacers deserved some applaud they have a bright future ahead of them.
This is a huge chemistry boost for the Lakers, and the perfect simulation of a playoff atmosphere for a lot of the young guys. The IST has been a huge success!

Also shout out to Cam Reddish. Dude has proven that he’s worth more that his contract with defense alone, and has potential to be a great 3 and D wing. Love to see it
Nothing but respect for the pacers......that was a great and hard fought game.
What a game they both payed hard and left it all on the court this is what the in season tournament is about. We don’t get this same level of energy and aggression from regular season games.
To the Lakers and the Pacers, big, big props to them for making it this far in the inaugural edition of the In Season Tournament NBA Cup! 

Hope they continue their good showing for many more months to come!
Having the Lakers win the first in season tournament is sooo good for the nba
Congratulations to LeBron James  and Los Angeles Lakers ! Thank you NBA  for a successful tournament! That was so amazing and entertaining. 🎈🎉🎊🎖️🏆😉😁
Wow, monster performance by the Lakers! Man LEking attacking like his prime; combined with AD the Lakers deserves. Congrats on both team! What a game.
This was actually fun to watch, I hope the NBA continues this. And congrats to the Lakers even though obviously the chip at the end is the goal for everyone, it's still great to be on this side of history as the *first* ever winner of this Tourny.
That 86 points in the paint is really really CRAZY!!! . History is made  Congrats Lakers .
This In-season tournament is s stroke of genius from commish. It hypes something tangible to look forward to in the lull of the winter season, and also provides the teams to up their competition as a dress rehearsal for the playoffs. I haven't seen intensity by AD like this for a long time. Its obvious the players enjoyed this level of competition for something.",17,Sports,21200000,PT10M1S

I'm glad to hear you have managed to find a suitable car to cut up for this epic build, now the fun can really start 🔥🔥
That long wait and look for that one specific vehicle is always a great feeling once you are able to find it!
Congrats Dave! Excited to see this build once it finished.
Shoutout to August for hooking it up all the time. Coming in clutch and then the simple “it’s done” 🤣

I can’t wait to see what you do to the 599. After you switched wheels with Damon and did the manual swap I started to really like that car. It would look sick with a kit and a huge wing.
I'm actually pumped for this build since you are hyping it up so much. I'd like to see some mods done on the interior as well though.
I couldn't be more excited about this Bentley build. Dave has really helped to make DDE a household name. I truly love ysob's

It belongs to a pliosaur, a ferocious marine reptile that terrorised the oceans about 150 million years ago.

The 2m-long fossil is one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered and is giving new insights into this ancient predator.

The skull will be featured in a special David Attenborough programme on BBC One on New Year's Day.

#Palaeontology #SeaCreatures #BBCNews",4052,"Wonderful to see Sir David Attenborough still active!  Bless you!
Thats looks like what a ""Dragon""skull would look like. Thats awesome
Beside the big fossil, let's not forget to admire the smaller one, the amazing 97 year old Sir David, still standing tall, rocking the boat telling us about it😮!.
Early sailors may have found things like this and imagined sea monsters were still alive in the oceans. Thiis is amazing !!
My God, I'm a fisherman in California and I've just realized that I sold a huge squid beak to Steve Etches several years ago!  He contacted me one day through my online ad saying he wanted one for his museum.  I had totally forgotten his name until I saw this report.  So honored to have one of my specimens on display in his collection to be viewed by (hopefully) many generations to come.
Paleontologists dream find, I don't think this short story can adequately cover the magnitude of how incredible this discovery was and how serious Steve Etches is when he says he could spend the rest of his life with this fossil
The amount of human and natural history in the UK is mind blowing ❤️🇬🇧
Wow, really amazing how well the skull is preserved! The teeth look amazing, I hope they find the whole fossilized pliosaur.
The Jurassic Coast is known for its rich fossil record, and this discovery is certainly significant
Yes, that is an amazing piece of history and a magnificent animal indeed. But guys? Sir David Attenborough is 97 years old! And he's on a swaying boat that makes most YOUNG people seasick. It is Sir David Attenborough that is the true beast of nature here folks. Seriously.
Fantastic! As a child I was fascinated with dinosaurs and their cousins. This still brings me joy !
Glad to see Sir David Attenborough healthy and still contributing to the world of documentaries.. I was some how emotional seeing him in this video🙏
If this was how terrifying life looked like millions of years ago on earth, Imagine whats out there in the universe in different shapes and forms. Absolutely fascinating
And this dwarfs the entire human existence!  Huge respect to these species to be able to go beyond millions of years!
Amazingly well preserved for a skull that big. Most of the time they are crushed to pieces and some of the pieces are just gone
I am in awe of this find. Having spent a few hours wandering along beaches on the Jurassic Coast I can imagine how excited the man who discovered this must have been. 
Fantastic find and a beautiful specimen.
Was great to be a part of this project! Hosting Sir David Attenborough on our boat, Snapper Charters was a real career highlight!
This reminds me a bit of that incredible Ankylosaur fossil that was basically perfectly preserved (pretty much the whole body, not just the head). 

And to think that fossilization in and of itself is already a very rare thing to start with, and then to have a fossil like this, is indeed incredible. I can't recall the statistic on this but fossilization is a process that occurs only something like 5% of the time any living animal dies, maybe less. Even if we were to unearth ALL the fossils from the crust of our planet today, it would only represent a very small fraction of all the possible animal species - that quite possibly - we'll never know about because it's possible that not a single specimen went through a 'successful' fossilization process.
I love this stuff!  I contemplated Paleontology for a bit, but instead went for my masters in Biological Anthropology.  I always geek out about these findings!!

Great video.  The hotel is  looking really good.  The water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist.
It’s crazy to watch how much progress you’ve made since 2020 the town looks great
We love your videos Brent, they dont all have to be well planned like they all are. You could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same. Thanks for being a content creator
I'm not an expert hiker or trail blazer, but I think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail.  It would be safer for anyone that want's to see that beautiful view of the valley.  Keep up the fantastic work Brent.  I'm hoping to be able to get to Cerro Gordo within the next couple of years.  Till then, I look forward to more and more video updates!
Brent, you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer. Blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees (leaving stone cairns) on a route for others to follow. Looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in Oz. Happy festive season mate
There’s nothing I want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
There’s something magical about the Sierras. I was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at Lake Sabrina. You can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning. The calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless.
Yes! Dan is awesome! Love his channel so glad he’s made an appearance
Bravo, Brent!  I'm so proud to have watched your first episodes of ""Ghost Town Living"" way back in 2020.  I never stopped!  Best channel on You Tube!  It never gets old!  Thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride.  I WILL get to Cerro Gordo one day and visit.  Congratulations on a great month and Merry Christmas!
Hey Brent what you are doing at Cerro Gordo is just simply amazing. I am  a retired water treatment, production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and I am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history.  Thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos, I am envious of your accomplishments!!
Cerro Gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately, but I'd love to visit if I had the chance. Your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from. It's amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life, especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on.
I’ve been watching since before the hotel burnt down and I’m so glad that it’s being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
Brent, your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch I never miss an episode. I would love to visit one day I am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun . Maybe one day I could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully I can visit in the near future. Cheers
Brett, you are truly an inspiration to me, and I'm sure many others. I admire your commitment to you're amazing project that you have taken upon yourself with the help of others. you have outstanding perseverance!!
It pleases me to pre-order your book. I now feel like I am just a small part of your world. I hope to visit and meet you someday.
   It is amazing that you have found your place in this world. And even more amazing that you are preserving history.
Blessings to you and your passions!!!
I think hiking trails are a great idea, that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly. Some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too, especially once you get a good supply of water on tap. Then the town could serve as a base camp, so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies.
Wow, what an incredible journey exploring an abandoned ghost town! Your determination and enthusiasm for discovering hidden treasures like gold and water are truly inspiring. The way you uncover the history and explore the nooks and crannies of these forgotten places is both fascinating and captivating.

Praying so hard for the family, as someone who's lost so many to cancer. Rest in peace, Anna. 🙏💕
My heart goes out to her children! I'm proud of her for speaking out against her mother and her molester. People are shocked by the boldness of predators. They some how get a rush from doing things in plain sight! You should never trust anyone 100% with your children! It's so sad that she died at such a young age.

My love goes out to her children and family. She has gained her angel wings and will always live on through their hearts.
We all know, that a parent should never have to bury their child. It's the most painful thing to go through. Godspeed, Anna..🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow, my condolences and 🙏🏾's to the entire family 😢.  This is so sad. She was so young. I hope this family stands together and doesn't  fall apart. I hope they stand strong and lean on each other. This is going to be a struggle for a while for this entire family. 😢 #RIPChickadee ❤

She is a beautiful soul. I am praying for her babies and loved ones. I pray they know she is watching over them and her love will never die. RIP Anna.

Can you find Bryton in each round before we do?
My challenge was crazy!! And I am so happy that Bryton is back home! ❤
So great to have Bryton back! I hope you guys can find him in the impostors! 😬
YES!!! I cannot wait to see what videos you guys make now that Bryton’s finally back. The channel is amazing, but it just wasn’t the same without him. I really hope you another Dino smashers video or one of those videos where it feels like you’re actually there. Those are awesome
5:05, Payton's comment and Ashton's reaction are so funny. Love you 🥰
Welcome back, Bryton. It's not the same without you, the best Ninja ever.
Amazing to have the blue ninja  back
Welcome back Bryton, and also when Payton said Ashton's muscles were a little small Ashton's face was hilarious.
I miss Bryton so much, so good to see him again
Let’s appreciate how much effort it takes to make these videos❤.  Great job guys!
How fun! Congrats Bryton on all your good work!
So happy you're home!
Its good to see you back with family...even when they were making videos without you...we felt a missing space there, I wonder how you managed to survive all these days without family as you have done everything with them ❤😊 . Like what Payton said and made Ashton mad😅 lol
So funny, especially when Ashton was in it😂
The prank you did to ur family, put a smile on my face ❤
The twist at the end was so so funny. I can't stop 😆
Brayton shares a close bond with his family. I'm overjoyed that he may return home.
its awesome to see that you still have a strong bond

In April 2019, the TV anime series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba first premiered with the Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc, followed by the release of the feature film Mugen Train in October 2020, and the TV series Mugen Train Arc and Entertainment District Arc from October 2021, and the Swordsmith Village Arc from April 2023.

#DemonSlayer #KimetsunoYaiba #Anime",2751,"this arc will be the calm before the storm
This arc is pretty cool, but manga readers all know how legendary the next will be
Edit: I think there will be one more arc after the next, or maybe just one big arc smushed together after this one
This is it guys, where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc, get yourself ready for what's coming next
This season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all 🔥
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc 😭 It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Hell yeah! Manga readers all know what's going to come next! The calm before the storm!!! 😤🔥🔥🔥
I can definitely see a lot of people not going like this arc due to the fact that it doesn't really have any great fighting sequence. But I don't care, The fact that this arc is the prime setup of one the greatest arcs in the entire series sends me shivers. Truly one of the ""calm before the storm"" moments.

And for any manga readers reading this, you know damn well that they are going to give us one of the biggest cliffhangers in the series, if you know what I mean.
Demon Slayer is absolutely a phenomenon to experience! It's been almost 5 years since the anime debuted and now after the the Hashira Training arc, we'll be officially 1 arc away (depending on how they animate the final one) from completing the anime. I remember watching the first episode only a few days after its release like it was just yesterday... I never imagined it would become this big!! I can't wait to experience all of what kny has before it ends ❤‍🔥
Happy to see all the Hashira in one frame. *2025 to Infinity Arc*
its crazy how big and popular Demon Slayer got in such a short amount of time!!
hyped for the new season!!
For manga readers out there, what im most excited for is when mitsuri is gonna explain how she got the mark. I LOVE THAT SCENE and cant wait to see the other hashiras backstory animated
A final happiness for us ds fans coz people are not ready for the next infinity castle arc its really gonna break the internet 🤧❤️🔥
I absolutely can not wait to see the arc after this get animated. It will be a legendary arc, and I get chills thinking about it.
This arc is gonna be awesome and can't wait next year
Tengen is sooooo beautiful here ❤❤❤❤❤ 
This arc in manga was pretty cool ! It will be the same in anime with a such good animation ! Thank u Ufotable ❤
My God, this masterpiece that I've been waiting for has finally come out, I don't know if the trailer is official for another hour? This is a dream.
This trailer gave me chills I am excited to know that the season will do.
It’s awkward to see there’s only 8 hashira’s right now.. And soon to be one 😭😭
BUT HEY!! THIS!? THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!🤗🤗
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc  It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Once this arc is over, now the real fun starts with some of the most epic fights/best story developments you've seen! (So excited for this to come along with the rest)",1,Film & Animation,703000,PT4M8S

I made this an in depth as possible to answer ALL of your questions; hopefully I got them all. Which Hero Equipment will you be using for your strategy? 

Town Hall 16 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLetRAmF0nLxuVjlriV36YCaqNA4VJYZtm
Here's the thing, the new wall levels take 9M for a single piece. But there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls, 4 which can shoot over walls. There is a jump and an earthquake spell, 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
I actually like this change because for me, the archer queen's spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible.
Im a little concerned about the epic equipment. Especially if its tied to events. It kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available.
I'm suspicious of the Epic equipment. If they are only available from special events, and much better than regular equipment, there's potential balance issues.
2:43 those Ore numbers are spectacular
Clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change. Absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes. Thank you Judo for always keeping us updated with juicy COC contents ❤❤.
I think this is really cool but I am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level. I really hope that levelling up your gear doesn’t take ages and ages. 

Additionally, I am VERY afraid of having “epic” gear that’s limited. I really hope that isn’t something that’s done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get. Anything limited atm is purely aesthetic, and doesn’t impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else. I hope they keep that in mind
I hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking, so you could startegize even further
for me, this is just an amazing feature, and something I would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects (cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops), by that knowledge, I think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic (like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that)
The vampire mustache, rage crystal, and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable. 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if DPS gets too high… can’t wait to try it out
Great stuff as ever! Will you be doing an upgrade priority guide? I know with most new TH levels it's the usual routine of TH, Lab, CC, Storages, Army Camps etc but this feels very different (and exciting!) e.g. with the Blacksmith. Would love some guidance.
I really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately. For instance, using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
It’s nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th16/15 changes
Thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo. Appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
Explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation, thanks!
With the epic equipment for events, as long as it doesn’t require money to get I think will be such a good idea. Make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
This is so awesome, its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new content.These are gonna change the game a lot, and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears.
This is phenomenal & provides you with ample content opportunities!  You could make a playlist of current & old strategies and how to gear the heroes to update/enhance those strats!  I'll be watching!",20,Gaming,2730000,PT19M30S

#OnePiece #Wano #Crunchyroll",1233,"I'm glad they showed off the seraphim's introduction as a threat because it really set the tone of how strong they truly are.
I like that Blackbeard is a villain who shows concerns and vulnerabilities.
He makes him more human and believable than the typical untouchable villains who seem to have everything under control like a god.
I like how this shows an emperor can even have a hard time dealing with the new pacifista
After years of being told ""you aren't ready for what's about to come"", I can confidently say ""yes, I am indeed, not ready""
Blackbeard is so unlikeable but that’s also what makes him such a good villain. I can’t wait to see his rematch with Luffy in the future 🤩
I am a Blackbeard stan. The dude is hilarious, powerful, opportunistic, and cowardly. ""Did you all get beaten by just one brat?!"" - pure comedy. Clearly the kid ain't normal boss 🤣😭
If this is what S-Hawk can do, imagine what Mihawk can actually do...
Dude, I still remember these chapters as if it was yesterday. Oda was straight cooking with hot grease!
If the Seraphims are modelled after the Warlords, it would be interesting to see Teach fight a younger version of himself
You know it's an abomination against nature because it has Mihawk's face but made an expression that wasn't a perma scowl or a delighted smirk
Blackbeard is shown to be a bumbling drunk at times but that man knows his lore and history in the One Piece verse, unlike most characters. He immediately picked up on the Lunarian traits
I cannot stress enough how refreshing blackbeard is as a villain knowing that he’s still exploring, growing, and making moves rather than just being a stagnant force like a lot of other OP villains have been
Considering that these new Seraphim-Pacifistas have biological qualities to them, it is likely that they are capable of getting stronger and learning from their previous fights as they age. So, if S-Hawk was to fight Blackbeard again, it would be better equipped and adapted to deal with him - much like Mahoraga from JJK🤔🤔
Watch episode 1087 here! https://got.cr/cc-op1087
Reminder that Blackbeard’s Dark-Dark Fruit makes all incoming attacks that hit him hurt more than it would any normal guy. Pre-timeskip he would’ve been crying out in pain and reeling on the floor. Just goes to show that even against a Seraphim Blackbeard wasn’t doing nothing for two years; he’s even more of a tank than ever.
I really like how they made the Seraphim completely silent. Really makes them feel otherworldly
Blackbeard has levelled up dramatically. He took on a slice that cut a mountain like butter, then blocked the next attack with his Haki. All this in spite of his DF amplifying the pain he feels.
Interesting enough to see Blackbeard dodging and moving swiftly pre time skip he would usually be a sitting duck to most attacks.
Blackbeard calling him big is right on point. If he is that size as a child and still developing, imagine how enormous and deadly they would be as adults. These pacifista are a potential threat for everyone not controlling them.
Love how Blackbeard is portrayed here. He's on the move and highly aware of his surroundings with quickly examining the new pacifistas. The Seraphim proved to be extremely powerful but Blackbeard held his own the entire time and maintained control of the situation. Even Whitebeard said he is always unprepared but that's how he rolls.",1,Film & Animation,5410000,PT1M48S

I'm not a fan of any of these actors but this trailer has driven me to watch the movie 🍿❤️
Siddhant and Adarsh are phenomenal actors no doubt. And Ananya's acting this time is also blending with their level. Great trailer!! 👏👏 I hope movie would be also good.
I think we can all agree that its an excel productions film and there's kalki. It has won our hearts already. No one can do movies of this genre better than the excel productions. Thank you guys for always giving us a film we deeply connect to.
Ananya is doing better day by day from student of the year to dream girl her acting skills are being better❤😊
This will be Anannya's  Second performance after dream girl 2 which will not  disappoint us..❤❤❤
As Siddhant Chaturvedi continues to take on diverse roles, his dedication to his craft is evident. Exciting to see what the future holds for this talented actor
Seems like this movie is going to give a good message to our social media addicted generation ❤
hats off to Ananya, the sheer 'hate' and 'negativity' she receives for no reason, I believe she is a real brave and strong person. And also her movies choices are getting better. Best wishes.
This cast just works. I can feel the chemistry from my screen, excited to watch it. Also Can I just say Ananya, Adarsh and Sid look so good.💙
This is going to be epic because it genuinely showed the reality of today's saddest generation ❤
Why such movies doesn't have a theatrical release. The trailer perfectly shows what's today's Gen is going through and not focusing on what they should be
Kudos to Siddhant Chaturvedi for bringing depth and authenticity to characters  looking forward to witnessing more of his incredible talent unfold on screen
In a world of constant change, Siddhant Chaturvedi remains a beacon of authenticity. His grounded demeanor and passion for his craft make him a standout in the film industry.
"" A Love Letter to Us"" ❤
Don't know how much this film would succeed with its timely and urgent exploration about us, specifically this generation. But this looks so promising to me, the charming screen with all shades of ourselves reflecting is relatively relatable. Watching the cast, like Siddharth, Adarsh, Kalki, etc, I'm hopeful something stirringly will be served duly…
Adarash iss a phenomenal actor,him doing diverse roles like this is the reason i love him so much 
Sid is solid too & seems like Anaya might kill it too 🔥
Appreciating Siddhant Chaturvedi's commitment to his craft  his dedication shines through in every scene
Siddhant's delivery of those intense dialogues is goosebump inducing
We needed this desperately. Thanks for creating something on this subject. As always, you can’t miss Siddhant or Adarsh’s movies anyway.

her vocals have improved so much better since Drivers Licence!
Her voice, her passion, her act , her melody, her story , her visual, everything about her is just perfect.
Imagine singing this live without backing tracks and just with your raw voice, this was absolutely hard!! Hats off to Olivia
her vocals, her high notes, literally everything about her is amazing.
her vocals is so amazing both live and in the studio
Olivia's vocals (live or studio) never fail to amaze me. This quiet but powerful version is amazing
This song is really hard to sing and I applaud her courage to sing this live❤
Was her singing perfect here? No. 
Did her singing move me? Yes
Her delivery, the lyrics, the piano, it moved me and I love her live versions of vampire.
I was so surprised to see she had no earpiece, she did so well!!!  What I really don´t understand though is people saying her ""vocals have improved so much"" like huh? She has always been this good live, maybe her confidence grew and her vocal techniques got better but she´s always been an incredible live performer.
Love this! Her talent has bloomed so dramatically in the past 10 years. Videos like this prove this to be true.
her voice is so perfect and angelic! love you Olivia XOXO can’t wait to see you in concert
her vocals really improved so much from the past years, great job mother liv!!!
Ik she has some voice cracks in this but the fact that she still sounds amazing live says something!! She sounds just like how she does in studio recordings. And nobody should hating on her for having voice cracks in her live performances, every singer has them sometimes, so don’t hate on our amazing Liv!! 💜
Olivia conveys so much emotion in every song. I love seeing artists perform with no gimmicks. Just a beautiful girl and her piano. Well done!
The amount of talent she has at 20!! I can't wait to see what she does in the upcoming years
What a trip. The comment section is totally astroturfed by bots. She was a little off key a few times and the sh-sh-sh style of vocals is unnecessary but it was a great performance. No auto tune is a good thing. Hearing mistakes makes it better because it’s genuine.
this performance feel so real, like her vocals expressions and just genuine felling in this performances is by far the best she's ever done
A voz dela é simplesmente incrível
Love this slow, intimate piano rendition of her song! A completely different take that felt more hurtful and somber. Just goes to show what a good actress she is",10,Music,201000,PT4M1S

Description (From Wikipedia) Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 - A Tight Squeeze, commonly known as Chapter One or abbreviated as CH1, is the first chapter for Poppy Playtime. It was released on October 13 on Steam. It revolves around the unamed player, an ex-employee of the toy manufacturing business Playtime Co. whose employees when missing abruptly one day, and receives a letter from an anonymous sender stating that 'we're still here'. This incites the protagonist to go back to the abandoned factory and investigate it to find out what is happening. Playtime Co. is a toy-making company, and the location where the game takes place. It was likely established in the 1950s, considering the aesthetic and lack of deeply advanced technology. However, the factory likely made its demise some time past the 80s depending. In this game, you play as an ex-employee of a company labelled ""Playtime Co."" Playtime Co. was once a corporate giant company that was in the toy manufacturing industry - that was until everybody inside the factory went missing. Now, years later, you return to the factory to investigate these unknown missing cases. One of the main mascots of PlayTime Co, he was one of the best sellers and found a place in the hearts of many children across the globe due to the fact that he was programmed to hug people, or because he was found to be cute. Nobody really knows what made him so appealing. However, due to experimentation on the toys at Playtime Co., a Huggy Wuggy seems to have come to life and gone rogue, killing everyone that crosses its path. The Player is the main protagonist of Poppy's Playtime and is the person you currently play as during Chapter 1: A Tight Squeeze. There is not much to say about The Player since we never get an introduction to who they could be. However, there's a recurring theory that the live toys, such as the murderous HH, were actually human experiments. There's a theory that the player has ties to whoever was running the operation, or looked similar to them, which is why they were so ferociously attacked. This is not canon, and this may be disputed later on as more lore is revealed. Poppy Playtime is a minor character inside Chapter 1, and will most likely be an important character for the upcoming chapters. Poppy is a highly intelligent toy, she has the ability to properly converse with a child. She's also programmed to talk and communicate like a real little girl. Her first debut is in Chapter 1 and is featured inside the first VHS tape the player receives in the game, in which she appears in her own commercial tape. The Grab Pack was shown to have been used by factory workers to do heavy lifting and general tasks that would have been hard for the average man to do alone, or even in groups. Not to mention, that in the chase scene, the player used it to pull a huge box over an entrance to deter a murderous Huggy Wuggy, and instead destroys the entire mesh floor with the box and takes Huggy Wuggy down with it. This shows that it's incredibly powerful, managing to pull down a box like that with ease. In VHS 2, it's also shown that it can easily decapitate a person with relative ease. In VHS 2, because of this, it was strongly advised to use these with care for that very reason. Decapitating your coworker is not ideal. (Steam Page) You must stay alive in this horror/puzzle adventure. Try to survive the vengeful toys waiting for you in the abandoned toy factory. Use your GrabPack to hack electrical circuits or nab anything from afar. Explore the mysterious facility... and don't get caught.",794,"I’d say, this is a good decision for Mob Games to delay chapter 3. I wouldn’t want this to be an unstable broken mess.
I'm just glad mob games are focusing on quality over quanity, and me personally they can take their time because the trailer is amazing and really shows that they're putting good effort into making this amazing game! They have stood their ground against other mascot horror games and it's great to see them actually putting in the work to make the fans happy. Mob games have really redeemed themselfs.
The graphics on this trailer is actually insane, I don’t care if I have to wait another year, this chapter will be amazing.
to me. chapter 3 being delayed is way better than it being released early-on. not only if it was released early, it would have alot of bugs. but its also after-christmas so most kids (including me :3) will get some christmas money as a gift that (i personally) will buy chapter 3 with. (if i get it)
I love the new area.  The painted walls and artificial ceiling projecting the night sky is very cool and very creepy with how Playtime's trying to simulate real life for the kids.

I think the character hanging in the cell is the bunny personally but MAYBE it's the dog. 

It's easy to forget, we didn't go back to the factory for the kids but for the staff.  With the talk of ""these children grow hungry"" I'm starting to think the children (whether in the right or wrong) are now the main antagonists of the story.
The trailer only came out 12 minutes ago jeez this man can work fast!
man, if you compare this, to the CH2 trailer it is 10 times better in everything. Graphics, lore and general vibe is so amazing that's definetly much more than I expected
It would be interesting if cat naps eyes were sensitive to light. Instead of only using a flashlight for dark areas maybe we can also use it to keep catnap further away from us.  One can imagine that a creature whose eyes are used to the dark would have difficulties with readjusting their vision when exposed to a bright light.
Definitely sad about the delay, but the gameplay trailer DEFINITELY compensated this alot! So excited to see, though I'm glad I'll be just watching people play this... dog characther looks terrifying xD
It's really disappointing that the chapter is delayed especially after they confirmed it's release this year multiple times but I'm sure went the game release it will be worth it
9:07 I believe this is mostly referring to the employees, since after Poppy says that she says “The ones who tortured us” (I believe). That (mostly) clearly means she is referring to the employees, or maybe even the head scientists
theory: because dogday is a ""heretic"" and was thrown in jail, i believe that the reason he's chasing after us is because he spent so insanely long in there that he needs to prove he's not a heretic by killing an actual heretic and adding it to the shrine thing. also he's gotta tend to his hungry needs-
I j realized I said the mailbox was boxy boo lmao my bad it looked like him xd
Sometimes it does suck when stuff our delayed but they made a good decision in my opinion.

The game looks really amazing. I can’t wait to see when it gets released.
Something that I hope is added is boss fights. Seems random to add into the game half way (presumably) but BatIM put bosses (that are mandatory) into chapter 4 while Dark Deception put bosses into chapter 3 onwards.
The room in wich the player puts on their gas mask to go in the red gas, looks like the room we find poppy in for the first time in her case.
I’m so excited for chapter three! I’m not really scared of poppy playtime, or other indie horror, but this genuinely sent a chill up my spine! At first when I watched the trailer, I thought that dog day who was tied up in this plush playground area/ prison for heretics, was buggy wuggy. I Hope we get to see huggy maybe help us along with poppy and kissy to take down 1006.
I hope the team takes rest after finishing chapter 3. They deserve it. If you are mad about delay, mob has been working a lot.
I have so much respect for them for giving us a proper apology that I’m not even disappointed about the delay tbh.
Having game devs leave is probably the reason behind the delay. I hope it’s worth it and all the hype surrounding the game. I had a feeling there would be a delay as well 😓 the full body version of catnap isn’t that scary either",20,Gaming,227000,PT12M

I can't wait for the day you can turn your king tower into an eagle artillery!
I can't wait to spend all of my family's savings on maxing out tower troops👍
To be honest, the new ""Cannon"" troop looks POWERFUL against tanks, but it's going to get annihilated by cycle, swarm, bait, GY decks. If it really has a 2.2 second attack speed, those are some FREE goblin barrels. It's probably gonna be costly to level up, but it doesn't seem ""advantageous"" to me. Just feels more Rock/Paper/Scissors if anything.
Can't wait to start hoarding troop cards to level up my Princess towers one level in every three years! I wonder what else fun they are going to do in future years, maybe make the King a card and make us pay even more.
Tower Troops seem like a really bad idea since this would counter win conditions at random and make matchmaking even more luck based. For example, if they add a splash damage tower troop, skeleton barrel perishes on the spot.
The warmth challenge is one of the most interesting challenge I've seen
Every card feels balanced around how much damage Spells, the Princess Towers and defensive buildings do to them. The moment any one of those aspects are changed heavily, the meta will definitely be torn from the ground up into something new.
Supershell never fails to disappoint ❤
I can't believe we gotta now pay to upgrade our towers 😂
What is supercell thinking?
I like how OJ deeply analyzes the Troop Tower video when he can justo wait for the oficial video in a few weeks. Algo great description of the warmth spell 😂
The warmth card/snowstorm is a brilliant idea! I've always felt like there should be something in each arena to make each of them unique (rain doesn’t count).
I just noticed that the warmth spell is able to heal Crown Towers.
Can’t wait to use this to chesse close match overtime .
Honestly OJ analysing the frames is actually really helpful
Warmth spells heal princess towers and probably king towers aswell, I also can't wait for evolved firecracker on the princess tower😊
Actually, Magic archer is quite op in this challenge because if your opponent keep stacking things you can use the 

POWER OF GEOMETRY
Introducing the warmth spell really makes me think that you can possible make a puzzle level with it; having already frozen troops on your and the opponents side. This would honestly only be possible if there were like an evolved mirror where I used the card on both sides😊

Doug's heart rate being 20bpm lower than mine shows that a well oiled heart is important
Chat:”Doug do a small dance” *Doug proceeds to dance violently knocking down his green screen*
There is never a moment where you feel disconnected from Doug, his viewer interaction is Completely Unmatched
The way chat just said “let him cook” well they were playing rock, paper, scissors was hilarious
I'm amazed he kept his heart rate down when CHEESEWHEEL GAMING was on screen. What a trooper.
Don’t you just love Doug’s CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments? Fucking incredible
I sure do love it when Dough pours his CHEESEWHEEL GAMING all over his viewers
The voice for the spawning bot is perfect
I love the part where Doug said CHEESEWHEEL GAMING and he cheesewheeled all over us
My favorite part of the video is when Doug said “ITS CHEESEWHEEL GAMING TIME”, and CHEESEWHEEL GAMINGing on all the bad guys
I love how much effort Doug puts into his

The harmonious ending supporting Doug's venture was truly CHEESEWHEEL GAMING so inspirational

I was at the edge of my seat when that CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moment happened. Good thing Doug stayed so calm!
Love how Doug's CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments are always amazing to watch even while having so much cheese.
It was a real experience to watch this live. The tragedy of so many lives lost to trucks will never be forgotten, and we will always have CHEESEWHEEL GAMING to remember them by.

It has an electric motor that powers the front wheels exclusively and a stingray’s 6.2L V8 powering the rear. Combined they make a powerful 655 horsepower and Chevy claims a lightning fast 0-60mph time of just 2.5 seconds. But who is the prospective buyer of an E-Ray according to Chevrolet? And how is it to drive and live with, especially in regards to its similarly priced but much more riotous Z06 counterpart? Thomas and James are excited to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

#Corvette #V8 #AWD",862,"This car deserved to be in the main channel
James' wit and observation skills is faster than a z06. Coming up with that cor- Vette joke and observing the  synchronous clap in real time is crazy sharp. Always fun listening to these 2.
I think they did a perfect job electrifying the corvette, even with all the downsides. I would 100% buy the zo6, but as a hybrid stingray, it’s pretty good
Thomas and James give us more info in 11 minutes than normal people do in an hour, and funnier😂😂
""It's a corolla in the front and a vette in the back.. put it together it's a corvette😂😂😂. Then Thomas's late reaction.😂 amazing video guys.
The difference between this and a Z06 is the same between a 911 Turbo S and a GT3 RS. Very similar price tag, completely different use and customer target.
I really love how the Cockpit and Interior looks, it legit covers you in with all kinds of buttons and screens pointing towards you making it feel like a spaceship, they do interior better than most other Supercars
Who the hell is editing a Extra Throttle House upload! 😂  Seriously guys,  i LOVE both of your channels.  You make me laugh amd giggle everytime, besides the wonderful production quality!
Cheers from Vienna , Austria boys,  keep up the fantastic work
The editor for the ""definition of hybrid"" bit had me rolling, thanks for the work all of your employees do to continue to bring these videos to the masses and for giving me something to watch while I eat my Mcdonalds in the morning
Back in the 1970's there was a British car called the Austin Allegro which objectively a terrible car but it had a quartic steering wheel which was so roundly mocked by the press and public that they changed it to a round one. 50 years later and the squared off wheel is everywhere.
That Corolla in the front and Vette in the back joke was incredible. Well done.
The fact that this video is Extra Throttle house and not even a ""real"" produced and scripted video is so impressive.
Listening to them talking about this feels so natural. Just good!
I had not even considered this to be the Chevy NSX Type S, but you're exactly right.  Now I want Honda to build the Acura Z06.
James' comical wit is pro level and Thomas' enjoyment of said wit makes the whole thing so fun to watch
""That sounds like a good place to conclu..""
Top tier editing.
Regardless of the rest of the car, I absolutely love the wheel design.  Reminds me of Ferraris from 15-20 years ago.
The benefit of the eray over the z06 would be probably more obvious on a wet road than in these perfect conditions… great review!
The content is gold, they answer all the questions I'd ask, the ones I should have thought of AND they leave me in stitches with these jokes 😂 Best automotive show/channel on YT right now
I love what they've done with this, but I'd still take a Z06 every day and twice on Sundays.  That FPC is just too good.
Would love to see a full throttle house review of this car! I’m number one on my dealers list and the biggest reason I’m choosing this over a z06 is simply because an z06 is impossible to get here. I’ve been patiently awaiting your review of the eray this just feels like a tease lol 😂.",22,People & Blogs,264000,PT11M27S

Sonny played perfectly today! Congrats on having double digit goals for 8 consecutive seasons Sonny!!!❤🎉
This is how our wingers supposed to play just like today's winger Son
Absolutely quality assists from Son. Legend.
Son is what most clubs need from their forwards. He creates fluidity and chances for everyone in the attack, and works hard to position himself to score.. what a guy ❤
Congratulations tottenham.  I love this team
Son assisted as a winger and scored as a striker in one game. What a master class
As a Liverpool fan but also congratulates Tottenham. Son had an excellent match playing as a left wing striker with 1 goal + 2 assists. What a legend, what a match
2 assists and 1 goal! Accomplishment of double digit goals in this season, which means 8 consecutive seasons. Nice one Sonny!
No quality providers for Son as a striker, so Son falls back and provides for others to score. 
Spurs always lacked that quality and that's why Kane and Son were the main providers and goal scorers for each other.
Their record is something but that also tells about the team as well.
Sonny's responsible for 3 goals today. Just amazing. He'll be missed so much when he's gone. So much fun to see him play.
Son was there in every goals. Outstanding.
Sonny was a young player who always shed tears when his team was defeated in a crucial moment while playing in Korea in his 20s. Now in his 30s, he is leading the team as a captain and doing his best to make sure young players don't feel what he has been through. He is one of seven players in Premier League history to score double figures for eight consecutive seasons.
Whether he is a winger or a striker, sonny is an irreplaceable player.
Son's dribbling is just incredible.
SON, what a player, what a legend.
Sonny is a living legend....Amazing!
Sonny is also a player who can play a role in penetrating the team's blocked blood vessels.Sonny's key pass is fantastic.Congratulations on Sony's double-digit goal for the eighth consecutive season.

Nice video Mate

Without body you look like rayman... considering he's apparently a secret agent and extremely cool. Using his floating detatched hands really effectively. That's a compliment... but you lost your ""looking like one of the strongest video game characters"" status when you got arms... also it was in an anime. So cool. Rayman is an anime character now. Which quadruples his power because you're not locked to game rules and make those mfers yourself.",20,Gaming,1890000,PT26M13S

For me, your videos are not vlogs, but more like coming over to a friend's house to share in life. A cup of tea, a good walk, and wonderful, meaningful conversation. I always feel so grateful and calm, so grounded after. Thank you so much for the depth of your sharing.
I've been a chef most of my life and a baker for about half my career...I have never enjoyed watching someone bake as much as I've enjoyed watching you now. It brings me back to times and reasons why we spend time in the kitchen especially during the holidays...it's the joy and fun of just making something wonderful.  Thank you for reminding me about the spirit of the holidays and bringing me back to my childhood of baking things with my mom!! Much love and God bless!! As always!!
Jonna, dont ever feel like you HAVE to do big things on this channel for us, we are all here to just have a relaxing cozy time with you. Whatever you put out comes out beautiful no matter what you do. 
Decorating home and just doing ''small'' stuff like that is so cozy and authentic.
Do not put insane expectations on yourself for us, we are here for YOU and your day to day life. <3
Merry christmas and a happy new year to you and your family!
This was 100% the Christmas video we all needed!
The idea to hang the jewelry out in the trees to soak up the energy of the forest is so wonderful Jonna. ❤️
What a special Christmas tree!!! Full of jewellery instead of baubles and not cut down but left in its full splendour in the garden... I LOVE it!
Dear Jonna, dear Johan, dear family in the north of Sweden,

over the past years you have created a variety of videos which have touched me on a deeper level. This video is yet another one bringing me in touch with my emotions. I can't put into words how grateful I am for your channel and from a higher perspective also for the way of living you have chosen. Your video felt like a warm hug for me. It was exactly what I needed. My beloved father died on November 19th, 2023 and it hasn't been easy to create a new life for us with this loss. I know he is still with us in spirit. 
Thank you so much, dear Jonna and Johan, for creating such a cosy atmosphere and embracing Christmas season. 
I am sending you love as well, for you and all your loved ones.
I  so grateful to the girl that bagged my groceries a few years back and told me about this channel. Ever since I get these rare moments of enchantment. 
If ever there was a place that lends itself to the beauty of Christmas decorating it is this far away , mystical woods where we find Jonna and her loving husband.
Each time she uploads And unlike any other channel I watch I get rid of any other distractions and my seriously chaotic brain settles in for what is sure to be a lovely respite from my world!  
I thank you Jonna for doing everything so beautifully for us ESPECIALLY when you are both under the weather!
I love how comfortable Johan is on camera now. I love to see the two of you interact and all the love that is shared between the two of you.🙏🏻🤗🎄
As someone who lives in Greece, the coldest weather I have been to is 0 C degrees. And that feels so cold!! I can't imagine how -21 is like!! Thank you for everything Jonna, your energy, for capturing the beauty of nature and sharing it with us, for the happiness and coziness you bring to our home!!! For the joy you bring to me and my sister!! We always enjoy your videos together and every time we dream of experiencing snow, northern lights, beautiful skies and all the Nordic beauty!! Really, thank you so much!!! Merry Christmas to you and your family!!♥ :))
Sending well wishes. How sweet to hear your husband express gratitude for your effort in cleaning. Its the little things.
Dear Jonna, most of all I like you for NOT trying to be perfect, but just for being yourself! This is what makes your place not just another social media channel, but a cosy place where everyone is welcomed as a dear friend. Greetings from Saint Petersburg, it's also cold and snowy here! Anna.
This is the most sweet and cute Christmas preparing video I ever saw - so perfect in it's imperfectness, so full of love and humanity, deep cosy emotions and humour - wow, I 'm really moved of your kind personality and personality and how you both harmonize together. Thank you for letting us in, although you were sick (I am not able be so busy when I am healthy 😅🙈) and from my heart I wish you a wonderful Christmastime! And YESSSS - I will embrace it, too 😊🎄❤️
This might be a new favourite way you do videos ❤ Don't get me wrong I love your adventure videos up into the mountains or the city, but the slow life ... that's something we all need desperately! And I feel you, was sick and had a week off never been more creative drawing from early to late because nothing was acquired of me 😄😊
Tack fina ni för att ni bjuder in oss i erat liv 😍🌟
“It’s new times now; we want the wrinkles!” 😂 Johan is such a supportive partner. 💯 Merry Christmas all!!
I was just reading some of the comments. It really feels such a privilege to be part of your community, Jonna  and Johan! Please don't stress, we all love you and love your vlogs, the long ones and the shorter ones. Have a wonderful Christmas Jonna, Johan and the whole community!❤",22,People & Blogs,5040000,PT39M20S

Brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
por primera vez estoy muy emocionada por la actualización❤ pero en serio me siento mal por que ya no podré conseguir el brawl pass con gemas 😢😢 pero al menos se compensa un poco con la mejora que le pusieron a las recompensas gratis,
aún así gracias supercell❤❤
The star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past. The fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all..

Ojalá y agregen mas recompensas a en la cuestion del nivel de experiencia ya que es algo que esta olvidado en el juego desde siempre y estoy seguro que muchos ni saben de eso, solo se han enfocado en el camino de trofeos
When will the new warrior kit arrive?
Essa atualização tá incrível, só que eu não estou conseguindo a sequência de vitórias, ontem eu estava conseguindo mais hoje não
Hola supercell, tenía unas cuantas preguntas , les agradecería si pudieran aclarármelas , un saludo y gracias 
Para la gente que ya hayamos conseguido las 50000 copas no hay stardrops legendarios ? , la recompensa antigua era mucho peor a la de ahora ….

Kier keeps playing with fire at this point dev might make another torture manhunt
The amount of dedication they put in this is more I could put in anything
Why does Dev always get the most infuriating challenges...? 😂😂😂😂
You know it’s gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
Dev started as a hunter, and when he got detached, he still decided to be speed runner XD
I would love to try some of these challenges myself. They seem fun. But my computer can barely handle running Minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting, never mind multiplayer high paced PVP related stuff. Also, I can’t speedrun, so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this.
I love how intense this video was, and then the end was the most anti-climactic thing ever
“it was supposed to be fun.. like friends work together.” actually kinda hit me in the feels. feels bad man
Kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isn't a bad twist, imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
You know, I'd love to see a Manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking. I.e. Trading doesn't give pearls. Enderman only spawn in the overworld. Water+Lava source gives cobble. And have Dev be the speedrunner. Maybe then he'd be Kier's speed <3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions. in a good way, of course
I'm so glad boosfer finally agreed to do a manhunt
This is my favorite color crew video in awhile. It was very funny and a completely different unique idea compared to most manhunt twists currently. Also having Boosfer in a manhunt must have taken a lot of bribe money.",20,Gaming,1100000,PT21M40S

Alan deserves an Oscar award
The Cowboy hat was clever. At first I thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until I realized it also was there to contextualize TSC's rotational position in 3D space, since otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape, which most of them were.
If you could turn this format into a video game, you'd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics.
Please never stop doing these. Biology, Chemistry, Logic, History, anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation. Thank you.
For a spiritual seeker physics student, this is emotional❤
As a physics student I can say that this is amazing! I see we’re going for an “interstellar” interpretation of singularities, which is cool to see as well.
Alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
This was absolutely stunning to watch. I can’t wait to see what comes next!

Maybe an “Animation VS Chemistry”? 

Chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise, and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts.
Genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts. It's like a whole season of Bill Nye compressed to the size of a single episode. You would make an excellent teacher
One of the most relaxing videos I have ever seen. Proud to say I learned something from this, and glad to know I get to exist at the same time as this. All the work you've done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given.
As a guy who loves physics, I absolutely love this, from classical mechanics to general relativity, then quantum mechanics. Alan and his team are do amazing job at this
Absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation. I absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works, keep up it up! You and your team are absolutely amazing!
Woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown! Just like in Math, Physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity, acceleration, friction, gravity and many more. I honestly love how you visualize every details that some people don't know which is crazy. I remember learning Physics during my high school years until college. I know that it sounds really difficult to understand but I'm sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics. Thank you so much, Alan Becker and the whole team for making this animation. I hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals. 🤯👍
I'm loving these new new animations.  There is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time.

Amazing job and I can't wait to see what's next!
As a Civil Engineering major (junior), this and ""Animation vs. Math"" have brought me to tears. BOTH of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why I'm still passionate about what I'm studying. Thank you <3
This is one of the most impressive things I've seen on YouTube in a while. Respect to the team behind it.
This is by far my favorite animation on this channel, it’s so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully. You deserve a damn Oscar for this
Spectacular animation, as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that I've learned, and for the ones that I have yet to learn, it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction, the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is, and why it is being used in the manner that it is. One particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist, for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort, the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there, and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions.
This video was a masterpiece from start to finish. It has wonderful animation, a mere loud story, the way you played with lighting and music was genius, and it shows the way physics work in a marvellous and fun way, both what we know and what we don’t. 10/10.",1,Film & Animation,25500000,PT16M8S

Arshin Kulkarni opens the batting and bowls medium pace - one to watch out for! Musheer Khan, brother of Sarfaraz Khan, is another exciting young allround talent. And Sachin Dhas looks like a good striker of the ball.

For Pakistan, Azan looks like a replica of Fakhar Zaman, such an exciting talent. And Zeeshan has height, pace, and that typical Pakistani pacer aggro. Very excited to see how these boys go in the near future!

You know Pakistan cricket is at its best when they are catching well and fielding well.. Though some of the catches weren't that difficult still they were commendable considering they are young..
What a fabulous and fantastic performance by all these youngsters in all three departments bating, bowling and fielding❤❤🎉. Congratulations, you made my day champs.
Ramiz Raja deserve credit for this. He started junior league which provided plsteform and opportunity to these youngesters. It also gave them opportunity of cricket as career path. Sadly it was wrapped after him in just political animosity. Sadly it is the story of whole Pakistan, one right step in forward direction followed by two in wrong direction.
This U19 Pakistani team has more courage and hunger for winning than our current sifarishi team. I hope it stays this way and they get to play in our national team.
Well played Pakistan🇵🇰

Great to see young kids playing fearlessly. Many more victories to come.
Great show by the young guns! Wonderful display of talent and skills. 🇵🇰

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg. im sure they were so happy that he joined them, soooo adorable
Ryan risked losing his Apple Watch just to test a review. Mad respect
The fact that Ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane.
I was cracking up from start to finish. Thanks man, I needed that 😂
I always worry about content creators' ettiquette when they're recording in public. It fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers :)
I went on the Harry Potter ride many times, but this one time I did actually get stuck for a few minutes. The people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so I could go on again without waiting. I have to say it was worth it 👍
Watching Ryan and his dad have fun at the place they've talked about going together for so long is really heart-warming <3
As someone who's been to Universal Studios once and loved every second of it, I was shocked to learn it had such a low review score. I guess the waiting just doesn't bother me that much, since I'm already used to Disneyland waiting time.
I don't know why but asking the kid if she knew Janelle made me laugh so hard. And then you saying she is upset and the kid going ""oh""... comedy gold.
*Ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist! 🎉*
I love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh. 😂
Universal Studios is very popular so there is a reason why it’s so packed and that the lines are so long. There really isn’t anything the workers can do to change that. The main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line. Some lines are kinda crazy. Of course there are a few rides in the Harry Potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties. The ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride. Whenever I’ve gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
Ryan Trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content, he took this to an absolute infinity win.
I agree with Mark, we got stuck on the Harry Potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out. I was scared and didn't know anybody else on the same coaster. So, I just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere.
i watch your videos on regular days, but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad. i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better. thank you ryan
Ryan never fails to make me smile 😁
I just love how ryan talks to people without being hesitated or nervous :)

I was not a Luton fan.  In fact, it had been years since I watched Luton played.  With a small fraction of the budget and ticket sales, you pushed Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City to the brink.  You have turned me into a supporter of yours.  I am sure their are many like me.  Proud of Luton FC!
I am Manchester City fan but you have to appreciate and give credit where its due.Luton played well.
as  a LIVERPOOL FAn so happy for you guys plz do whatever you can to stay in the premier league fight as hard as you can tooth and nail stay in this i saw the reaction your fans gave when you scored amazing stuff lads plz keep this momentum going.
Brighton fan here, Barkley and Kaminski are just impressive, well done Luton!
It's amazing how much Rodri is crucial to Man City!
Wonderful match.. congratulation to city
I am a City Fan, but Luton is a great team with great mentality!! keep on going, Luton Town!!
Man city fan here, well played Luton! That was one of the best matches in a long time.
Amazing build up to that first goal for Luton. Amazing job Barkley!",17,Sports,95600,PT2M33S

@HopeScope on TIKTOK for some laughs",3064,"Does this mean we're getting an ""I Bought Every American Girl Doll"" video? Because I would definitely watch that.
I find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because I still see them every year.
We loved having you and your team out to the Electric Starship Arcade. Thank you for hanging out with us Hope!
As an American Girl Doll collector, you did AMAZING at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls. I’m so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again!
As a professional baker, i’ve made a barbie cake like that before. A few tips for the next time, wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in, less mess that way, also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 😊
Love how you called the newer Polly Pocket's clothes 'chewy'. 😂
I could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the Mary-Kate and Ashley mall game. I would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood!!
Hey Hope! That Polly was original but the castle is actually a Star Castle! I had that exact one. Equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely it's own vibe ✨️
As a kid, I had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s Samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what I was working toward. After months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house, she was finally mine! 😊
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my Target for Halloween this year. They bring them back every year for the holiday, so I was surprised to see them in here lol
I had the tiny Polly Pockets and Rollerblading Kira!! She was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything. The essence of 1991. I had no idea they were discontinued, but they basically work just like a lighter lol 😂
I wanted a Samantha doll more than anything as a kid. Her books were the reason I started to love to read ❤️
I love seeing how far Hope has come I remember watching y’all her videos in order and I would get sooo excited when I got a notification saying she posted and I still get as excited.I wish you good luck on reaching 4M.
I was 30 in 2004, but the Mary Kate & Ashley game still got me. The graphics were crazy, lol. I remember my children wanting some of these items, lol. Thanks, Hope!😊
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
Actually loving all the background changes in this video ❤ it made it much more animated and fun!
I legit had that rollerblade Barbie!! She was my favorite! I also think AG dolls were better overall quality when Pleasant company was still in control. The most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing. Everything was so true to life with little clasps and now it’s all cheap Velcro but for the same price .. also the dolls were made in Germany back then .. not China.
I wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious & I love seeing childhood products I never got to have. if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
For the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones, you can find them at target. It made me so happy to see 😊
My daughter actually loves Polly Pockets! They make them in different varieties now. There are ones with the “chewy” clothes lol. Another with the hinge bodies, and others with plastic/silicone forms called Micro Polly- that’s the small compact versions. ❤️❤️",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S

I think the attack speed getting reduced on Charlie was the icing on the cake because in reality none of the other nerfs mattered if she can still spam her main attack
The amount of effort you put in behind the scenes to get us the data is awesome and underrated
Honestly we really need an Olympics again. It would be cool to just see where every brawler is with all of the Olympics Kairos has made
The amount of joy I felt while hearing all the nerf to Charlie was like waking up to gift's under the Christmas tree  😸😸
SUBSCRIBE for Mico, Kit, & Larry sneak peeks!
5v5 looks insanely fun it's the mode I've been looking forward to the most
I noticed that when you were testing Lou’s super charge rate on the before side Lou had his epic (supercharge) gear equipped, I think this could have affected the outcome but idk.
Lets all thank Kairos for putting so much time and effort for all these amazing sneak peaks!!!
00:02 Update includes progression buffs for free-to-play players and new balance changes.
01:53 Edgar's hypercharge provides increased supercharge and reload speed.
05:19 Several brawlers are receiving significant buffs to their attack damage and health.
07:12 Buffs and nerfs to various brawlers
10:43 Brawl Stars update brings changes to game modes and introduces optional in-game ads.
12:32 Brawl pass system changes and updates
16:05 New system brings significant buffs for free-to-play players
17:34 Free-to-play players getting a 13.2% buff to coins
20:44 The new Brawl Pass offers more gems, free credits, and extra perks.
22:22 Brawl Pass Plus offers 96% more coins, 79% more power points, and exclusive perks.
25:35 Chroma credits will be converted to regular credits, affecting the cost of buying chromatic Brawlers
27:19 New skins showcase and details
30:56 New skins and animations for different brawlers
32:44 New skins and upgrades coming in the update
every time this man uploads i think of how much work he actually puts into this. The math and everything
32:54 It really looks like he's firing Power Points with his main attack. (and I also love the fact that Cil turned into a Starr Drop)
I love the direction this game has been going as a whole but as a long term player I hope down the road they make a prestige progression system with exclusive rewards down the road. I hope this game never dies. I always look forward to the brawl talks and podcasts. I’m so happy there only monthly seasons now!
I feel like Charlie  will never be under B or C tier, even after the nerfs, her super is still pretty easy to charge and the fact its a 5 second stun (since ppl rarely seem to help get their teammates out of the cocoon anyway) is still very good, her dps on long range will probably be almost the same, her attack is still pretty fast and easy to hit. but i do like the fact shes not a must pick anymore.
Love to see my favourite ever mobile game get such a good update, and such regular updates, they are always trying new things and adding stuff
Thanks for always making excellent and informative content ❤
I think the most oppressive part about Charlie was honestly her projectile speed. It is incredibly easy to land shots, and hard to dodge. And since she doesn't have normal ammo, this means she can just just you down and never stop chipping you down. Nerfing her projectile speed would also indirectly nerf her super charge... I do think her super should be straight up reworked, but that's a different topic. Nerfing the spiders and her minimum reload time are both very much welcome though.
Kudos to Kairos for making this video
what a huge amount of content you have to cover!
I’m super excited for that mortis buff. Mortis has been and is still my favorite character in the game and this simply means that he’s going to be able to get that extra healing off 50% quicker which if he’s in a big bundle of enemies then he’s just gonna be able to heal that much quicker.
I do really appreciate how kairos does these videos and how he makes calculations for everyone so they can see how the value of their money translates. But when he talks on buying every brawl pass in the old system I feel we should consider even most paying players but every other pass with gems so his stats for that seem a little off to me personally.",20,Gaming,1050000,PT34M22S

WE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  

We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.

Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  

We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.

Our journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity

© Gone With the Wynns 2023",1447,"Jason is getting a dishwasher…Congrats on the new boat. Looking forward to all the new adventures.
Tool Time with Tim was everything! Sorry for the delay! I can’t wait to be virtually sailing with you guys!
Love Y’all!Home Improvement was one of my favorite programs! Can’t wait to see y’all’s first sailing video on the open water!!!!
It’s a process you wouldn’t want any other way but to be right.  Enjoy the journey ❤️ Hugs for overcoming the challenges ⛵️
This is fantastic, it’s about time - good people deserve good things!
Dear Jason and Nikki, Congrats on this most crucial of all milestones: perfect flotation! She looks STUNNING! I hear your frustration and sense your months of inner exhaustion, from anticipating her birth and yet, despite your readiness, she's gonna be born when she is ready, not when anyone else is ready. But that's the beauty of it!! It will ALL cone true, and all be worth it! Meanwhile, luckily you two are incredibly practiced at unpredictable waiting. It's one of your superpowers! You're just stuck in the world's most unpredictable weather window right now, waiting to depart, but the weather keeps changing, and it's all out of your control. May you draw on your inner strength! It's expectation -- the set up and the disappointment -- that makes it so emotionally exhausting to you. For us? We're just here for the ride, and we're not going anywhere. So *please* don't worry about pleasing anyone other than yourselves! May you just do what you need to do to take care of you. Sending support and all the positive energy from across the world. ❤Lee
We started with travel trailers and are now building a boat, pretty much because of you guys. We took your advice to heart and have learned to sail and are building up our miles and skills before we pick up our own boat. Great to see how this whole process is unfolding. Took last week’s break as an opportunity to go back and watch your first couple of months of sailing videos- how far you have come!
Limbo living is always such a challenge.  I’ve experienced it a few times in my 77 years and I now know it was a teaching/learning time for me. I admire the way you two are handling it all with such grace and putting it to good use. So very eager to see the next step! I’ve been following you since your very early RV days and it’s always been a joy. Peace to you both. ❤
I noticed no props or bottom paint so then realized the process is ongoing. I was able to watch the commissioning of our new monohull sailboat back in the day. A very interesting and exciting process indeed. Congratulations and glad to see they are making sure everything is done correctly.
Love all your videos! This build has been an adventure to watch (can just imagine what your ""adventure"" feels like). As to e-bikes, I'm a private pilot and have a few pilot friends that have e-bikes they ftake on their aircraft (so lightweight, foldable, relatively small package when folded, durable, etc.).. They've recommended Stark Drive, Montague M-E1 and Brompton e-bikes. Not sure if any fit your specs/needs, but may be worth at least a look.
Your episodes NEVER fail to leave us with anticipation of the next one. Fascinating process. I was intrigued by the stepp ed process of checking systems and installing panels in a particular and necessary order. Thanks for the invitation, looking forward to the next video. Be well Niki and Jason, real close to sailing this jewel on your own....can't wait for those episodes.
I'm sure I can speak for many of your fans in saying, we love you! I understand it can be hard large life events going not quite so perfectly. I've gone through some similar things building a barn. But I know the wait is going to be worth it, you'll be so happy. We're all here to support the both of you as you follow your dreams, through the good, the bad, and the delayed. I know it can be hard but keep keeping your heads up, you should be proud.
I'm so excited for you and can also feel and see your disappointment on yet more delays. Thank you for showing us the reality and some of the emotion behind all of this. I'm eagerly awaiting next week's episode. Thank you for taking us on this journey with you.
It is all just a part of the journey of building our own boat. The more you are there, the more you learn, and the better you will know your own boat. Thanks for letting us be a part of your lives.
Congratulations on getting the boat in the water for the first time. That was so exciting.
You two are so down to earth in contrast with your shiny new yacht it’s a beautiful thing ❤we need more stories about reasonable people making it ❤
You guys are awesome!  It’s amazing the time and thought you put in to making great videos!  Keep up the great work!!😊
Sorry that you've had so many things to challenge your happiness, but great job of presenting the realities of this process.  Looking forward to seeing y'all on board and testing everything out ahead of your future great adventures.
I have been watching your videos for several years, and find them so very interesting. Watching how much you have learned and accomplished is highly entertaining. Thank you!!

#kurtisconner",7115,"when i see a new kurtis upload i jump up and down and squeal like a little pig
thinking we’d actually get a barbie analysis from kurtis was too good to be true
I understand the trilogy has come to an end… but a bonus round comparing Barbie video games to Bratz video games is kind of warranted.

i loved that kurtis reverted back to POC women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt POC women. an ally through and through
""How dare thee call me a wizard"" has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
I don't think I'm ready for the Barbie vs. Bratz series to end.
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i haven't skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a Barbie girl from childhood to now, I am PRAYING for a new and/or “remake” of the Bratz live-action. Barbie was PHENOMENAL for what it was, imagine what we could have with BRATZ?! And to add: we NEED a better monster high live-action. I said what I said.
So glad the microchips line that's been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves.
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece. it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
Literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved Lifesized as much as many of us did.
Congratulations on being sponsored by Pokémon!!! So proud and happy for you!!
As a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with Bratz
Glad the “you dont have a daddy OR a bankaccount” line got the recognition it deserves. Been on my mind for years 😭💀
as a hispanic person, yasmin's part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
You should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more, please and thanks. Target audience reached.
idc how “bad” the bratz live action is, it will always be part of my core memories

He couldn’t get her!!! She balanced his sarcasm equally!
She’s so chill, he couldn’t make her get out of character lmao. Team Jaidyn 💕
Idk how you can’t like this girl, she just so chill and goes with the flow. 🦋🦋
I’m glad she’s doing these interviews. She’s very likable once she interviews solo. She has a nice personality.
The way Marco just be cutting them off like ""vibe check"" is hilarious 😂😂😂
She was not intimidated at all… 😂 she played her cards right with Marco. He couldn’t get her out of character and she matched his energy & sarcasm. She’s so cool and chill. She seems like she would be a good friend. With being with a narcissist Ike Blue face for so long, no one can manipulate her lol
When he looks at the camera with the blank stare i can't stop laughing 😂😂😂
Everyone needs to realise she has been a stay at home regular mother like all the other woman. She is very realistic and doesn’t let her emotions control her opportunities its nice to see her still getting out there after the embarrassment blue put her through!✌️ props to this lady❤️
I'm glad she's doing these interviews by herself and not in a toxic environment. We can finally see who she really is. Love this for her. <3
When he asked her what's the best way to quit a job and she said ""just quit fuck it"" I felt that 😂
Keep your head up Jaidyn. I always thought she was unproblematic, she just fell in love with a narcissistic scum bag.
I like Jaidyn shes actually super chill with a nice vibe.
Jaidyn is soo calm and fun. Knows how to hold a conversation.
I'm just glad she's doing a interview by herself for once 😂
I just love Jaidyn, she’s so chill ❤ I’d definitely love to see her with her own line of shades too
This is one of the most genuine interviews he’s had.

The sounds effects are so satisfying!
There's something I've dreamed of seeing in blox since I started playing, collision between attacks. Being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible, using the ice X to stop attacks for example. This would definitely change the blox combat style, as well as making it more complex and, in my opinion, interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful.
I personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island I think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled ""Tree Top"".
the Z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender, X move is lookin like the best combo starter, fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer, F is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage, (Base)

(Mode)
riding is ultimate furry (half joking lol)
Z move looks alot better, fits the transformation
X move is honestly worse than non mode X, range is way to short and can only be used as an extender, but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
C move is practically the same, just more aoe and (probably) damage
F move is just a slightly better version of itself, not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

Opinion: Is leopard better? yes and no, leopard is more spammy than kitsune, but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo, honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

Bonus: Fox lamp
Z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it, 
X (tap) good extender with seemingly good damage
X(hold) imo worse than tap X but better for aoe

Is it better than the best sword aka Cdk? No, it has potential but cdk has more combo potential (and most likely more damage)

I wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol
TIMESTAMPS 😀(Please pin this as it helps many people)

Value higher than Leo(as showed on twitter)

Both moves can be held for more damage
The devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
I wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless. I do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
Most visually pleasing fruit imo. Hope for more much better updates to come. Been playing this quite a while and although I hate grind games, this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games I've ever played.
Moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations. I am looking forward to using this fruit in the future!
This seems to be a good anti-teamer fruit. Flashy, incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others. Plus I see amazing combo potential with Kitsune and Fox Lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
I started playing Blox fruits a while back and Blox Fruits has really stepped up their game. They have recently come out with Update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new Max level- this new Max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play. They also definetly know what they are doing. They always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often. This update 20 came out somewhat around the time of One Piece Live Action which means that when players watch One Piece Live Action they might understand more about Blox Fruits and want to play. Well done Blox fruits :)
I think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon. I hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion.
I love this fruit and all the mechanics, the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers. Can't wait for the Dragon And Control Rework!!

It would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragon's moves just to see if they are worth buying

*Let's just appreciate how much a lot of time Gamer Robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day, huge respect!* 😆 👍
When transforming like a fox, maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler!😊
Maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work!😄😄
I think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run / skycamp with tbh
the other mythical needs to keep up with the kitsune fruit which means every mythic needs a buff and others rework",20,Gaming,2870000,PT11M26S

http://share.epidemicsound.com/pHDFT",5831,"I’ve never seen someone buy so many items at a Japanese electronic store. You must have broken a record 😂
Thanks for having me along for the day man, was a lot of fun!
Hope you’ve got some snacks ready - this is the longest video we’ve EVER made 😂 Which country’s tech do you want us to test next?
Looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in Japan! Next time round, how about scoping out some everyday gizmos. Would love to see how Japan's home-tech game stacks up against ours.
your one of my favorite YouTubers Arun. you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
Fun Fact, there was actually another company in Japan called ""Logitec"" (it's spelled the same as Logitech in Japanese), and they were in Japan before Logitech was able to open up anything in Japan, so they had to change their name to Logicool in Japan only to avoid a name conflict.
This is so surreal. I've been letting the Abroad in Japan channel build up videos to binge, and after the Frozen Frontier series, I went back to another video from Arun to finish it, and I was like ""Oh yeah! There's a new video, I wanna watch that!"" And now seeing Chris walk in was like...

The only way I can express the feeling was imagine you watch a TV show, and then switch to another TV show, only to see the character from the other TV show nonchalantly walk in. Like, what?
That trackball mouse is something I used at my job back in the late 80s, early 90s. You’ve never seen one before?! 
This was a great collab!  Love to watch both yours and Chris’s channels. 
That store completely blows my mind. I could be in there for days…
Love the longer video, btw. This was enjoyable to watch.
I might be one of the few Japanese subscribers of your channel. Your videos are awesome and I genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them (maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho). Hope you’ll come back soon🇯🇵🙌
I think I can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food, genuinely amazing.
the timing of those memes is just *chef's kiss*
I love how excited Arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol.
The ball mouse is called a trackball, pretty useful especially helping reduce RSI. its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it. Also for fine control, you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate.
39:20 first time in Japan (over twenty years ago) taught me that rice is not a ""bulk up"" / ""filler""  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate, even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion - it's a hard sell to a lot of Westerners   
but  it's my occasional, once or twice a year, life mission.
I’m a Japanese in the UK and I really enjoyed this.  Shame the kids watch won’t work in the UK. With child safety more of an issue here than in Japan it would probably do relatively well here.  I love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years.  Yum Asia do good ones in the UK and not as expensive as the Japanese leader but similar technology. I didn’t see it in the video, and I know it’s not a cooking channel… but I hope you washed the rice first…. 😅
It’s my dream to go to Japan, definitely visiting this tech place when I eventually go 🥰
Touch Ball Mice are used a lot in North America (Canada more then USA) they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as AutoCAD Maya, Blender and image creation such as Krita, Photoshop etc. They work very well for a lot of things even gaming. I loved mine but the ball has a small accident, exactly like the one you had when you picked it up, My sister and I nicked named the ball  ""BOOOTS"" its a joke from Baldur's Gate 2 with the Gigantic Minatare Space Hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling ""NO BOOTS!"" as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over, its done and now you are sad. I would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice, with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion, when it fits right, you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life. So you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how ""BOOTS"" died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident. After that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality. 
Final thing there are some that use 2-4 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3D environment such as 123D, AutoCAD and others, but it also makes games such as MMORPGs, FPS and RTS a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots, especially the multiple sensor ones.

So find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the DPI you want and never look back, that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that, a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments.
I love coverage like this. I'd love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device. For example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s (a portable record player was one of my first repairs). I'd be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then. I suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts, or vinyl enthusiasts, but instead retirees, whose entire music collection is in vinyl, and are just happy to still be able to play what they have.

I felt this way about a few of the items in this video, and some recent videos. I think it's especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices.

Other than that, you've done an amazing job, as always. And I can't wait to see the next one.
Thank you so much for giving us so much quality content and being so interesting❤ you look like you had a fun time🎉
This is a dream collab! For a long time I watched you guys' channels and appreciated you in every video, but seeing you conquer the biggest electronic store together is such a nice surprise. Japan lifestyle carries both futuristic prospects and the relics of the past, so any kind of video from there is bound to be the most interesting tech and lifestyle content.
Arun consistently amazes me with the incredible dedication and effort he puts into his videos. His passion for technology shines through in every frame, and it's truly commendable. The buying and reviewing tech series is, without a doubt, the best out there – his thorough insights, engaging delivery, and genuine excitement for the latest gadgets make each video an absolute delight to watch. Keep up the fantastic work, Arun, your hard work does not go unnoticed, and your content continues to be a beacon for tech enthusiasts like myself!",28,Science & Technology,17300000,PT40M10S

Dwight McNeil such a baller to be honest
Everton with all their work-rate, determination and belief fully deserved to win! 🤗
So happy for Dobbin, well done young man. 👏
Молодцы , Эвертон , с победой !
I'm a wolves supporter but always like to see you boys do well. Glad you have bounced back after the point deduction. All the best for the rest of the season 👍
How good is it to see our players just hitting the ball with confidence into the back of the net.
Mykolenko is awesome beast !!! Real professional model ..❤
Dobbin what a moment for the young man hope there's more to come
This is the Everton I always know. The team that is extremely tough to play against. Good game. 😂😂
So pleased for Sean Dyche and his players. Another fantastic result, fully deserved. Really starting to gel as a team now. All confidence at this level.
Everton were on the verge of relegation in 2021, 2022. They always found a way to survive. This season is much harder, as they were playing well until 10 point deduction again put them in relegation battle but they still don't give up. Surely despite the difficulties, they will fight and stay in Premier League as they have been great despite the deduction. Credits goes to Sean Dyche too for keeping Everton team spirits high.
As a manchester United fan im happy Everton is back in form and not looking like they r going to slow down
Didn’t ever look like conceding, stayed in the game and took two chances when they came along. You’ll never beat the toffees 🔵⚪️
Doucoure is a Dyche masterclass. All those years he was too deep until Dyche moved him up now he scores every week. Always at right place at the right time.😅👏
Although not an Everton fan but still feel justice for them for winning 3 games in a row!! Feel they were harsh for being deducted 10 points ....but they already taken 9 points from e last 3 games!! Really salute them n Sean Dyche!!!
Such a massive win.
Your club is impressive and I'm glad for Pickford aswell. 
The best goalkeeper in the league, loyal to his club deserve to stay in Pl with his team.
Another great victory! Sean Dyche is getting us fighting for 90+ minutes and playing some decent attacking football to boot!
It feels good to be a Toffee again, even with a disproportionate 10-points deduction! Keep it going!

And the rope/line twisting more and more tightly around his neck, cutting off his air.... He didn't have much time left, thank you for saving him!🙏❤
Oh my goodness, how on earth did that poor little seal drag that bucket around? That rope was so tight around its neck, you could see it expand when you cut it. Well done, guys, I don't know how much longer that baby seal could have survived. Another great rescue, a really good job.👍👍
Thank you all! Such lucky, happy little pups. That bucket was one of the deadliest I've seen you do! Great team work.
The little one dragging the bucket was so relieved and definitely seemed to understand he needed help and excepted it graciously.

#1 seal didn't have much time left, and what a horrible mess it had to deal with. #2 was another one of those ball lines that also would have lead to it's demise the way it was wrapped around the body. Thank you OCN for saving these babies, and talking to them in a way to help calm them down is always so cute! 
As someone with asthma, I know what the seals feel when they are able to breathe freely 😢😅😊 Thank you for y’all’s unswerving efforts to helping seals and other wildlife. Have a wonderful and safe, healthy holiday season 😊❤
Thank you for the work you do.  Its interesting and helps to inform the public what these animals go through just to survive.
Watched Seaspiracy last night--heartbreaking! Thank you all for helping fix this mess we've made of the oceans
THANK YOU to the entire OCN Team for everything you do to release the seals from those dangerous entanglements!
Well done. Two more little lives saved. ❤
The things those little guys pickup . Its a miracle they make it out of the water. Strong to be pulling a bucket around. Thank you for saving them.❤
I’ve been watching these heroes of the sea life for years and keep wondering when they will give up on the endless need for saving seals from ghost gear entanglements. But they persist, with skill and empathy week after week, year after year. So grateful

Et dans les mangas, y en a eu d’autres des moments, ceux  qui te font dire “putain la vie c’est de la merde”, et c'est ce qu'on va voir ensemble aujourd'hui.

Super vidéo ! Seulement, pour moi, la mort la plus triste de One Piece est la mort du Merry. La mort d'Hiriluluc est une masterclasse, comme celle de Rossinante ... Mais le Merry, c'est un torrent de larmes, genre c'est pas possible les émotions ressenties durant ce passage.
Merci encore Trash pour cette vidéo !
La dernière mort m'a fait lâcher ma larme et ça m'a rappelé quand je l'avais vu
Elle m'a tellement marquée cette mort que même entendre l'OST de ce passage me fait pleurer 

Super vidéo et hâte pour la prochaine
J'ai pleuré pour absolument toutes celles de JoJo .... Elles sont toutes belles, tristes et bien amenées et mises en scène

Une mort qui m'a beaucoup marqué c'est celle de Mikki dans Devilman Crybaby. Sa mort est deja horrible en soit mais c'est tout ce qui gravite autour qui rend ça marquant( la déchéance de l'humanité, la défaite d'Akira etc.)
La mort de Koro-Sensei qui me fait toujours autant pleurer, la musique, la scène, le dernier appel... C'était tellement beau
beaucoup de larmes ont été versées 💪
Quand j'ai vu le titre ""La mort la plus triste de Jojo"" j'ai mis pause et j'ai hésité à skip la partie tellement ça ravivait des souvenirs douloureux en moi 😭
Toutes ces morts sont horrible et traumatisante quand ont s'attache aux personnages. Pour ma part la mort de Meruem à la fin de l'arc Kimera Ant de Hunter Hunter, reste charger en émotion, tristesse, amour, fidélité. Une des morts les plus émouvante à mon sens.
La mort qui m'a fait pleurer quand j'avais 8 ans c'etait celle de Jiraya, sah j'ai mis du temps à m'en remettre 😂
Personne parle de jojo donc je vais commencer, mais il faut dire que la mort de narancia et celle de Gyro sont définitivement les plus tristes. La scène de fin de sbr est si touchante, le regard dans le ciel et le souvenir de ses avantures est tellement émouvant. 
Coeur sur vous❤
La mort de rengoku m’a marqué , surtout parce que j’y ai trouvé des similitudes à la mort de Ace ( un personnage qui manie les flammes qui se fait tuer par un trou dans le ventre ) et  surtout parce que je pensais des personnages aussi fort physiquement et mentalement que rengoku ne pouvait juste pas mourrir, c’est pour ça que sa mort m’a marqué 😢 mais franchement , super vidéo Chauve 👌
La mort de Rengoku... J'ai vu le film 5 fois, j'ai pleurer les 5 fois. Tellement de frisson !
Rengoku quand il a vu ça mère ... il est mort apaisé on l'oubliera jamais ! Kokoro moyase ! 🔥
La mise en scène dans la mort de César est juste incroyable 
J’aime bien aussi la mort de Thérèse dans Claymore
Bon, ben j'ai relâché une larme pour Koro-sensei

Cette scène est tellement incroyable 😭
J'ai tellement pleurer pendant le visionnage de cette vidéo merci de m'avoir fait redécouvrir les morts les plus iconiques du manga.
Merci de faire des vidéos d'aussi bonne qualité.
Excellente vidéo comme à votre habitude. Ça ne me dérange pas d’habitude mais dans cette vidéo les placement de produit m’en vraiment sorti de la vidéo surtout pour ce genre de sujet celui de fin était vraiment brutal je trouve et idem le premier. Merci quand même pour la vidéo qui a fait remonter beaucoup d’émotion et de souvenir ❤",1,Film & Animation,575000,PT15M22S
CA,YerFRnGDBYE,No bank loaned them money. They built dream Hobbit Home themselves,Kirsten Dirksen,2023-12-10T15:19:25Z,"underground home,earth-sheltered home,underground dome home,hobbit home,hobbit villa,earth-sheltered dome home,dome kit home,extreme weather home,personal building odyssey,natural cooling,bioclimatic home,self-financed home,earthquake-proof home,hurricane-proof home,hyper-insulated home,mortgage-free home,steve travis,jeff ingram,newport,oregon",100189,4585,"When no bank would give them a loan for a sunken dome home, Steve Travis and Jeff Ingram began to build the earth-sheltered hobbit villa on their own, financing each step paycheck to paycheck and getting creative. They used recycled highway signs to lay the forms for the concrete foundation. 

They held a ""dome-raising"" party to erect the I-Beams (purchased as a dome kit). They tied their own rebar for a full year. They lived in a fifth-wheel trailer for 6 years before finally moving into a half-built house.

Their commitment paid off. Today, the couple has spent a decade living mortgage-free in a home that is built to ""withstand a nuclear blast,"" as well as hurricanes and earthquakes (they are in a fault zone). They have no heating or cooling bills since the home is hyper-insulated. “There are 1000 tons of earth on top of the house,” explains Steve. “The weight adds strength to the structure – like an egg, because of the barrel-hauled structure the weight of the earth compresses it and makes it stronger –, but the main aspect is the thermal mass insulation value.” Per code, the county made them put in two bedroom wall heaters, but they have never needed them. 

The home is maintenance-free except for having to mow the roof, which now bathes the entire home in green. “We've had people say it must be like living in a cave, but there's light everywhere in this house.” 

Because the walls aren’t load-bearing (the barrel vaults hold the home in compression), they were able to create huge windows on three sides of the home, allowing in plenty of southern light: “more than any home we’ve ever lived in.”

This home is not only cozy and has gorgeous views, it saves money and is built like a tank -- a true shelter from the elements.
Amazing. I've watched your channel Kirsten for years and years. Always impressed by so many homes & structures you've featured. This one is up there in my top ten fave's of your visits to spectacular homes. I love the ceiling -  like an unpainted Sistine Chapel or the Mihrab dome in the Great Mosque of Córdoba Spain. It's my dream to build something like this.
My husband and I did the same kind of thing. we had a 4,000 sq ft round house that took us 12 years.  he passed not long after and I moved. that was 18 years ago now.
This house and the way they built is very inspirational. I love this
What a creative design and commitment! Views are stunning. I actually considered building something similar but chickened out when I read articles about water issues. Plus, the topography of my land really only allowed for windows on one side of the house. What I love the most about your home are the  large windows on multiple sides. I ended up building a gray shake shingle traditional home with white trim and window boxes (I must mention I have a blush pink front door). I built the home with tons of windows and views of rolling hills and a forest. I watch the sunsets from my screened porch every night. It makes me feel very connected with nature. I purchased the land 25 years ago and built about one year ago and I'm in love with the property. Really enjoyed the tour of your home and I completely understand your  labor of love.
I can’t believe I am watching my friends Steve and Jeff’s house, it is a wonderful house story.  Thanks so much.
I love this home in ways that might take forever to describe.....It has so much of all the ways I have wanted to build a home since I discovered Earth based homes in 1979.....
I live in this area........love this so much!! I have been in an underground house here in Oregon and what I loved about it was how quiet it was. Those views are to die for!
I agree, more homes should be built this way!  Nice Job Steve n Jeff 🙂
Thank to the authors and the owners of the house for such an interesting project. So happy for people that don’t accept established rules and do what they want and feel. I personally always felt that common “square box” paradigm of construction are such a mistake that was made once long time ago and continuing now. Squares and triangles are just unnatural, almost nowhere in the nature we can find such forms, but we still use them while building structures where we spend most of our time.
WOW! What an amazing home! The whole home is a artistic work in progress. What a beautiful place to live.❤
That concrete bench top 😍😍😍
Such a beautiful home! Thank you for showing us this masterpiece 🩷
Absolutely!!!  I'm in the process of placing wheels under everything I can - not to facilitate dance parties, but, those of us who are older want to be able to easily move furniture so we can more easily clean!  Whatever anyone's reason is, it just seems more logical!  Although, I suppose most people would think it strange! 

I also lived in a house with a lot of sunlight coming in, too. But living in the Northern Hemisphere the sunlight only reached into ~ 4' - ~ 4.5' into the house - just as this house in the video does, depending on the time of year.  I can't afford to build and live in my own house now, but I often wondered about living in a narrow house, where the darkness is ""cut off"" and the sunlight reaches more into the interior of the house, but, of course, you sacrifice space.  However, no worries - there is the mass of the house, which captures the heat - a couple of ways to heat - sunlight and/ or mass of the structure. 

The interior is beautiful,  with the curved surfaces; and the out side of the house is covered green, which is interesting.  But - another sacrifice is that with a right angled home, you have surfaces you can paint, although far more expensive.  I'm thinking about the black exteriors of homes in the Faroe Islands, places in Norway - and the beautiful, glossy dark green or black paint on the homes in the island in the Netherlands  - Marken. Also, the beautiful whites and blues (Greece and Spain [tiles, too]), or the exterior colors on the buildings in parts of Europe... This family has chosen a different path!

(Oh, yes, as others have mentioned - gorgeous views❤)
I think this is the most amazing home you have ever presented to us. I live not to far away in Western Lane County and wish my circumstances would allow me to build something similar. Thank you for show showing this.
I drove past this house all the time when I was younger and as a local I’ve always been curious about it, so cool to see it in more depth and come full circle on a channel I greatly enjoy. Keep up the great work!
Always a treat to watch these videos I wonder how you find unique projects like this only thing is your pacing or runtime i know you have your own ways of storytelling but i am  sure you could do even more than this in storytelling by-the way video production and all are top notch
I absolutely love everything about this home!! It’s an ingenious and beautiful design!! ❤❤❤
Cheers
Creative and thoughtful design that makes a lot of sense.  I wish we had more homes like this.
What a wonderful project! Congratulations and thank you for sharing! Very inspiring!",26,Howto & Style,1880000,PT32M49S

Danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
For me, Barbie in the Nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation.
I would just like to point out that Danny’s little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker. It’s a toy soldier.

I could not take it with the dad’s reaction to the pebble I was laughing so hard. The blank stare, the trembling hands. The concerned look from his wife. Like what could this rock have possibly done to you?? Why do they never talk about it again??
I love how what started as a quirky and unconventional Nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left Danny with more questions than answers about the original tale.
Fun fact: This movie was funded by literal Russian state and was the most expensive Russian movie to date.
Ill be honest, as a ballerina, just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was _hysterical_
I would GLADLY watch you review ballets! Swan Lake has like 4 different endings, i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives.
As a ballerina, watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious. Especially when you referred to Fritz as ""this little freak"".
That end bit scared me so bad. I actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat. Seeing Danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing I've witnessed in a while
It's nice to see Danny hasn't lost his Christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen.
Can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with Danny's toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass.
I laughed so hard I fell off my bed when he said ""He misses his pebble.""
I'm honestly surprised that Danny didn't make the connection that Love on a Leash ALSO had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form. Now I just wanna know if there's any more movies with characters like that
What a stunning cast... Baby Elle Fanning, Snowbell from Stuart Little, and Moaning Myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of The Nutcracker the world's ever seen...
Hiring Albert Einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex I've ever seen.
Thank you for watching the ballet Danny! Sincerely, every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the Nutcracker
My little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago. I rented this for her hoping she'd love it. I feel so bad 😥🤕
In all the versions of the nutcracker I've seen, Drosselmeyer has a clown/assistant guy with him not a child. I've always loved the energy of just showing up to a family event with your clown friend who doesn't break character the entire time.",23,Comedy,6360000,PT28M49S

But what happens when an unknown variable gets inserted into that plan.  How do you deal with it.  What actions can you take. The pilots of this flight are in that very but as we will soon see, unknown variables can have extreme outcomes if not treated with due care and diligance. Stay tuned...

Unlike most of your covered incidents, this seemed much less a Swiss cheese model and much more a tragic plethora of challenges and confusion happening all at once. So sad, since the crew had been so professional and cautious.
I've been an airline captain for 37 consecutive years. Have in excess of 27,000 hrs PIC, on 777, 767, 737, A320, 727 and ATR. 
I'm still learning, been lucky on my career so far, without any serious trouble to date.
I must say this channel's content is the most precious ever, it's a valuable learning tool. 
My sincere compliments to Mentour Pilot!
I live in Rostov-on-Don and this tragedy really shocked all of us. And unfortunately someone I know were affected and lost the members of their families. I’ve read a lot of investigations and different articles about this catastrophe, but only here and now I really understood what happened. Thank you for this video and explanation. And may all the crash victims rest in peace 🙏
I’m an air traffic controller and we use your videos extensively during ECT, not only to provide better assistance during time of need, but also to learn valuable lessons that could potentially help us in the future. Never too old or experienced to learn and your videos serve as excellent library of information. Thank you for the amazing content!
The copilot was a friend of my brother and I from years before the tragedy. We knew him quite well from those years. He was smart, and thorough. I investigated all that I could of how and what happened, and I saw he tried to save this situation as much as possible, but the captain was tremendously confused and deep in tunnel vision to back off his decisions and start trusting instruments in time. Very very sad. RIP Alex
I’ve been a pilot for 17 years here in Germany. Not only is this channel informative, it also serves as a valuable learning tool for pilots all across the globe. The simulator is a fantastic learning device, but most accidents I feel can be attributed to overload stress and crew resource management. Basic communication between crew members is absolutely essential. If something is wrong, mention it. And a good Captain uses his resources and listens. Inexperience does not always equal a wrong answer. 

Thank you for your videos. They are second to none and a vital resource for any current or future pilot! You may be saving future lives with your informative videos!
I remember watching your videos when you were on the sofa with the notes and the dogs. There was nothing wrong with that and I still love your old video, but it's so amazing to see how you've grown the channel into making TV quality documentaries at this point. You're an inspiration Petter!
I can only imagine how fast the final 59 seconds must have occurred in that cockpit. Also, to be in the back of the plane at that time of morning, after waiting and waiting and waiting, the horror that some of the alert passengers must have realized was about to happen. I can only pray that the impact was so sudden, so severe and so instant that nobody had any chance to feel that for even a second. Wonderful job here, as always, describing the events as true to life as possibly. Thank you!

I was not really prepared for this to end in such a tragic crash. It seemed like such a simple issue, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. This is one of the accidents that are so sad because it seemed so preventable. My condolences to all who lost their loved ones.
As a frequent flyer, i treasure these insights into how safe aviation travel is.  Flying is complicated, and yet flying is still the safest mode of transportation.  Channels like yours showcase what can go wrong, but highlight what prevents these accidents from happening in the first place.
Great job Petter, describing a sad accident that simply should NOT have happened.
(I’m a retired 30k hour captain, with lots of time on both the 737-800 with it’s fabulous HUD, and other Boeings up to and including the 747-400.)
It was a really sad, very disturbing story, showing how absolutely critical it is to stay ahead of the aeroplane. 
I wonder why he was so loathe to use Autopilot in such conditions.
The quality of the explanation at 33:16 (behind/ahead of the aircraft) is just insane. Thank you Mentour for letting us enjoy your lectures.
My friend live in a building bordering the airport. 
When plane smashed into the ground, the whole building was shaken, and few windows got broken. 
Some small fragments of the aircraft were scattered across his and some nearby buildings' roofs. 

That should give you a rough idea of the forces involved.
As a young engineer that only just started her career in aviation, I must thank you and your team for your hard work explaining each and every incident. You cannot imagine how your content not only helps pilots but also other people who work in aviation.
Thanks to your content, I’ve understood things more in depth and it brought a new meaning to my job as an aeronautics engineer and how much every detail can make a change.

Keep up the good work! ❤
The Fltcrew were well trained, and performed well until the 2nd approach. This terrible accident brings many things into question, including if we're reaching the limits of the man/machine interface as it currently exist. 
Pieter, your content and presentation is absolutely amazing. 
I felt this one in my bones.
RIP to all aboard.
These episodes now blow any sort of Nat Geo type air incident documentaries, with all their overly dramatic 'entertainment' elements out of the water.
Massive thanks to you Petter, and all of your superb team - so well explained, presented and executed.
Patreon membership here I come 👍🙂
Albert Einstein said, if you can’t explain it to a six year old you don’t understand it yourself. I am not 6 years old but when it comes to aviation I may as well be. After watching your videos I can give a reasonable explanation as to what happened in the event you reviewed. Proud to be part of you patron crew. Keep the videos coming.
Oh wow... throughout almost the entire video, right up until you told us that the GPWS warnings were too late, I had been thinking that this was going to be one of those ""near miss"" incidents, where they went through some terrifying loss of control, but were able to pull through in the end.  I hadn't ever heard of this accident before, and figured that if it had ended in a fatal crash, I'd have known about it already.  That ending was such a gut punch.  Just shows how quickly things can change in the cockpit.",24,Entertainment,1690000,PT51M33S

That's why I love police bodycam vodeos so much, the stupid ridiculous things people think they can do or say to get out of jail is hilarious. And I'm so jealous you and your wife essentially got free front row seats to a live show. Beats Joker in theaters any day.

This man is lucky to have a beautiful wife who loves him along with kids who love him too. Can we appreciate this man is putting so much effort into making these vids and telling his stories to us? I sure do.
This guy has stories after his childhood that does not have Michael. What a guy. Keep it up 👍

It’s about time I always need more Brew stew in my life
who needs the joker when you have a drunk guy getting a dui right? great video brewstew 😂
few hours ago a tornado blew through my neighborhood and many other places around me. it  didn’t hurt me but it hurt many of my friends and neighbors. seeing a new video from you is like being told it will be better. thanks for just being you man
The callbacks are so perfect in this one, Id take an hour of brewstew over a movie any day!
The callbacks are so perfect in this one
Tyler, just wanted to say a massive thank you for your uploads over the years. Seen them all as they release, but the last few days I have been severely ill and I’ve been binge watching your videos to pass times and to focus on something, all while laughing through it. So thank you! Keep doing what you’re doing!
this is why Brewstew is the best. he always puts out the best content and he doesn’t change to be like someone else. i never laugh as hard as i do with a different channel
This guy has stories after his childhood that does not have Michael. What a guy. Keep it up
ive binged watch every single one of your videos at least 4 times. the stories never get old!

The masked enemy is going to be absolute chaos with the larger lobby mod with giant groups of them on the map.
The horror/comedy combo of the masked in the ship repeatedly walking over the Whoopie cushion 😂😂
No intro, straight to business. Perfection.
Masked: A creepy figure which takes over the body of the individual it possesses like a parasite, forcing them to turn against their teammates to spread the mask

Nutcracker: lmao shotgun
It would be fun if the mask gives you some incredible power (temporarily see monsters through walls, temporarily see loot through walls, etc), but with an increasing chance of becoming ""possessed"" with each use.
The Masked is actually a great way to implement the mimic idea. They didnt lean too much into the horror and too much into the comedy and fits the game perfectly.
Hey Wurps, I know you probably won't see this but I really wanna state how helpful each video of yours has been. All are very informative and I've learned more tricks than I can count with your help. Keep making more!
The spray can is very useful. I remember an old indie game called ""erie"" had it as a mechanic to remind yourself where the exit at
I love the asthmatic of comedy/tragedy masks, so when I saw that they added them, I was ecstatic.

I check the shop, hoping to see the mask as a cosmetic for that day. Instead I leave with the pajama man. I now worship the pajama man, but that’s besides the point.

As I enter titan, I stumble across a storage type room about 3 rooms from the door. On one of the shelves I find a fancy mask. “Darn, it’s a scrap, not a cosmetic. I wonder if I can wear it?” 

To my glee, you can left click to hold the mask to your face. “I should scare someone when they enter” I though.

Twice more I put on the mask, but right before someone enters, I suddenly cannot remove the mask, and everything turns red. All they hear is my anguished cries before I go silent. I proceeded to kill my entire team, resulting in us losing the quota worth of scrap and one day to make it up.

This game is awful. 10/10 would do again.
One big thing to note about the masked enemies is that they will follow you outside the facility.
someone should make a decoy that looks like a player/scarecrow, that can be places to hold the coil head in space by looking at it
My friends and I discovered the masks organically. We brought a mask back to the ship as well as a crewmates body. When the mask makes contact with a corpse it automatically takes it over. We were very confused as to why our friend’s body just got up and started walking.
7:02 max speed is slightly less & you get the fear effect whenever it spots you
I love that players that have been bodyjacked by a shyguy still keep their friendly marker on the ship radar, so unaware cams players can try to 'rescue' them with the teleporter.
My god. I was just thinking that I wanted an enemy that hijacks your body. This dev knows what’s fun. 
I hope that masked teamates still appear friendly on the radar. I want mind games
Important thing about the mask: it can possess corpses. Always be wary of abandoning a corpse in Rend, you might see it walk out of the front door.
I find it funny how the aracnophobia mode was added because just yesterday I was teaching a young cousin about the game and he was handling the game pretty well, very scared all this considered, but when it got to the spiders he got absolutely terrified when he was walking back trying to find the way out and found spider webs, and I told him that was the bunker spider, and he asked me to pick the keyboard and play just for that bit so he could go back to the ship and continue playing after. I'd say the aracnophobia option will help him greatly lmao
I absolutely love love love that the power of the signal transmitter to keep the run alive is matched by it also just being another source of dread and terror.
 Imagine you are in the facility alone in the dark surrounded by monsters and you just see ""R U N"" or ""G O O D B Y E"" fill your entire vision.
 That is such a disheartening way to send bad news, it's perfect!
What makes the Masked so terrifying is that, you dont even need a living person to be taken over, the Mask can also possess dead bodies lying on the floor.",20,Gaming,14900,PT8M14S

#miamaples #dior #expensive",4430,"the fact that the dior advent calendar is more expensive than buying everything individually at retail price👀
PETITION FOR MIA TO TURN THE DIOR BOX INTO A DOLL HOUSE!!!!
I love that Dior is so aware that their $5,400 is ridiculous that they actually pay someone to call you up and ask ""Are you sure?"" 💀
The Disney Swarovski set was underwhelming given how many characters Disney owns
Charlotte tillbury one was the only one that's worth it. it provided all the basics that you need for makeup(besides foundation and concealer and stuff that you need to pick individually for your skin complexion) so if someone wants to get into Charlotte tillbury or just high end makeup, this will be a perfect thing to buy. props to them!!!
Only Mama Maples can make the best out of the worst situation of being scammed but a luxury company.
In my limited experience, the more expensive the calendar, the higher the disappointment. Can't go wrong with a cheap one, it's only up from there! ♥
I got progressively angrier at Dior the farther we went. Even if they did retail that much, they’re a scam. And they don’t even retail. It’s disgusting.
I'm a retired nurse , and in my life would never be able to afford  to indulge in even one of these products  Saying that,  I really enjoyed seeing you and your mom unbox these calendars.  Thank you for the opportunity to experience this with you.. This is the first video I''ve watched of yours and subscribed immediately!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!😍
Has Mama Maples EVER not been a ray of absolute sunshine?   I cannot imagine her mad,
I don't know, maybe the cost was making you guys giddy, but I CACKLED so hard during the Dior unboxing! Thanks for the laugh! ❤
Am I the only one hearing that they are saying SwarVoski? And she also spelled it that way on the ""screen"" where she announces the different advent calendars. I think that's so funny 😅 love the energy
Also the fact that Mama Maples tries to educate Mia on all the Disney characters is sooo funny 😂
Watching Mia's advent calendar videos is now one of my Christmas traditions lol, I get stunned by the prices every year.
Mia, I'm sorry that Dior is so extra. However, these are the MOST fun videos! I look forward to them every year! I love momma Maples reactions. She's so priceless! Thank you!!
19:13 the moment Mia goes to stop Mama Maples from trying the lipstick 😂 she is so cute!
Both of those went totally in a different direction than I expected! I thought Disney would be a new character every box, and I have no idea why Dior I assumed makeup. This was a wild ride 😂
I love when your Mom gets excited about opening the boxes. The ""wows"" all made me laugh.
I love how her mom is excited for everything 😂🧡

The jesse no scope was INSANE. I would like the no gun challenge
I think a classic kill race should be in order.

Unreal with no weapons would be hilarious
Jesses no scope head shot was crazy🔥
No gun challenge, maybe through in a skybase? What ever it is, Im sure you and Jesse can do it😎
Unreal with no weapons would be an insane video idea
There's no chance they got through 3 ranks per game in those early games.

epic fortnite chapter 5 season OG moments 

USE CODE CREAMY IN THE FORTNITE ITEM SHOP",1569,"If they update regularly this game is gunna be nuts.
I like the new Fortnite Lego game mode it’s something new and fresh.
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest. It's way better than we all expected
One can only imagine how they're going to continue developing the mode, it has so much potential, i cant wait to see where we go from here, personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
Also, I found out, if you’re behind a bush while killing the boss dude, he won’t attack you, he gets confused. Also, another glitch, if you put down a new chest and put your swords, farming tools, etc in it, and punch it to break it, it heals your weapons and farming tools (note this will be patched asap I’m sure). But it works for now!
I hope you enjoyed the new mode, it's been a ton of fun for me and the boys :)
I think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby. As a person who experienced that myself, today was my first time playing Chapter 5. I absolutely loved Battle Royale but I clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in LEGO
I had some experience with Motion Capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall. Kudos to the devs. It's a funny detail you wouldn't neccessary expect in a game like this one. Ps. You almost saw me as Leon in these new Resident Evil games :)
So far, this mode is pretty similar to minecraft, if they update regularly, this can become an original masterpiece.
Keep it up Creamy! The new mode is really fun tho.🔥
You know it’s a good day when McCreamy uploads
I've been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff, but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative!! I'm so excited for this game mode. There's so many possibilities!
McCreamy is a legend. Bro makes a boring day into a good one, love this guy. ❤
I think that this is the best day that they’ve had in a while. Amazing job Fortnite! 🎉❤
McCreamy never fails to make good content 😅 😱
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 💖💖💖
I love how he steps out of his way just to entertain us
you can tell this mode is gonna be succesfull and i trust epic games in keeping it updated and interesting
The fact that McCreamy does this for OUR entertainment is just gold. We all love you McCreamy! 😅 😅",20,Gaming,10500000,PT19M40S

If that doesn't work, then continue doing what you're doing
One thing I like about the prefab builds is they're modular; You can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with Shack Doors to create passible outbuildings.
Biggest building issue I've had is there doesn't seem to be a way to change the elevation of your non-prefab Foundations, making it hard to keep things at the same level.
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue, it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
You can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches , yes it costs more wood however it’ll light up the cave for you so it’s easier to find whatever your looking for
Before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating, not a tip
Don’t just throw away tools that you don’t use. Use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it. They can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation.
Really Fantastic Synopsis and Tips. You nailed it! I would add: 
-Build Your First Village at the Edge of a Desert Border AND Near a Knotwood cave, NOT where you spawn into the game. Make your life easier and everything more efficient!
-Build a Bed at the Mouth of a Cave as a Save Point. If you die, you respawn in your bed; you won't have to travel back to your quest point.
-Empty almost ALL of your Backpack before beginning a Quest. You'll need the inventory slots.
-Pack for a trip! MAX Wood Planks to build Repair Chests, Cooked Food, Snowberry Shakes or Cheesy Burgers
Its good to stack lumber mills, it makes crafting so much quicker
something I always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever I need to collect granite I take that villager and start going at some rocks. unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes, even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching, so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
If you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and it’ll destroy everything for you
Go on top of moutains that have large trees, cut them down, roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
I love to make a village stylish and neat, it is the most important thing! 😊
Man, this was one of the coolest surprises of the year.  I've always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome.  Who'd have thought it would be fortnite to do it
You’re lucky - the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and that’s with infinite stamina.  However, the cold biome is 2 steps away
Make glider , build staircases 11 high. Make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as I land I build another one so I can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol I even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so I know the direction they follow back to back , helps tons on the map
Stamina bar is important, when youre flying with a glider, it consumes your stamina while up in the air, by the time you run out, you will drop from fall damage and die.
I personally think temp don’t matter as much,but stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didn't go down, so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills, lumber mills, work benches, etc. then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
The way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me. That way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells. And the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S

Can't wait to see 20+mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
Shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh.
Really happy to see where smosh is currently.
I almost teared up when Anthony at the end says that Shayne has kept the true meaning of Smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera. It's so true and that's what makes Smosh so special. Especially the cast now. You can see how close everyone is with each other and from Ian and Anthony to Chance and Angela. (the newest cast members) Everyone just puts a big smile on my face!
come back next week for a new *Assumptions episode with OPENLY GAY PASTORS*
MEMBERS WATCH UNCENSORED & AD FREE▸ https://youtube.com/anthonypadilla/join
Man, at the beginning, when Anthony started listing all the eras Shayne went through, I got so sad. These people carried Smosh through it's darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old Smosh. Shayne, Courtney, Damien etc. truly are the unsung heroes of Smosh.
I’ll basically watch Shayne do anything for any amount of time.
I love this era of smosh. Smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter. We're now honoring Smosh for everything they've done. and seeing how they've become a giant family warms my heart. What a time to be alive.
Shayne’s depth as a human is what made me enjoy Smosh more… I remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is. As someone else who LOVES reading and thinks it, more than anything else, can develop a person, that was nice to see :) he’s genuine, intelligent, and over the top absurd. Love him!
Dearest Shayne, I can’t tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on Smosh this entire time. We don’t know what we would ever do without you. You are not only hilarious, but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member. I see how invested you are in other people. We all love you and please keep doing what you’re doing.
Ian and Anthony are the parents of Main but Pit and Games are Shayne’s babies. He really carried those channels for so long, my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic. Woo Shayne, Shayne it up!
I actually really like the idea of interviewing Smosh cast members.
Shayne is just such a pleasant person, he seems so fun and nice to be around. Love seeing Anthony and Shayne together again. The ""We Bought Smosh"" arc really is the best timeline.
The way Shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how I know he has the brain of an artist
Him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome ... deserves the world honestly
I’m glad that Shayne is getting some flowers. He’s clearly a comedy powerhouse, and very hardworking and loyal, but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person. I’m sure success will find him whatever he gets up to, but I’m glad it’s Smosh right now :)
I respect everything that Shane has done (as he is my favorite cast member), he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to Smosh & has helped kept it alive alongside Courtney & Ian.
Not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but I feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way.
I'm gonna be honest, the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of Shayne. I find him the MOST funny, comforting, relatable and inspiring personality on the internet. LOVE YOU SHAYNE
I don’t know if Shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry. Like… I remember that scene of the office when Jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives. And we can see all that with Shayne, Anthony, and the rest of the Smosh crew. They’re all incredible people and it’s awesome to see how far they have all grown.
The Chosen and Courtney Freaking Miller are two absolutely amazing characters, and I get so excited every time I see them on screen ❤",27,Education,7580000,PT31M26S

We refuse to split MTB content into a separate channel until one of you comes up with a SICK NAME BRO. FortNine-MTB? Too derivative. FortNine-Kids? Too offensive. We're accepting submissions below.

Also, we tried two types of rubber O-rings. There's a split ring and a solid ring. The former is easier to move around and the latter is less likely to fall off. You may get one or the other depending on how fast you are; please share your experience so we can choose the best option for the next folks. ~RF9
That's the kind of obsession over a close to non-existent problem I respect.
Honestly, I've always kept vehicle keys separate from the other keys. Give them a little keychain ornament so you know which is which in your pocket, and the motorcycle key gets something soft that won't ding anything around it.
Honesty and Integrity.  That's FortNine.  I haven't had a bike for years, but still watch the content anyway.  Plus, Ryan is one of Canada's national treasures.  Part of our Ryan Trifecta (with Reynolds and Gosling).
Heck yeah man! I have SO much respect for your decision to not only not sell crap, but to resist the too-easy choice of outsourcing to the lowest bidder in a horrible factory. Thank you.
This sounds like hyperbole, it’s not. Ryan, I am always amazed and impressed with your writing, directing, and filmmaking. Witty words and sneaky visual jokes in every video, just enough video to make your point yet also entertaining. I appreciate your work and integrity
Love that Ryan highlights how we buy unnecessary things! My motorcycle key is always on its own. I guess that's another way to solve the problem if you can
A very entertaining, informative video about an almost non-existent problem. 

And then a near apology for suggesting you could buy some of his merch. And an almost warning not to. 

And I listened to it twice while working in the garage because Ryan’s videos are that good.
I love that you guys showed your iterative process, whether they were bad or good. It is really nice to know that you guys thought out the concept and tested every possible scenario out first before finalizing the product and going to mass manufacture. Keep up the good work! I only have one motorcycle at the moment so I don't think I have a need for such an accessory but maybe one day I will and I'll be thinking of you guys.
So well made and honest advertisement with the viewer as equally valued human. I don't own a motorcycle, but am drawn to the charm and quality of this channel. ❤
bloody love the comedy Ryan can produce while still being more informative than most documentary's.
This channel is absolutely upper tier work and class. Love the F9 crew.
Glad to see someone other than myself recognized this problem. And you came up with a great design! (And I like your attitude, as always.) Keep up the great work, guys.
Rare to find a seller saying, 'Don't buy unless you really need it.' Refreshing honesty in a world of sales hype!
Nice design. Definitely solving a real problem. Looks good. Two small issues, potentially: (i) the metal stud might still scratch the trip clamp, unless you insert the key correct side up, which is the problem you're trying to solve and (ii) the fixed dimensions of the leather patch means no more than x number of keys can be accommodated, including possibly not the 6 or 8 keys you mentioned.
I was planning on typing up a novel on how your channel is the BEST in existence for motorcycle and ""other stuff"" content. You are a Legend and the content you provide is, and hopefully will remain Premo, otherwise it will blend with all the other junk out there. Kudos for not providing junk. keep up the great work, looking forward to more quality stuff.
As for the grommets, you can also wrap some or all of the keys in silicone rubber key caps, available at your local hardware store.
Bellroy key cover. Made exactly like your 3d printed version and works great. Ive used one for years now. Made of leather, uses magnetic enclosure and holds up to 8 keys. It is more costly though but I use it for my everyday keys. 

My motorcycles have always had their own dedicated soft key chains with their respective keys being the only ones attached to it.
Nice little invention!  Solving a nearly non-existent problem, love it!  After ""losing"" my stand-alone key by dropping it (finally finding it in the fork-guards after disassembling half the bike) I made a semi-braided paracord loop with plenty of knots to increase it's footprint, plus no rattling or scratches.  I can feel it with gloves on and in a pants pocket, and I used paracord with reflective fibers woven in so if I drop it in the dark a sweep with a flashlight or headlamp will hopefully reveal it quickly.  I have a mini carabiner on the waist adjuster of my jacket to hold it which I can get to without looking while I'm doing the helmet/glove dance.  These chipped keys are good and bad, and losing one is bad on all sorts of levels.",2,Autos & Vehicles,1850000,PT5M31S

What a good streak of victories, 13 points in 5 games, respect for this team🎉💪🏻
I can't imagine Bournemouth winning in old trafford, congratulations
Incredible performance from AFC Bournemouth ❤🎉
onana is the greatest signing united have done. the opponents love him and hope that united keep him for many years to come.
As a united fan, you all deserved this win, you actually played with grit and determination
Man U fan here, just stopping by to congratulate Bournemouth on a really well deserved victory. It really should have been 5-0, you had 2 perfectly good goals disallowed. We, however can have no complaints, we were simply outclassed by a superior club. Bournemouth were outstanding today and away at Old Trafford which makes it even sweeter of a victory. Well played <3
Fantastic win for Bournemouth 💪
Thank you solanke and Bournemouth. What a performance.
As a Liverpool fan, this tasted even sweeter than our comeback win against Palace. 😂
Well done, Cherries. A fully-deserved win and one for the history books! 👊
As a Liverpool fan I could not be any happier to see Solanke thriving. Man is being an absolute menace this season, best of luck to the Cherries!
As a Man United rival fan, ty Bournemouth. You did what had to bw done 🎉🎉
As a Liverpool fan, I also congratulate Bournemouth. A deserved victory for you right at Old Trafford and Man United probably just scored a hat-trick of best awards of the month so this match they lost 0-3 to show their gratitude to the fans. What a match
""Now down Solanke with a chance to run""
""And there are 75.000 boos and 1500 cheers""
MY ABSOLUTE FAV LINES!!!!!! LOVE IT
Proud to have a hungarian in such a resilient team, what a run of games for Bournemouth. I wish you all good luck for the whole season
NUFC fan here. You guys really have done great with our match last time, but this is even more awesome. Would love to see you guys going all the way to the top!
Well done lads, an absolutely spectacular performance! Thank you for such a great game and let's keep this going, up the Cherries! 🍒
As a forest fan, I’ve gotta say this made my day. Additionally, I think we did a good performance at wolves. Either way, that was a great performance from Bournemouth.
What a performance what a win from cherries👏👏👏unbelievable !!

 Congrats Bournemouth from Liverpool fan
Absolutely astonishing. Would never have predicted this. Well done Bournemouth!",17,Sports,146000,PT2M2S

Sorry for the confusion, i made the list for myself,added the games i interested with. Btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event, you can look for them
The orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of Oscar’s. The Flute Guy especially man, he absolutely nailed it.
I loved hearing the Alan Wake director speak on both occassions, he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching.
1:29:15 Loved Geoff Keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the Hello Kitty game! Best moment for me.
Let's all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there, what a legend
Congratulations Larian, you absolutely deserve all these awards and more!🎉😊
Congratulations to every other winner/nominee as well.

In all honesty BG3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo, but I'm happy TOTK, FF16, Alan Wake 2 and Hi-Fi Rush won some awards as well. Would have been perfect if Lies of P won best art direction.
Sami Järvi (a.k.a. Sam Lake) just IS Remedy Entertainment!!
This guy is living his job. 
Performing the choriography with Poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make.
Remedy pretty much never dissappoints.
Cheers!
Flute Guy is the pillar of The Game Awards that absolutely everyone can get behind. We may all like different games, but our celebration of Flute Guy is unanimous.
Huge congratulations to Neil Newbon and all the other Baldur's gate 3 makers. You have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves!!
A game dev that is so committed to his game that he goes to an awards show in a suit of FREAKING ARMOUR kinda deserves the win, huh. Keep making games, Larian!

Thanks to all of our Gold Level Patrons! Marisa Alfonso, Wendy Tran, Traci Lew, Matthew Tadros",2594,"Marissa and Zach have the energy of two siblings determined to ruin each other's days
The guys have come so far since the very first WAR episodes.

Proud to say I have survived another season.

Still one of my all time favorite shows to film ❤
You should have a flipped season where all the experts have to try to remake all the dumb shit the Guys have invented but actually good
I still want a reverse WAR where they challenge 4 experts to make something without a recipe and the Try Guys judge them
One of the things that I think is really impressive about Keith is that he's able to see when he's messed something up really badly, toss it out, and then make something to fill the gap that isn't perfect but works. He might not be the BEST cook but he's got some genuine skill that just needs a recipe.
I love the judges' reactions when Keith brought out his smores- Noelle was concerned but hopeful, whilst Jonny & Rosanna were like 'oh god not again' 😂
this is the first WAR where I vehemently disagree with the judges. Zach should NOT have come in 4th place over Marissa, whose marshmallow literally almost made a judge vomit. out of all of the s'mores, I wanted to try Zach's the most. I am happy that Eugene won, tho. those tartlets looked so pretty! 😍
Johnny was FIGHTING for all of the creations to be considered s’mores 😂 that Keith mouth comparison had me dying 😂
im absolutely living for eugene's fancy 'mellows
""We clearly forget the rubric. We have a rubric and we just say f*ck the rubric!"" That line took me OUT 😂😂 I love Zach lol
I don't know why but when Johnny said ""mama this is a smore."" Made me smile because it reminds me of all the failed and ugly attempts I've had at making something and my aunts or older cousins would be like ""mama this is good. You did good.""
Keith and Eugene bring fun and wholesome energy. Marissa and Zach bring low key competitive siblings who are grasping at straws to finish the assignment
Something about her sweet tone of voice gives Rosanna the same energy as a kindergarten teacher trying to use gentle parenting techniques on a student who just brought a dead squirrel off the road for show and tell.
Only 10 seconds in and Eugene WILLINGLY going in for a hug from Keith - initiating it! - has sent me to another plane of existence.  So happy!
Eugene just happily and casually hugging Keith and Keith being surprised is just so wholesome considering Eugene doesn't like being hugged 🥹🥹🥹
Eugene, the one who made Ro throw up, comforting Melissa, the one who almost made Ro throw up, is so funny 😂
Eugene helping Keith this time? How the tables have turned.

The hugs and kisses from Eugene at the beginning were so cute too 🥺

I like how they reacted more to the Artisan S'more Shop owner than any of the multi-Michelin star chefs they've invited before.
I love the fact that Marissas cookie/cracker was THAT good - compared to her marshmellow-jello😂 What a save",23,Comedy,8060000,PT54M7S

Villa Park has become a scary place to play 😳 15-0 straight wins
As someone from the Caribbean we don't have much players from our region who've ever graced the Prem, so best believe when Bailey does well we all take pride.
Bailey has really been dangerous these last few weeks. Looking like our danger man whenever he gets the ball these days. UTV
Speaking from a Liverpool fan, 15 consecutive home wins is very impressive
Dibu also in impressive form, letting him go was one of Arteta's blunder. He's better than both Raya and Ramsdale.
After Man City match, I had a feeling that Arsenal would lose tonight because Villa now has the quality to be a true title contender imo. As an Arsenal fan for 20 years, ups and downs being nature, I start to admire the enemy, no hatred, less emotional, if we lose we take it because every player on the pitch give their absolute 100%. A good team is a good team. We have to admit that!
Speedy recovery for Bailey 🙏🏼 let’s do this villains let’s make history 😎🇯🇲🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
As a Liverpool fan, I also congratulate Aston Villa. Since Unai Emery became coach of Aston Villa, this team has played very well and impressively. What a match
Dibu Martinez world number #1!!! Aston Villa beautiful win!! Sending all my love to all the Aston Villa fans !!! Greetings from Canada 🇨🇦.
Истинные фанаты Виллы могут гордиться ею, в этом сезоне они ещё прибавили, и третье текущее место с 15 домашними победами вселяют надежду и интригу на конец чемпионата. Мы верим в команду. Привет из Волгограда💪
Aston villa is a winning machine! Good defense, good attack, the best goalkeeper! It is the most exciting team on the premier league. Go Aston ☝️✊️💪.
So exciting to see Aston Villa and New Castle back.. feels like vintage days
Leon Bailey what a player, he is on 🔥🔥🔥
Even when you're not playing at your absolute best, and can still grind out the results - that's a sign of a team that's going to do something special.
Considering Emery's tough time at Arsenal, his english was even mocked by his own players, this win is a sweet revenge.. Congrats Emery..
Great performance from villa but I think not enough people are talking about how good Havertz was, some of his passing was amazing
Congrats to Aston Villa, from a LFC fan! Your goalie is badass. Vamos Emiliano Martinez!
Emi Martinez showed everyone why he is the number 1. Great performance!
As a chelsea fan, I am so jealous of this team right now! Damn you guys are on fire right now and i hope it can continue until the end of season!",17,Sports,442000,PT3M3S

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1289,"Scary thing is this wasn’t even the worst performance of the season they have played worse against teams and won
Onana’s shot stopping comparison is a T-Rex 🦖  literally no arms!
Mark last week: Ten Hag Masterclass
Mark this week: We are a disgrace
😂😂😂
Chelsea had an awful game last game, it wasn’t that Man Utd were amazing, it was the fact that chelsea had the worst performance of their season!
We lost fair and square to a better team.
It’s very simple Chelsea didn’t play as well as this team did today. So Manchester looked good
Thought Chelsea and today were similar performances. Conceded a load of chances in both and looked on front foot. Chelsea couldn’t finish but Bournemouth could, long way to go for this team. Manager still makes same mistakes picking certain players every game
Congrats Goldbridge on predicting 3-0 scoreline👍👍👍👍
Mark has lost it...Talking about inconsistency. We have been good in one game this season, at home to Chelsea. Its factual. Defending this manager is incomprehensible.
Threw the game. They don’t want Ten Hag and they showed it and your captain doesn’t want to play Liverpool. Imagine Robson doing that?
What have you actually seen from Ten Hag to suggest he’s the right man. Like, he’s not won multiple champions leagues and dominated a top league before like a Klopp or Guardiola. I agree half the team needs clearing out but it’s also entirely possible he isn’t up to the job either. I’m genuinely shocked at how tactically naive he is and how unable he is able to actually address glaring issues in the set up.
“We’ll probably beat Bayern” 😂

Never learn goldbridge, never learn 👏😂
It’s baffling how you draw conclusions based on only looking at the performance of one team. Bournemouth outplayed Villa last week and Palace in the week. This result was no surprise to a lot of Bournemouth fans and it makes it more funny when you predicted an easy 3-0 win without doing the simplest, most cursory homework on your opposition. Up the Cherries 🍒
Our captains ""accidental"" yellow card.....
It's almost ridiculous to say we played brilliantly against Chelsea. If we had played against City or Liverpool instead of Chelsea that day, we would have conceded at least 5 goals. STILL, ETH OUT
I don't understand how you can believe this team can beat Bayern on Tuesday and at the same time not recognise that the manager is likely to be the most culpable.  He chose the captain and he carries responsibility for motivating the team.  If you think the players are good enough to beat Bayern then it seems to me that we must have the quality but not the leadership.  Personally I think we lack passion and aggression, too many prima donnas on the pitch and no Roy Keane to remind them what the job is during the game.
Onana is the biggest problem, he's simply 5 inches shorter than he should be. The other problem is the utter failure to find a ManU standard number 9 (van Persie was probably the last one).
I've come to realise that Shaw can't play LCB without Varane there to guide him.

Whoever plays with Varane looks good because he's such a good organiser and reader of the game.
ETH has made a lot of mistakes. Not handling players like he should, overpaying and bringing in mediocre footballers, overtraining players hence our long injury list, no clear tactics. It's like we've got an identity crisis. He was never the right manager to begin with. Give Klopp or Pep 400 million and they'll buy league winning players. ETH has no pulling power it's just the brand doing everything. We're done this guy needs to go.
Biggest misstake was not to listen to Ragnick. This players would not have been here if the club listen to him .",17,Sports,1790000,PT23M7S

From Bethesda and Arkane Lyon, the studio that brought you Dishonored and “DEATHLOOP”, Marvel’s Blade is a mature, single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris, now in development in collaboration with Marvel Games.

If Blade turns out to be as good as Dishonored 2, it will be a memorable experience. Being 100% single-player is a great start.
I could’ve shed a tear when they said it’ll be a third-person single player game.

Thank you Arkane Lyon!
Getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most Blade thing ever
SO glad that a gameplay-focused studio like Arkane is doing Blade, some of the most fluid Gun/Sword gameplay in the Biz.
Perfect mix of character, studio and platform!
Can't wait to see more of this!
Finally!!!!! One of my favorite characters gets his own game. I love the dark, ominous feel that this has. 3rd person single player too? Yes please.
Ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it. I just get excited that someone is making blade.
Loving the art style already. This is definitely going to be visually stunning
Love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop. It gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires.
Esto será un gran juego, gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
THIS!!! A BLADE Game is a FANTASTIC idea. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾This has so much potential the artstyle, colour and lighting is astonishing. The character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and Blade looks like he came straight off the pages. 

And the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed, the elements of Dishonoured and Deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit Blades combat and abilities. Out of the upcoming marvel games this is my Favourite.
Glad to see Blade gets a new game. Hopefully they will do the character justice. Fingers crossed.
The fact that we’re getting the game before the movie is bizarre but I’m so excited I can’t wait for it. This looks so dope.
Esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais, bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos!!!
Vou voltar aqui todos os dias para apreciar essa obra de arte
Muito interessante,aparentemente sera uma animação linda
Se imaginan ahora un universo de videojuegos de marvel. Esto sin duda sera mejor q el cine ya que es algo que podemos vivir en carne propia sino q tendra total libertad creativa a la hora de tratar a los personajes y mas profundidad

Lyrics:
Hotels
Late nights
Hands through my hair
Long talks
Red eyes
Clothes everywhere
Missing a moment when you’re still there
You gotta thing you can’t find nowhere 

Yeah-yeah
Kissing
Screaming
Straight back to war
I’m walking out until I lock the door
Maybe the danger’s covered by the thrill
Cause I know I should be running for the hills 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me
And keep me around like it’s easy
Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

I know that when it’s all done
I’ll hate you bad in the long run
But somehow it never ends
My heels on the edge of your bed again, yeah
I get obsessive with you
All that I want is attention from you
Break into my life and break all my rules, it’s true 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me 
And keep me around like it’s easy  

Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

Should be running for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Huh huh

This style of Todd is pretty neat
I love that clever detail where Shawn has to lick his hoof in order to grab the card and pick it up. 😄
Todd popping his brain out over figuring out the basic math on the playing cards is absolutely mind-blowing.
It’s a shame this could never be completed, but regardless, this was wonderful!
Very cool animation as always, hope that arm is feeling better
I dunno why, but Todd tapping the table (0:35) while trying to understand the game is weirdly adorable.
Piemations needs his own movie
Hope you will recover from your wrist pain. Amazing animation as always!
This would’ve looked like such an amazing show if it came to be!
Gee, I'm gonna miss this show, but putting your health first is something that we should all value. The sake of entertainment isn't cheap. Thank you for creating such an awesome piece of animation.
So this is the canonical ending. Todd tries to do basic maths and dies.

I salute you, Sheriff Hayseed. You were fun whilst you lasted
Super unique and stylized! Shame Hayseed isn't gonna be finished :(
For one side i get why It got canceled, the artstyle is amazing and way too high effort for a small team to pull It out with out massive crutch... But in the other side i would love seeing this getting a Full budget and becoming yet another great YouTube Indie animated series
I'll miss this guy. Hope your arm gets better eventually
Love it, Pie! I really dig the new style! I know it's been hard to animate with the pain in your wrists lately, but you still did an awesome job with this! Kudos and looking forward to any new material you may put out going forward!! 👍
It's really unfortunate that this got cancelled, I love the animation and the style change looks really nice
It's a shame the show is going on indeterminate hiatus, I really like these two's chemistry.
I absolutely love how Todd's fangs are consistently drawn into every frame. I'm so used to people only drawing the fangs during times of aggression that's its nice for them to just _be there_ naturally.

Petit conseil pour éviter que le bouchon ne saute : bien conserver les bouteilles de cidre debout et les mettre au frais quelques heures avant la consommation comme pour le jus de pomme pétillant, dégustation au top garantie ;) ! Concernant les pommes, pour le jus de pomme il s'agit de variétés de pommes à jus plutôt acidulées et douces, pour le cidre, nous sélectionnons une vingtaine de variétés de pommes à cidre pour notre production et pour ce cidre elles sont en majorité douces-amères et amères. En tout cas, on est super heureux de voir tous ces produits de notre cher Pays Bigouden si bien représentés, au plaisir de t'accueillir à Pouldreuzic lors d'un de tes séjours en France !
Je préfère largement ce genre de vidéo avec un montage qui va pas à mille à l'heure. C'est plus ""authentique"", tu n'as pas besoin de te forcer à rythmer à fond la vidéo, c'est parfait comme ça :).
Petites précisions pour les crêpes : dans l’est de la Bretagne on dit crêpe et galette et dans l’Ouest crêpe froment et crêpe de blé noir
Sinon très bonne vidéo. Content que la cuisine bretonne t’aie autant plu ! 😊
Je suis déçu que cette blague ait passée inaperçu : "" Il est temps de cidre-drater (s'hydrater) "" !
Encore une vidéo top, gros merci ! :D
faut se le dire nos amis bretons sont vraiment trop forts, lors de mon voyage en bretagne j’ai enchaîné les restaus et plats traditionnels, j’ai tellement kiffé qu’à la fin du séjour j’avais pris 3kg mais je regrette pas c’était incroyablement bon sa race !
Oh mais ouiii quel plaisir je viens de la Bretagne et je vis au Québec, cette vidéo me fait tant plaisir de voir un québécois aussi connu que toi mettre en valeur notre culture culinaire !!!🤩
En tant que Breton, je suis content et fier de te voir goûter nos produits locaux et si il y a des similitude entre nos produits Bretons et vos produits Québecois c'est parce que Jacques Cartier est venu chez vous et depuis nous avons créé des liens et surtout avec nous les Malouins et ce depuis bientôt 500 ans et pour l'anecdote au Québec et au Manitoba 2 villes portent le nom de Saint-Malo dû à ce partenariat entre ces pays 🤍🖤 !
En tant que breton je peut te dire que t'a bien été conseillé pour les produits ahah que des super trucs ^^
En tant que Douarneniste, j’ai adoré cette vidéo. On en veut plus, toujours plus !
Je vie au Japon et j'ai eu deux enfants. Ma grand mère bretonne m'a directement envoyé les mêmes boles, avec nos noms dessus.
Du coup on a tous notre bole (même ma femme qui s'appelle Maï a réussi à avoir le sien). Du coup ils sont officiellement japonais ET Breton
J'ai eu mal au cœur quand j'ai vu le kig ah farz en bocal et comment il a été cuisiné ! 🥲 On a pas été respectés là. 
Super vidéo, merci !
Ça serait génial « un québécois découvre les spécialités du pays basque » magnifique région et traditions !!
Vivant en Bretagne depuis 10 ans et avec un breton pur souche nous avons ete ravis de voir que tu avais apprécié les plats de Bretagne. 
Les bretons sont un peuple conservateurs, fier et tres gentils quand on prends le temps de les connaitre et quon apprecie leur culture. 
Alors merci pour cette dégustation
😁😁😁
Et bisou du Finistère ! De Morlaix même
Vive la Bretagne et les bretons ! Nous sommes fiers que notre nourriture traverse le monde 
Je tiens à te remercier pour cette vidéo mais je tiens surtout à remercier tous les Bretons pour avoir apporté dans ce monde le Kouign-amann ♥",24,Entertainment,248000,PT16M12S

#TomPetty #LoveIsALongRoad #GTA6",2794,"Tom Petty got a whole new generation of fans, Rockstar always has good taste
It hit so hard when I heard the first few notes in the trailer. RIP Legend

Soon, we’ll be back in Vice City brothers
This song is going to be stuck in my head for the next 10-15 years. Thanks Rockstar and especially thanks to Tom Petty for having produced such a master piece! Rest well!
This song will be remembered for a long time, a perfect Rockstar Games choice.
RIP Tom. A whole new generation of fans over a 90 second trailer. You will live forever.
80s music will truly never die
Love that a younger generation is discovering a true American Icon. RIP Tom, you’re a legend.
Why does older music always hit 10x's harder than modern music? This is so good, and I feel so stupid for sleeping on this masterpiece for all these years.
Been a huge Tom Petty fan for decades and I can only applaud a new generation of fans coming in. Truly timeless rock music!
The fact that this song is finally getting the respect it’s always had but from a younger generation eases my heart! Can’t wait to hear the playlists they got lined up! I’m 42 years old! I’ve loved this song since I first heard it in late 80’s headed into the 90’s Tom Petty was born 10 years late and for great measure! Now as an older man, who just hopes he can play the next gta! Not sure if I’ll make it to 7, but I’m hoping I can make it rdr3! But hey that’s the rockstar life! Cheers to Tom Petty the coolest rockstar there ever was! Dude quit touring and was like, time to OD! Gangster! RIP!
This music is going to be stuck in my head until 2025... A such masterpiece
One thing Rockstar never disappoints us with is good taste for music
Tom would be so blown away and appreciative of the new love this track is getting. The entire album is a banger and worth checking out.
This is actually one of the best albums ever made. Welcome new fans. :)
We miss you so much Tom. Thank you for the glorious wealth of real music you left us.❤❤🎉
essa musica vai entrar para historia
Esse cantor ja se tornou uma lenda e vai ser lembrado sempre... Se ele estivesse vivo estaria pulando de felicidade por ver sua música fazendo muito sucesso.
La primera vez que escuchó una canción de este cantante y la verdad me encanto,soy muy fans de las canciones de los 80,y esta canción encaja perfectamente en mis gustos
Essa e uma das melhores músicas que ja vi em um trailer

Jack Harlow was smooth and held his own and Dave gotta be one of the most sickest rappers to walk the earth
Dave has literally mastered rapping at whatever pace he chooses. So relaxed and smooth man
Dave is properly a master at the verses that go on for ages. This is probably the best song I’ve heard from Jack too
Shout out to all the LOAN survivors 🙌
UK rappers are finally getting love in the US. It took way too long but anyone who hasn't been following UK Grime and Drill is going to be surprised at the talent that's been overlooked.
Harlow went fucking crazy! One of his top tracks for sure 🔥🔥
Dave is genuinely an expert at the lengthy verses. I think this is Jack's best song yet as well.
Jack’s really following his mentors footsteps with this level of consistency, he is really going places.
Man Jack’s progression is crazy🔥
Jack&dave never disappoints
They both slid!!! This beat is absolutely perfect on the ears I wouldn't mind a collaboration album from these two!! Dave is that guy !!!
Both artists ending the year with an absolute banger
The collab we didn't know we needed! Blown away both went crazy
Dope bars from both artists! The end of year collabo we didn't expect.
Can't get over how well this video is shot. Videography + editing on another level! Huge props to Cole and the crew.
This is so fire, artist's need to make more songs like this.
Jack's best verse by far, well done. Dave snapped as usual.
As espected from Dave and Jack - perfect lyrics, rythm and sound
Dave is so good with words... Look at the bars and how collected and smooth he is. Top notch delivery😊",24,Entertainment,21500000,PT4M41S

Rated Mature",6785,"The fact they made a Free DLC is insane! Thank you PlayStation and Santa Monica Studios! You are the best
This came out of nowhere and I AM SCREAMINGGGGG. Cant express the amount of love i have for this game🤩
Santa Monica is just on an entirely different level as a dev studio.  Incredible.
The greek theme...I love this. Imagine kratos on a self-reflective journey where the final boss of the DLC is his young greek self. That would be crazy.
It is so rare these days to see a company genuinely care about their fans. Thank you Santa Monica. I will always buy your games
Kratos brutalizing enemies to his old music just hits different. And after followng his journey, ending with his new music feels very special.
The feels I just got. THIS IS WHAT GAMING USED TO FEEL LIKE!!
Thank you Santa Monica and Sony for, not only DLC to an amazing game, but the fact that it's free and not hidden behind a paywall. Very rare these days and hopefully other companies follow this standard.
Its heart warming to see one of the oldest gaming studios giving back to the gaming community, sending love!
Thank you Playstation and Santa Monica Studios for giving back to the gaming community. You guys truly are the best there is and I really hope other companies learn from the example you have set 🙏🏽
Gente, eu sou contra empresas gigantes sendo endeusadas, mas a Santa Monica Studio nunca me decepcionar. Eu sou eternamente grato às pessoas que fizeram esse jogo, pois fez parte da minha infância e manteve a qualidade, até superando! ❤
I was already going to play this game soon, but the dlc just makes me even more excited to play it
A trilha sonora do classico como é bom ouvir ela de novo
Santa Monica Studios literally never misses! I love these games to death.❤
This is the best DLC ever in gaming history and it's free.

Thank you PlayStation and Santa Monica Studio for this Masterpiece.
Escutar a música antiga deu até  calafrios de emoção!

Congratulations!! 🙌🏻
🍼 Congrats Lauren, Bobby, Melody and Dexter!
🍼 congratulations! So happy for you all. Sorry you’ve had some dodgy things go on with social media making you worried, some people can be scary. Looking forward to the fun baby content 😊
i’ve watched for you years and it’s insane how everything has changed. it’s a good change. you’re doing great lauren! congratulations 🍼
seeing my childhood youtubers live their lives is a fantastic thing. SO HAPPY FOR YOU
CONGRATS!!! As another 31 year old toddler mom I have loved watching your content especially on my hard busy days. You make me laugh and ease my day which as you know us moms need sooooooo much 🍼🐥
I'm sorry to hear things have been rough for you, Lauren, and congrats on the new baby! seeing Melody playing around was so cute, she seemed so energetic. Just take your time to get things together and do things at a steady pace, no rush ^^
Congratulations! So excited for you. I am praying for a great future for you all. Take it slow, and get lots of sleep. 🎉
So glad to hear about the news and glad you found your area! Stay healthy, stay the galaxy-deer queen you are, Lauren, best wishes! 🍼
congratulations! 🍼 take your time with the kiddos, its a big life step and we all understand the stress that is bringing you. people are sucky and totally understand how apathetic the internet has become. been watching your content for quite a few years now and you inspire me a lot, and understand the burnout feeling. it sucks when something you enjoy feels like a chore. we'll still be here enjoying your content when you upload! :))))) 💜
Lauren I’ve been following this channel since before you and Bobby got married. Now you’re having your second child and it’s so unreal that life has changed so much. Congratulations to you and your family. Hoping for a safe pregnancy.
Congratulations to the three of you, 🎉Lauren,  Bobby and Meldoy 🎉❤️ so happy you been well even though it's been bit chaotic. So cute to see Meldoy be a Big sister!  🍼
Congratulations!! Take some time for yourself, we love you Lauren!!🍼🍼
Congratulations Lauren!!!! We love you and are here to support you always!!!! Praying for you!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🍼
I'm so happy for you I was smiling through the whole video. I can't wait to hear more, even if it's only a little bit.
I think I can speak for most of us when I say we totally support and understand your decision to keep your life more private.
You do what keeps your family safe and healthy.
I've watched you since I was about 14 years old, so for roughly 4 years now and it's been great to see you learn and become the mother you are.
You have been an inspiration, and I wish you a happy and healthy family.
Live a good and long life!🍼
🍼 GIRL CONGRATS!! 🎉 Our youngest (my only bio child) is 5 and I totally feel you on the birth not being a fun part 😂 you’re a rockstar!
🍼 I'm super happy for you both Lauren! I don't watch this channel as often anymore but I definitely still support you guys.
And I 100% with your assessment of the house - your life is a mess right now, the house doesn't need to be perfect. 
In fact, your surroundings will indirectly show what you are going through. 
That being: Yes! It's a mess, but it won't be the end of the world and it will get ""cleaned up"" so to speak.
 I hope your pregnancy continues to be quick for you so that it doesn't become too taxing on your health.
Best wishes!
Congratulations to the both of you, we can’t wait to meet the baby!

www.jurassicparksurvival.com",6126,"Holy cow, not only is it a ""Jurassic Park"" game instead of ""Jurassic World"" to change it up, but it's a an official survival horror game we've been wanting for years? 🤯
If this is anything like Alien Isolation then we're in for the biggest treat ever. Man I love that they're going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place.
It's incredible how Jurassic Park has a different sense of tension than Jurassic World
YES FINALLY!!! I've been waiting for something like this for years 😭
To me the Ford Explorer and Jeep Wrangler will forever be the real heroes of Jurassic Park. Takes me right back to my childhood.
I can't believe they're making an actual Jurassic Park survival horror game! This looks incredible, the attention to level of detail e.g the Ford Explorer, the Jeep Wrangler, the Dinosaurs. I like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of Jurassic Park.

Hopefully this game doesn't disappoint.
I’ve always wanted a Jurassic Park game like this!!
As a huge Dino fan. This is something I’m eyeing the most to come out, I don’t care how short or long. I can tell I’m going to throughly enjoy this
The original island....the original park! This feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90's. I don't even play new games anymore, but I'm really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan. 💿 🎥
It seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now ! It looks promising !🦖💯
I've been imagining a game like this for about 20 years. They finally made one.
I’ve never wanted anything more in my life. I KNEW they were gonna do something like this at some point. So happy to finally see it.
This is what I’ve been wanting from Jurassic park!!
The makers of Jurassic World must take note from this game. This is what a true Jurassic movie should look and feel like. We need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies.
What I would really like in the game Jurassic Park Survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park, and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993, it would be completely crazy. For example we have the Proceratosaurus, the Metriacanthosaurus, the Segisaurus, Herrerasaurus and the Baryonyx, this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of Jurassic Park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear, just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film, it allows us to fill a void. 🙏
I'm going to need more gameplay footage.  Looks suspiciously like a jump-scare funhouse, walk and look adventure.
This looks incredible. Already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay. Thanks for sharing this trailer!
The music,the scenes,the dinos,same place! Everything is on point! I bet playing this will feel like a Jurassic park sequel but you are in it.
Look at how much love went into making this trailer! I haven't felt the magic this strongly since the first movie.

Lyrics:
I was missin in action like Chrisean tooth Back letting loose like a nigga had to point Imma god in Memphis who bigger than me The shit that they did I did at 16
He flexing his money we know that he broke Dick in her mouth NLE throat coat
He pressed bout a girl that’s fucking the city He tender we call him diddy
Choppa so big knock the weight off biggie I’m some like pussy this shit a get sticky Got me in that mode ion plan on glitching I’m back, nigga like I had an addiction
Dropped him Lego
He couldn’t take those Switches and dracos Shooters on payroll
Nigga don’t won’t no smoke they snoop dog We show up to yo door like uhaul
Lil nigga with a pistol stand tall
Quick to pop a nigga ass like a Adderall
Shaking the spot like a ass or some
Lil bruh sped he crash for none
Walk out the house with a mask and gun Better hold yo breath like a asthma pump
I move like the pope
100 some shots inna ghost
Better think twice don’t approach No regular Glocks
Know that it came with a box
We stepping like shoes and socks
One of the realest how can you not mention we slid out a civic now rolls Royce whippin She sucking and spitting double jerking twisting killing my kids like abortion clinics
Take some from who he line man
Nigga don’t feel like dying man
Cook em like grease in a frying pan
We don kilt mo niggas then the klansman
Kkk got ks on ks wanna fuck Kim k and make Kanye watch

WOOO-EEE folks. Let me tell ya, I did NOT intend for this to be such a huge project, but when Nick and I pulled up to the marketplace seller's driveway and realized this dollhouse was 5 literal feet tall, I knew I was in for a doozy. But who would I be if I let that stop me? So HERE WE GO. 
I've been seeing a lot of people online turning dollhouses into gingerbread houses, and I wanted a piece of that whimsical action. I felt like this Frozen Arendelle dollhouse would be PERFECT for a little Victorian twist. So I grabbed my spray paint, fake icing and pure determination to make this giant lady a SNACK.
Please enjoy heheheeh

#gingerbread #dollhouse #upcycling",1392,"When you said, ""What would Christine McConnell do,"" I thought, ""She'd probably bake individual shingles out of gingerbread, each with a unique design copied directly from historically-accurate examples of Victorian wallpaper, but with her own spooky spin of including a bat or a mouse in the corner of each, only visible with a magnifying glass that she.cast out of poured sugar...."" and then I got tired just from thinking about the work that goes into her (and your) projects and got a snack.
If you put the piping tip inside the snipped bag before you fill it with ""icing"" and then it stays in place while you pipe. <3
Welcome to a Rachel Maksy video where we all ask ourselves, ""What will she turn brown today?"" (with the occasional green thing)  😆  It turned out great!  Also, try putting the icing tip inside the baggie.
My 2 year old just said, “That is a cute house.” 

You have the Toddler Seal of Approval 👌
I feel like this is the home of the queen to whom your lil mouse knight pledges allegiance ❤️
You could display your gingerbread house on your porch for the season. I think it would be cute. It turned out great, by the way. The appropriate amount of whimsy.
Tip if you ever find yourself doing icing like this again: cut a hole in the pastry bag/sandwich bag and put the tip inside the bag so the tip of it comes out the hole, then twist the bag above the icing/caulk and squeeze with your hand on top of the bulb of icing/caulk. You'll get more control this way and won't have to hold the tip in place! This is how I was taught to ice cake/cookies when I worked in a bakery. :)
You made a sweet gingerbread hostel for all of your felt creatures to slumber for winter!  LOVE IT SO MUCH!!
The idea of Rachel being like ""ah yes I will do a small project! A little gingerbread house!"" And then receiving a huge castle is so funny 😂

Rachael's reaction to the size of the dollhouse was my reaction to every project I undertake. Super simple no problems at... OH MY GOSH. So relatable and delightful.
Next step, make each room Victorian themed and make miniatures. ❤
I just started watching and I am so filled with affection for Rachel, looking completely overwhelmed by the size of this monstrosity and yet also giddy with the prospect of gingerbreadifying it. Rachel Maksy, Patron Saint of Chaotic Crafters. <3
""You took a DNA test and Bob is, in fact, your uncle."" 😂😂😂❤ The gingerbread house turned out SO CUTE!
Tip for the windows:
A lot of people will use sheets of gelatin as the glass in real gingerbread houses 🥰
The peppermint patty-o was a stroke of genius.  Love it!
As someone who is a baker but also does decoden, here's some tips:  The icing tip goes inside of the bag lol. You cut the tip of the bag off, put the icing tip inside and then put your silicone in the bag. You can twist the top of the bag, rubber band it, zip tie it etc to keep the silicone from oozing out the top and it also gives you more control of the bag with applying pressure.  If you ever want to add color to your silicone you can use mica or oil based paint, no water-based colors because it will cause the silicone to seize up and then you cant pipe it!
If Rachel and Nick ever chose to have kids, they are gonna have the most whimsical childhoods.
This is becoming such a cool trend! I drove to another province to pick up one of these houses with my friend back in October so she could make an awesome haunted house for Halloween. It turned out amazing!! I love how this is catching on 🔥
Rachael's response to the dollhouse's size mirrored my own feelings toward each project I work on. Extremely easy, no issues at all... Oh my god. So enjoyable and relatable.",24,Entertainment,1200000,PT18M57S

-Crush walls in seconds
-Fly over walls

And Supercell be like:""The new level wall costs 9 MILLION coins per wall.""
😐
Isn't it funny how the cost of leveling up walls increases and the amount of troops with special abilities to go through walls also increases 😅
As a th11, I can confidently say that I'll be excited for this update in around a decade
it's amazing how far coc has come, even after 10 years i still have so much fun playing this game!!
They really made attacking at TH15 more user-friendly by introducing an OP new troop, dang

Super wall breaker would be vanished from th 16 in some extent 😂😂😂 
But loved to see new troop at new Townhall
I expect a nerf coming soon even though it's not yet officially released. This new troop is definitely overpowered. 😅
I feel like a lot of older troops are left out. Valkyrie is an apparent one, but pekka is also significantly downgraded once electro titan is announced. They should make a buff to the unusable troops.
This new troop is truly amazing! I can't wait to try it! I see it as a little slow but they have unstoppable power!
The troop is pretty interesting. It seems kind of op at this moment. It adds so much value to a hero dive without taking much space. Also seems superior to a lot of popular troops like electro titans and hogs. Interesting to see how it works out. Seems like it could break th 15 a bit
I cant wait to see the root rider dominate in pro games.
I think that the apprentice warden is going to pair really well with it. It boosts its health so much and if im not wrong it can jump over walls, if not root riders will break them anyways. 
The extra hp will be of great value, especially if u use a qc root rider attack
For the ones Who noticed two Icons above the King. 

New blacksmith building is coming to have different abilities for heroes.
Upcoming sneak peak I think It will be on our heroes( Ability charging option) or somethingmore cooler.
 I am so much excited before seeing it. 😊😊😊
I liked the troop but I think they could have game her a better ability with the root manipulation concept. Like using the roots to force stop defenses for limited amount of time.
I think they are kinda bad due to their low dps. They are more like pseudo tank that crushes walls along the way and isnt prone to spring traps so I can see them being used instead of ice golems sometimes. I think their best use case would be with super bowler smash since you would be able to use it without jump due to how good they are at breaking walls.
Always my first stop for all the new update information. Thanks Judo! All of the videos, as always, are well designed and very informative. You and the other content creators are as much a part of the game as the game itself. Keep it up my friend.
Honestly I feel like I’ve really underestimated the quality educational entertainment from just being lead through an attack strategy with basic commentary! Keep it up, Judo!
To add to what judo said about using super wall breakers for king pathing. The root riders are just a normal troop whereas the super wall breaker is a super troop so you don't have use your dark elixir or super potion. I'm definitely looking forward to this troop 🔥🔥🔥",20,Gaming,2730000,PT9M1S

I approve
No way new HelloGames game?!

I love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that NMS trailers usually are.
Can't wait for this, looks beautiful!
The fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very, very good thing. That's a sign that they're aiming for density on a much smaller scale, despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
I genuinely cannot wait.  You guys are some of the hardest working devs around and I really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making NMS an incredible game. I’m more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything I love in one game. So excited!!
Seeing how far they've come with NMS compared to its initial release makes this game very promising. Even if it's not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning, we no they're 100% capable of making it better over time.
As a NMS player since day one, I'm all in for Light No Fire!
After the (eventual) epic success of NMS, Hello Games is now one of the few game developers I trust to deliver. I can't wait to explore this world.
I like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on (Larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year), I am genuinely excited for this! I can see this being a huge improvement from NMS for the simple reason it's just one world which they can build on density.
Having witnessed the commitment they have shown to No Mans Sky, I’m all in on this. (Also No Mans Sky on PSVR2 is INSANE!)
Love the artstyle!! Looks really interesting and after delivering NMS you really deserve that this will be a success!
What I’m hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards, and some kind of engaging story. If they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
Everything about this is pure vibes. The atmosphere, the track selection for the video, the editing. Very well done. Cannot wait to play this!!!
I don’t even know how I feel, no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre, and you guys delivered that 🎉😂 can’t wait
I just want to say, I'm a huge fan of your guys' work. You guys put passion first and money second, unlike the vast majority of companies today.
Feels like a natural next step from something like Valheim, which is probably my favourite game ever. Excited for this. The redemption story is nearly fully complete.
I cherish each of you! transforming an incredible system into a fantastical setting. Great choice of song as well; I adore Alt-J. I'm already very excited about this.
This looks great. Take your time guys. It's done when it's done. Don't let yourselves get pushed like last time. You've build a lot of good will over the years, the community is ready to wait and let you cook.
I remember playing nms and thinking about how much better it would be if you guys focused all the procedural content into one planet  (  not saying your procedural universe was bad )  turns out you guys were already making that a reality long before I ever even conceived it....I dont usually get hyped for games....but I am completely hyped for this one.
This is going to be an amazing experience. I hope it has full mod support.",20,Gaming,115000,PT2M6S
CA,eGk4w1DYPmc,Ryan O'Neal Dead at 82,Entertainment Tonight,2023-12-08T22:24:49Z,Ryan O'Neal,475659,4488,"Ryan O'Neal, best known for his Oscar-nominated role in 1970's 'Love Story,' has died. According to his son, O'Neal died peacefully on Friday. O'Neal also starred in 1973's 'Paper Moon' alongside his daughter, actress Tatum O'Neal, and the two had a tumultuous relationship in the years that followed. He's also dad to son Redmond, whom he shared with his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett. He was 82 years old.",933,"So sad . Rip Ryan. Was a great actor. Condolences to his children and grand kids .
Hopefully Tatum finally gets to heal. For most people who had toxic parents, after they die, they get to finally close that chapter and retrieve their lives. I really REALLY hope Tatum soars and is finally at peace, free from all that toxicity ♥️
I'm glad Ryan and Tatum got to take that photo together after so many years, everything came full circle after the drama in their lives, RIP Ryan.
Condolences to Ryan’s family, especially Tatum and Redmond…..

 He was a very good actor and will be missed.
Done well to reach 82yrs. RIP. We all have our struggles to deal with. No one is perfect.  Papermoon is timeless classic!
I always wished I could chat with Tatum about her dad. It's tough to have a parent that's an alcoholic and is emotionally distant from you, especially when he divorces your mother, and you feel like you've been replaced. Despite all of that, I hope in the end they were able to mend their relationship-not just for his sake but for hers as well. Carrie Fischer once quoted her famous mother saying, ""Resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die."" My wish for them both is that they forgave each other for whatever and were able to say, ""I love you."" before it was too late.
My sincerest condolences to Ryan's family and friends.  I loved him in ""Love Story"". So sad to see our childhood icons move on to another plain. Rest in peace 💔
​death comes at any time for anyone we have to be prepared, for our final hour we are immortal only the body dies the soul lives forever, I hope he finds peace.
I feel so sad for his children - My condolences for all the grieving they have gone through. ❤
I still remember sitting in the movie theater and sobbing   - along with a lot of other teenage girls in the audience.  Love Story   something about the music, film locations, and cast that  were timeless.

Condolences to Ryan’s family, especially Tatum and Redmond….. He was a very good actor and will be missed.
I would like to give my condolences to the family of Ryan O'Neal ,he was an outstanding Actor.I did not see every movie that he made but I seen a number of them.RIP Mr O'Neal.
I actually feel sorry for Tatum more than anything.
I worked on a movie with him as a crew member. He was nothing but professional wanting to do his best performance....like he wanted the glory of Love Story. I felt sorry for him on many levels noticing how hard he was on himself after a take second guessing himself and genuinely trying to give his best performance REST IN PIECE MR O NIEL
Death is always sad...sometimes a welcomed release but sad. My love goes out to his family. Rest in peace Ryan.
My heart goes out to tatum. It's hard when a parent dies and leaves things unresolved with you. Much like tatum provably felt, you wait a lifetime for that person to change because no matter what else they are they are still your latent. Sadly I know this too well
Aside from him as a father and person, I think he was a fabulous actor and he made wonderful movies. My heart goes out to poor Tatum. I hope she found some kind of closure with her father.
I always admired him as an actor. It’s a shame he wasn’t a very good father. His children really suffered because of it. I hope they can put it behind them and heal now.
He was one of the greatest actors of our time. Rest in power 
Mr O'nesl ....  and  Thank You.
Ryan was an honorable actor. His private life didn’t fit the same category. We are not perfect parents. I am so happy, the family was able to reunite, and reconcile their past “for the most part” My thoughts and prayers go out to his sons, and especially Tatum. I always worry about her. I pray to God, she is able to get some peace finally! She definitely deserves it! I also experienced a bad abusive childhood, but when my dad closed his eyes., he took all of that with him. So I really hope that she can gain just a fraction of some hope here. One thing for sure, Ryan fiercely fought the last 23 years of his life. I gotta hand it to him he’s really strong! I’m praying and thinking of you Tatum! All of your fans are! We hope you’re recuperating well from your stroke, too… 
We are all sending our thoughts and prayers out to the family at this difficult time . RIP Ryan
My Condolences to all the family and to his children. R.I.P. Ryan O'neal",24,Entertainment,6410000,PT3M24S

#minecraft #secretlife",874,"The fact that I watched Cleo’s POV first and nothing  Grian did struck out of the ordinary other than when Grian asked Etho what he ate for breakfast. I thought that was weird but nothing else until I saw this.
Jimmy somehow manages to weasel his way back in 😭😭😭😭
Out of everyone to be paired together, Jimmy with Grian is the best because now Jimmy can torment Grian freely.
Jimmy and Grian are such brothers I swear! I love seeing them interact and seeing Jimmy get so excited to mess with Grian is always so funny
Etho's task must have been: Jimmy is telling Grian what to do, act as if everything is completely normal
This is honestly such a good representation of Jimmy's quick wit. Every sort of situation Grian was in he managed to find something hilarious for him to do
grian sounded really panicked  as soon as he found out lol 😅
"" the ghosts all stay above the clouds and *watch* ""
whoa, Jimmy, you just created lore.
This is the furthest that Jimmy has ever made it in a Life series. He may not be there in physical form, but he's there in spirit!
I like how Timmy tries to embarrass grian but it backfires.
The absolute sheer joy jimmy had doing this is absolutely making my day
forcing someone to be weird on this server literally has no effect.  People have been weird since day one.  Etho's first episode here was titled ""Server full of weirdos"".
I would love to see a future installment of the Life Series use a gimmick where dead players can stick around as guardian angels for the living players.
When the world needed him the most, he came back
Funny how the secret keeper allowed jimmy back as a ghost instead of letting rejoin in a different name with a mustache just like in the hardcore series grian did with scar and joel 😂😂😂😂😂
Seeing an episode from spectator mode is actually really fun, not to mention this particular task was fantastic
Knowing Etho's strategy has been to do weird things so people couldn't guess his task, he probably just assumed Grian was doing the same thing, on top off Etho just being a chill person in general and not minding other peoples business too much.
""The leaves are all pointing upward.""
*Etho and Cleo appear out of nowhere*
Kinda cute that Jimmy used Grian to woof at Martyn from beyond the grave
Observation. Jimmy spent most of the time just kinda playing around with Grian. but the instant genuine danger gets presented to him, he drops the light tone and warns him
The canary stopped singing to warn him",20,Gaming,1200000,PT24M40S
CA,g8cqWwIwXsc,Sabertooth vs Raptor: Who Would Win?,TierZoo,2023-12-08T17:38:05Z,,626340,75796,"This is the first of a new series I'm calling ""The Anachro-Lab"", an animated series depicting fights between species who normally were separated by millions of years. This pilot episode took two years to produce! The next episode is already underway and will hopefully take a bit less time to create.

A tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
This is an AWESOME turn for the channel! And they don't even always have to be death matches, they could be races to loot or securing an area. Team death matches would be a treat too!
The animation team did a fantastic job! And congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
As an animator myself, Ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew --- theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics. Ive seen hollywood do far worse.

Props all-round -- Super keen to see more of these styles of videos!
As someone who loved watching The Most Extreme as a kid on Animal Planet, I appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly. The only thing missing was the music used in the show.
Dang, the fight choreography was so good! All the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary, but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging. The Cat noticing the raptor, the bluffing, the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor, the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack, and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points.

Such good work!
I didn't realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality... being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content. Incredible work
The animation on this episode is exceptional! Kudos to Kuzim and WobblyWorks!
I've always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a CG character believable, and I'd say this is proof of that
I love this so much!! As a big fan of the iconic ""Animal Face Off"" series back in the day, it's nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback. Awesome stuff as always!
The animations here are crazy cool -- hoping to see more in the future!
This channel has been great the whole time it’s existed, and the skill going into production has been increasing. Thanks for existing!
I'm a long-time fan of Kuzim's art, and it's so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel!
Wow, such a good pilot! This gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on TV, but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe. Congratulations to the whole team.

I just missed your ""gaming guide"" style of writing. This one was professional, succinct and great, but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction.
Sadly I don’t think these videos will hit your normal view count, but please don’t stop making them. The series from this would be amazing and WILL blow up. Great job on the animation from your team.
At first I was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality, fearing they finally dropped the ball on Outside’s legendary graphics. But then I realized this is a user made mod made from scratch. Not bad at all! And a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing! Would love to see more content in this mod.
2 years well spent, this is amazing!! Truly top tier content every single time. TierZoo just doesn't disappoint
The step up in animation is phenomenal! Can't wait to see what you do with it next.
Incredible! Have loved the tier lists for several years now and this brings an exciting new dimension to the channel. Look forward to more of these",27,Education,3650000,PT6M57S

ABOUT WIRED
WIRED is where tomorrow is realized. Through thought-provoking stories and videos, WIRED explores the future of business, innovation, and culture.",931,"Thanks again, Wired. More collabs in 2024? 👀
Playing against Stockfish is like competing in arm wrestling against an industrial press, basically.
Stockfish never fails to put Levy in a video
This guy should make his own YouTube channel about chess
Stockfish be like: You missed mate in 54? You filthy casual, my suggested move is to never play chess again.
It took him 34 moves to lose to Stockfish? I could do it much faster than that.
@GothamChess @Wired - thank you for having me on to talk about computer chess!  It's been one of my passions for a long time, and it was so much fun to discuss with you.
So basically the answer to every single question is that Stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol
I know he is an IM, but surviving 35 moves against Stockfish is seriously impressive. I wish I can survive 35 against my 1000 elo opponents.
I love how GMs don't even get on this. All the less incentive to be one when you're more influential than most GMs. Props Gotham
Just wait until they hear about Mittens
I don't even see the opponents bishop on the opposite side of the diagonal, let alone seeing 2-3 moves into the future
Levy: [builds a YouTube career roasting 500 rated bozos]
Stockfish: [exists]
Levy: ""Turns out the bozo was me all along""

Loving the Gotham<>WIRED collabs!
I love when Levy appears in a video he didn't upload because the title and thumbnail actually tells you what to expect.
This video is so good on so many levels. It's one thing to discuss the capability of a computer. It's another thing to be able explain to the common person why this computer is so good and to make the whole explanation so interesting. Add Levy's humor and his ability to explain things very well, mix that with all that the Wired editorial staff can bring to the table, and it's just wow. This content is just friggin awesome. Thanks, all involved!
Human: *performs opening move*

Stockfish: “after considering half a billion possibilities in a million different realities, I will play knight to F6 🤓”
To think, there was a time when we thought it would be impossible to ever teach a computer to play chess competitively against people.  Until Deep Blue beat the best of us.
The fact Alpha Zero made Stockfish look silly after only 4 hours of learning chess by playing against itself is both fascinating and scary at the same time.
Levy's so good they can bring him on to interview someone else and the video is still awesome.
as someone who's very interested in the world of machine learning (and has looked into how stockfish works), its cool seeing a video covering the fundamental concepts like this. i hope we get more videos like this",24,Entertainment,10800000,PT9M54S

Asake thanks for sticking to your style and language 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
The only problem with this song is that it ends😊
If you are here in 2090, I was here in 2023
Asake was a young artist who came from GRASS to
GRACE. He was among the best musicians of his generation & he was a living LEGEND.
In 2023, Nigerian music was doing absolutely well, getting even better everyday and it was loved worldwide. We Nigerians we're proud of this success story.
Hope the world is a better place in 2090? Stay safe and be a nice human.
Wow!! I did even expect Gunna would follow up the beat with his own verse 😊
When talent is at its best no one can stop it....... big up 🎉😊❤......to everyone watching this masterpiece.........much love from Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Let’s not forget to also appreciate the producers! They are the architects behind these great songs ❤️
As a music producer deeply immersed in the rich tapestry of African rhythms, I extend heartfelt gratitude to the Nigerian music community for their instrumental role in propelling Amapiano, the vibrant South African genre, to remarkable heights. This collaboration is a monumental stride for African music on the global stage.

Amapiano, with its unique blend of deep house, jazz, and lounge music infused with luscious piano melodies and low-tempo beats, has found a resonant harmony within the Nigerian music scene. This synergy has not only enriched the genre’s texture but also expanded its reach and influence, affirming the power of African musical heritage in shaping global soundscapes.

This cross-cultural fusion exemplifies the dynamic, ever-evolving nature of African music and underscores the continent’s collective potential in forging new frontiers in the global music industry. As we witness Amapiano’s ascent, it’s a testament to the unifying power of music and the endless possibilities that emerge when diverse African musical traditions converge and collaborate.
Purest video I’ve seen in a while. No fake cash, no yansh. JUST HAPPINESS 🎉
I love how blacks literally support each other to grow and be a burst of sunshine AGAIN! Oh, mama Africa... I can't wait to see you prosper and well, Africa!

Much love & respect to him. 
I'm really happy to this collaboration 4real!!!!
ON REPEAT!!! A song that warms my heart…much needed!!
The vibes, the aesthetic, the beat, and the melody were all on point. Great song. Asake killed it.
I’m just so happy for Asake and Sarz, it’s time the world enjoyed your talents

Merci Vilbrequin
Ne pleurez pas parce que c'est fini.. souriez parce que c'est arrivé !
Merci les gars, vous avez été géniaux sur ces 5 ans. Longue vie à vos carrières respectives ;)
D'ailleurs, je peux le dire maintenant...




J'ai adoré le format CA FAIT QUOI ♥

Just realized Paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady.  She’s basically a drone.
I just hope furina gets the well deserved hug. That she didn't receive.
Would be so cool if Navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  😭
Furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished. Love that for her.
Rip Meluse and Silver. Went out as heroes even beyond the grave. Rest well. 🫡
Teleporting right to the ""key"" in domains is going to be a MASSIVE time saver. I can't even count how many hundreds of times I did the sprint along the entrance stairs.
I love it when Sarah hosts the special programs.
Fontaine enabling a non-hydro related reaction with Chevreuse is really an unexpected move
You know historically both France and Japan have had influence each other in some point in time (especially artistically), so seeing Inazuma chars in Fontaine, doesn't surprise me in the least lol.

This patch for TCG is the closest we'll get to Signora being a playable character.
Thank you dev team for all those system optimizations! We appreciate you! 🙌✨
I’m smiling for this Genshin baby!
Damn Furina’s PTSD kicking in with the word ‘wave’ is so on point, and I love how she is happy now.
Furina being a director!?? Cries she seems so happy!!!!!! I love her it's so grest she gets to do what she loves and be free now. And the film event looks AMAZING!!! litterly looks like the MOSTFUN version EVER!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Out of all the news shared, I’m definitely hyped that we finally get to grace our ears with Wanderer’s theme with Stellar Moments Vol.4 outside of his character demo and covers.
I love the enthusiasm the voice actors bring to the show (and the game!). Must be really fun to work in a project like this 😌
Zhongli skin at the end of the special program is 🤩🤩🤩. I wish the team make it available for us.",20,Gaming,7120000,PT39M46S

I am absolutely certain that if 1% of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did, regardless of what that may be, to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place.
Thank you James for encouraging people, through coffee, to do more, do better and question what they do.
The reason you're not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process. No idea the details of how the machine works, but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains.
It’s fascinating that the spritzing makes a MEASURABLE difference to the extraction of the espresso. I could totally see “well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality it’ll probably never mean anything,” but it’s amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful, quantitative change.
I love the citizen science your channel is promoting, and that you're encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared. There is a signal here, we just can't see it yet. Keep sharing, keep signal boosting, and keep experimenting!
If you close your eyes you can experience what it’s like to have Jon Hamm describe coffee physics to you
I think when collecting data from lots of people, tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important. I keep my house really dry (~30%) for 3D printing, and I see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder, which doesn’t have any bottleneck. So RH may be a significant source of noise.
I’m not sure why the links aren’t showing for some people. Here they are:

It’s always a pleasure to watch these videos. And even more of a pleasure to watch James slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
Decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago.  Somehow forgot that I’d since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat.  While I can’t endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder, it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real Proustian moment while I played “what the hell is that weird perfume flavor?”
My suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed, which usually I would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry. The oils in the coffee also probably don't help with that. If you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil, you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference. So a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming, leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates. This is not contrary to what the prof said. It might be a combination of both.
Even though I'm not ""that into"" coffee and usually just guess each time I make it, I absolutely love your videos. It's not just the information, but the candor, the dedication without obsession, and the curiosity. I wish there were clones of you making YouTube videos on different topics - it'd be a better world.
This is fascinating!  There's a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee.  I've been freezing beans for freshness since I use coffee pretty slowly.  An unintended result is that when I take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind, pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold.  It's like getting a mist and mix for no effort.  Hard to control the amount (which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room), but interesting nonetheless.  I've also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my Breville Barista Express or my Fellow Ode gen 1, and not surprisingly I've had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders.
Man, this video is surreal. I don't think I ever had a chance to meet him specifically, but I was just at a small conference with Chris Hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research. I don't think I've ever seen someone I've encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this. I suspected that he or his work about coffee (though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry) would show up here eventually though. Super exciting stuff!
I am SUPER excited that you got a particle size analyzer, and from a legit analytical science company like Anton Paar. That is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders, burrs, grind RPM, etc, which so far has been limited to assumptions. Wow! That instrument is a significant investment too and I'm thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune, so to speak, can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere!

I'm assuming we'll be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument. Can't wait =)
I used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published. My grinder is the new Fellow Opus. It was the first time I did it with the Opus because I never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech. And I was so surprised that when wet, it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when it’s dry. Now that this paper has been published, I’m going to try it again!
James, I would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from, particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind. My theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators. I think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders -- the Eureka Mignon Oro has a metal spout and cup.
I just tried spritzing for pour over coffee. There was less static cling, which was nice. I also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower. I only did it once so it could be a fluke.
Well done Chris and his fellow authors as well as you James. What shocks me is that there isn't more science on how to improve the taste of coffee. Probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively. But there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques.
Just a simple thank you James for all you do. Endlessly fascinating to me, and rewarding every time I make my coffee.",24,Entertainment,1930000,PT19M37S

I love you 

Et si je te dis que je t’aime 
tu dois me répondre que tu m’aimes 
c’est tellement simple un peu comme 1+1 font deux
et si tu me dis que tu m’aimes 
je te répondrai que je t’aime 
je prends ta main, je ferme les yeux et je me sens mieux 

oh baby i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
oh baby i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)

je vais casser toutes mes montres peu importe ce que ca va me coûter oh 
quand j’aime le temps doit pas s'écouler oh 
et depuis que toi c’est moi 
j’ai tout oublié du passé oh (ma chérie)
dis moi où tu t’étais cachée oh 

oh pourquoi j’ai mal (mal)
pourquoi je suis blessé oh 
j’ai demandé à Dieu de nous séparer mais il n’veut pas m’éxaucer oh 
oh c’est lui qui sait et son plan est déjà calé oh 
donc si c’est pour toi c’est avec la joie que je vais pleurer oh 

Et si je te dis que je t’aime 
tu dois me répondre que tu m’aimes 
c’est tellement simple un peu comme 1+1 font deux 
et si tu me dis que tu m’aimes 
je te répondrai que je t’aime

i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
oh baby i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
i love i love i love i love i love you 

et si la foudre frappe une seconde 
l’amour lui n’peut pas finir 
laisse moi guérir de tous tes bobos ma chérie
je n’peux plus souffrir 
souffrance même cherche à te fuire 
écoute ma poitrine mon coeur à des choses à te dire 

allez donne tes larmes, oh donne tes cris 
tout ce qu’ils t’ont fait on va oublier 
prends moi cadeau, fais moi oublier mon goumin 
allez prends moi tout, garde le pour toi 
et si le ciel me rappelle c’est devant toi que je veux fermer les yeux 

oh baby i love i love i love i love i love you (i love you beaucoup)
i love i love i love i love i love you 
oh baby i love i love i love i love i love you 
i love i love i love i love i love you

I lost my wife earlier this year. She would have loved this song. I shed tears of somberness and loneliness this Christmas. Thank you for releasing this song Simon.
XG is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained & honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly.
What an instant bop for this season!
XG brings soul back in music. They sing with their heart. Every word they say, every note they sing, every choreo, there are soulful sincere message in it. I hope they keep on doing what they doing. They are making the right choice. There are a lot of us who understand real music, talented artists. We’ve been waiting for a group like you our whole life. The fanbase keeps getting bigger. I saw new reactors everyday. They been saying you are their favorite group. So.. keep going! XG HESONO OOOOO!!!!
They really need to play this on radio in all over the US.
My great grandpa passed away in October. Its been really hard for me, and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this Christmas. Thanks, XG, for your amazing new song. 🖤
I wish XG would release a full length album with 13-14 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts🙏🤞
The gals need some radio play for this song.. it’s such a good song and deserves more people to know before Christmas
Toda vez que escuto novamente, meu coração vibra de uma maneira diferente! OBRIGADA XG 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I lost my mom this year. This song made me think of her since she loved Christmas ❤
The more i listened to the song the more it hit harder. Also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated Christmas for so long. Because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that. This song was so meaningful, thank you XG, XGALX, the creators behind it so much. For making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young 🩵🤍❄️ And yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 🩵🩵🩵
こんなに奮い立たせるような冬ソングは今まであっただろうか…

全員がエモい。誰を推すとかじゃなくて、全員ステキすぎる
It's sad how underrated this group is.
They slayed every genre..
Not only noisy music and dances
Coco's voice so warm and smooth,  I can listen to her forever. 
Juria's make me emotional.
Maya's and Hinata's voices are so pretty. I'm happy they did a lot of singing here.
Chisa always killing it.
Jurin's and Harvey's parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time.

Love them sooo sooo much
I really want to meet the person who produces/writes their stuff. It is SO authentically American 90s to early 2000s R&B it's crazy!!! Kpop often chases black culture awkwardly, but these girls TRULY pay so much hommage to it in SUCH an authentic way!! It's so amazingly beautiful! Also, Harvey...that outfit at 3:33 - I can't, girl stop...please, my heart 😍😍😍
The beauty of the song, the amazing vocals, the rap production, the beautiful harmonies, everything is perfect.
This song deserves more attention, Xg is such a talented group they’re better than the most of popular groups.
XG is slowly dominating the world. Really hoping for a live performance.
That melody is angelic OMG ✨. Maya’s part surprised me in such a good way, I love that I discover new talents from the members with every new release.",10,Music,2400000,PT4M11S

We're all sad that you left the private lifesteal smp, but we are all happy to see you still thrive in other sectors and most importantly, in the public lifesteal server! I've always loved your videos and their unique style(ofc with a bit of rekrap charm), and  I'll keep watching them no matter what!!! ❤
Im so glad a project youve poured your heart in is finally active, it is so fun to see<3
Im rewatching echocraft and it seems rek has always been this good

Rekrap: Immediately attempts to block glitch.
MANNN THAT WAS SO FUN! Your base looks so cool, I really hope no one finds it from this video that'd be unfortunate XD
Very cool video, fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one!
@rekrap2 Just wanted to let you know: since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the ""target block"" and ""target fluid"" on the bottom right since they show exact coords.
@rekrap2 Just letting you know, if you want to properly blur your coordinates, you also need to blur the ""chunk coordinates"" Which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks... Edit: After trying to figure out if you gave info away, I have found that you did block it. Sorry.
Seeing Rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
Hey Rek, it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown over the past couple of years form EcoCraft to Life-steal then the race to 1M with parrot then to commentary, speed runs, Hoplite and so much other amazing content. Thank you so much for entertaining me over the years.
I'm so happy that you made this video. I enjoy watching these types of  thanks Rek keep up the good work !
Watching secret life has made me extra anxious watching anyone playing on a server. I especially skipped a beat when the meteor dropped on your head lol
Edit: This was a really fun video
You HAVE TO make this a series, it’s soo good!
I can't wait to see more of this, looks super cool. Would like to play, but starting late is rough
This was really fun to watch. Those POI and the unique mechanics were great.
Oh my god this is so much fun!! I can’t wait to see what else will come in this series.
Rek never disappoints us and can always bring us amazing and fantastic content!
Seeing individuals enjoying themselves with their favorite creators is amazing.
It's wonderful to see people having fun with their favorite creators.",20,Gaming,1570000,PT17M24S

Never happened before in the history of music and likely won't happen again.  Congratulations to Brenda and Johnny Marks, the gentleman who wrote the song all those years ago.
Wow she still has it !! 
And at 78 right?  We should all be so lucky !
Sounded FABULOUS Brenda Lee!! Loved it!🎄
she deserves it so much!!! Having a song 65 years later that is such an iconic christmas must have on your playlist song hit the #1 spot again, is amazing!!
Love this! Brenda has more spunk and vitality than some singers half her age. So refreshing.
That is exactly the same way she sang that song back in 1958!
I was 6 years old when this song was a hit. I'm 71 now looking at spry and beautiful Brenda Lee belting this song out like she did in 1958. It's bringing me to tears to see her looking so wonderful. God bless you Brenda and keep rockin' around that Christmas tree for years to come!
Su voz es increíble 😳🥰
WE LOVE YOU BRENDA. ❤❤❤ WHAT AN ICON. 🤩🤩🤩
She’s still got it. I’m a 15 year old boy and love all of her music! So glad she’s getting the respect she deserves, even in her older years. Not to mention, she didn’t even lip-sync!!! And autotune, couldn’t even hear it. This is how it’s done.
Good lord if this don’t put a smile on your face, nothing will!  Merry Christmas, Brenda Lee and congratulations on your Billboard #1 single !
A heartwarming moment! Everybody is happy for Brenda's success. You can see it in their faces. She was a tiny premature girl born in a charity ward who became a worldwide success. A remarkable story really.
She is AMAZING her voice hasn't changed one bit. One of my favorite Christmas songs
her voice is  still pure dynamite ! One of the most versatile artist ever! Love from Austria!
She makes me smile from ear to ear
She's been singing this song for more than 60 years... and she still looks like she's having a blast doing it. We could all only wish we have that much energy and passion left at that age.
I am so happy for Brenda Lee! 65 years later, and her song hits #1 in America. You go, girl!
She's still got it after all these years 🙂
This is so cool for so many reasons! Great to see her get the respect she deserves while still with us.
Wow, what a treasure! She sounds just as great as the original recording!
BRENDA LEE is indestructible.  She can still ROCK the stage!!
She’s nailed it. Wonderful performance",24,Entertainment,1060000,PT2M22S

©CAPCOM CO., LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",5776,"Hunters, take care of yourselves so we all make it to 2025 and play this amazing game together!
New ecosystems, new creatures, a mount that let's you glide from high falls, everything from this trailer brought me joy and I absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar.
SO EXCITED!!!  (づ｡◕‿◕｡)づ⭐
This is what I always wanted to see in monster hunter. Large flocks of animals, more ambiant mega-fauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs.

It will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem, can't wait to see what they cook up for us.
As a fiver, it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of Monster Hunter. I am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
""I'll let it speak for itself"" is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement, you know that Monster Hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds.
The amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster (and Rath ofc) is actually stunning to me. Didn't think they had it in them.
Seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment, as well as one another, has got me feeling the same giddiness I had seeing the Monster Hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time. This franchise is in my blood man!
One of my friends got me into MH back when World was announced. I played World/Iceborne and Rise/Sunbreak. 3000+ hours combined later, this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time. Here’s to hunting with everyone in 2025, let’s go!
Here's the most anticipated game for me until it comes out. Very hard to top it from my list. 
MHW have such a special place in my gamer heart.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING! It gives me very open worldish vibes! I would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting, exploring, and researching kinda vibe.
The little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic.
From that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in. The synth stuff being used is really new to MH or at least it hasn't had a very large presence. They mainly kept to orchestration.

But all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme.

Truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack.
MHW was my first introductory into the franchise. It became and still remains my favorite game ever. and I started at the base Nintendo system. This game just brought joy to my heart.
Love the little bit they showed here, the movement feels like a mix of Worlds more Methodical speed and Rises more open verticallity
I absolutely loved World's ecosystem simulation, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game!
I thought you couldn't get better than the Palamutes... I was so wrong. Though the mount's different movement types kinda make me think of Koraidon and Miraidon- the Pokemon mounts from Scarlet and Violet. It's a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great. I love this creature and I want twelve of them.
Bro, when I was going into the Game Awards, I had the lowest of low expectations…but then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interested…and then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me. I am hyped beyond belief, even if 2025 is quite a long wait, I am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon!
I want them to bring back 16 person hubs. So much more lively for my 7-12 person groups. It felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world.
One of my friends got me into monster hunter. My first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since. Cant wait to see what the new game brings ❤
I'm reaching that phase in my life where i really don't feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thought...so damn excited :)",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S

Which characters are you hoping to see on the roster?
Who else is ready for one of the biggest and best fighting experiences to date?! RIP all controllers
Its like the fusion of DBZ Kakarot and DBFZ in terms of animation.  This is gonna be 🔥
Please I hope we get a huge roster like the old games and they don’t lock a bunch of them behind paywalls
It's absolutely crucial to feature local multiplayer. For a fighting game, not having this is a deal breaker for many people, myself included. I have so many great couch memories with the old Tenkaichi 2 and 3 split screen battles - please make it happen!
I’ve played Budokai Tenkaichi literally most of my life and NOW WERE FINALLY GETTING ANOTHER ONE. WE ARE SO BACK
Don't lock characters behind DLC and pay walls,let us unlock the roster!
I'm hoping they'll have a lot of OG DB characters on the roster. Would love to play as Piccolo Jr. or Kid Goku from the Path to Power movie.
I find myself constantly rewatching this trailer in disbelief that a new budokai tenakichi is being made it’s crazy. I still have play bt3 and rb2 to this day and a another is actually being made it’s soo surreal man thank god i lived to see this
no wonder why they took so long... they wanted to make sure they did it RIGHT 🔥🔥 Incredible
No words can express
How much I been waiting for a entry in the budokai series in a very long time! Without this series I wouldn’t have been a fan of dragon ball z or anime in general!
I've genuinely done nothing but cry this past 2 days

I just can't stop thinking about this, being alive to experience tenkaichi's return and it being so glorious
I've been watching this trailer at least twice a day since it was announced. It's amazing, and I hope it's well worth the wait!
This trailer showed me almost everything I need to know about the game play to be excited, but please don't forget one of the things that made Tenkaichi special was the uniquely cinematic character intros and the roster that included faces even harcore fans occasionally forget. 

Seeing Bergamo helped, but I would love to see this roster include more Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT characters like Jackie chun, King Chappa, Ledgic and Goku Jr.
I really hope they go ALL OUT on this for roster. Tenkaichi 3 was so crazy. I want everyone from the Pilaf Gang and Grandpa Gohan to Meta Rildo and Orange Piccolo. If the character has thrown a punch, I want them in
Better have a Hercule with infinite combo like in Budokai Tenkaichi 2
Also 1-2 Arcade mode like in 2 or 3 would be awesome! 🥰
Quase chorei ao ver esse trailer, jogo perfeitamente lindo, doido pra partir o controle jogando ele kkk
I already lost count on how many times I’ve watched this, its perfect.
Definitely gonna save up so i can buy it as soon as the preorder is available.
After waiting for 15 years we finally have the definitive sequel to this legendary series. Thank you Bandai.",20,Gaming,1090000,PT1M4S

#FF7R #PS5",3158,"This game is gonna make me shed so many tears and I am so here for it!!! Cant wait for February already!!! who else pre-ordered?
God, that last shot of Aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds.
Cid's voice sounds great! Can't wait to see more of him in this game
The thing I'm looking forward to the most is the Dyne plot line. It seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around, and barret was already so good in Remake.
This game is literally the only reason I’m going to buy a ps5. In the original, Midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game. I can’t wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror.
Aerith's new white dress is so pretty! Did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral?
So excited for this game!!!
Props to Loren Alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game. truly magnificent ❤❤🤩
So niceeeeee!! Cid and Vincent in the party, Cloud and Aerith, Barret's story...the Gold Saucer!!! and Marlene there with Cloud and Zack, so insane!! looking forward to playing the second part!
Im emotional already... who knew the impact and trauma FFVII would cause a whole generation
Cid was one of my favorite characters in the original FF7, can't wait to play as him again in this remake.
I love Aerith so much, I teared up. Beautiful song ❤
I love Dyne's voice. Well, everyone looks amazing!
Oh my gosh, Cloud and Aerith just two inches away from each other ❤❤❤❤
I still have Phantom Pain from 26 years ago..... That last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th Time
This is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers.  And I don't think it's going to end the way we suspect.  It won't be smiles and rainbows, but I don't think Aerith is going to die, either.  If she did, then it would beg the question of what this was all for.  We know this isn't a true remake, but a sequel to the original game.  (The true remake is Ever Crisis.)
Quite possibly the greatest game ever made
I nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer... I'm not ready for this, I just want to see these characters I grew up with have a happy ending. But I know the journey of Rebirth won't be an easy one... Final Fantasy for Life!
Nobuo Uematsu is truly a legend. He just knows how to make music fit the themes of Final Fantasy games so well. Can't have Final Fantasy without Nobuo you just can't. This song may possibly be the signature theme of FFVII games from now on. The ending for FF VII is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this. I'm looking forward to when that day comes.
Just when I thought my hype couldn't get any bigger! I haven't even played this game yet and I can already tell it's going to be one of my favorite games of all time.
One of my favorite trailers ever this is gonna be a masterpiece",20,Gaming,172000,PT2M37S

Beautiful graciousness from a gorgeous woman who will be a Queen to help take the nation into the future.
Long life to our king and the entire royal family
Classy and elegant.  I hope she never changes!  We need more female role models like her in this world.
The Wales  showing the world the true meaning of a happy loving family. Merry Christmas and at Blessed 2024
Such an Adorable Family and Catherine is the epitome of Elegance !!!!😊
She is just marvelous.
Me encanta la princesa es tan dulce tan natural sin poses de protagonismo tiene una familia muy bella
She does her job so well. And her family are so beautiful.  May they always be healthy and happy.
I just admire the Royal Family 
The way Princess Catherine and Prince William and they children treat toward other it is amazing
I love how when speaking to kids, she literally gets down to their level. Magnificent ❤
My goodness, just glorious! White is the perfect color choice and the feeling is so cozy and festive. Such a beautiful family too - Prince George is so grown up! Merry Christmas to the RF from the USA. 💗💗💗
What a lovely family!  I'm so glad Prince Louis got to join in the fun this year!  How cute to see the three of them post their letters to Santa.  I hope they all have a very Happy Christmas!
Catherine is so charming and actually engages with people, unlike you know who.
The Princess of Wales is the jewel in our crown for the British, absolutely stunning, and she has the most beautiful personality.  So proud she represents this country, her genuine warmth and interest in people shows what a true empath she is, and William is the same. Presidents and country rulers come and go, but the RF is unique and so are our traditions.
Wow she can work a crowd.  That isn’t easy and she does it with sincerely and ease.
I love her interaction with children.
Such a warm human being radiating love and happiness - bringing people together, not shouting and hating like others we know.   Catherine is simply beautiful.
❤ Princess Katherine takes her time to greet everyone! She speaks to everyone with such kindness and sincerity! You can not fake that! She is a wonderful person and it shows!
Princess Catherine is the epitome of beauty, grace, dignity and kindness. I’m from Poland and here we love her too! I wish her and her family all the best! Be strong and proud Catherine - regardless the attacks of spitful, bitter and jealous people. They are small, and you’re the future queen :) Greetings from Warsaw!",25,News & Politics,3330000,PT2M34S

God bless India 🇮🇳
I just came to India... just watched animal.. and now I cannot stop dancing to this song <3 anyone has the lyrics to it?
It's not a audio it's a addiction ❤️✨
Who loved Bobby in abrar's role❤
Those who went for the movie they only know how this scene is iconic
I am Iranian and I also enjoy Indian songs very much. I believe that our mutual love for each other's songs is not a coincidence, as there are many similarities and shared values in Indian and Iranian culture and language.
It might be the first time in any movie history that viewers enjoyed the entry of a villian more than a hero 🇮🇷💓🇮🇳
As a native Persian ( Farsi ) speaker , I can't describe my feeling of joy after seeing bobby's entry with this song...!
As an Iranian I really appreciate choosing this nostalgic song of our culture 
God bless India 
I'm from Afghanistan 🇦🇫 and I'm happy to hear this song in an Indian film.
Love Iran 🇮🇷 and India 🇮🇳
MARCANDO PRESENÇA NESSE MOMENTO HISTÓRICO
Honestly I am so happy for Bobby and Ranbir. They both deserved a big hit. Awesome actors.
As an Iranian(Persian), i'm really happy this song appeard on the Bollywood! 
I remember this song as a child in every Iranian wedding I have attended. Glad to see it hits in a dance loving culture such as India.
*A message to the future generations..Don’t let this masterpiece song die..*
As an Iranian I really appreciate choosing this
nostalgic song of our culture.
God bless all
Sandeep Reddy Vanga's music selection is truly praiseworthy, seamlessly weaving emotions into his films through a captivating blend of melodies. Each song is a testament to his excellent taste and ability to enhance storytelling through music.
Hugs from India to my sweet Iranian people for this song May Allah bring peace and happiness to my Iranian brothers and sisters! ~ Love 

Legendary.
Tyler and Bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots. They endured siting/standing in a wall and floor for 3 hours.
JT fan favourite? The insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though, especially when James said how disgusting that would be. Like what's coming next year, hiding in the septic tank?
JT hiding in plain sight was awesome
Funniest has to be JT and Andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while James goofed around with his card trick, but Tyler and Bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure. Hard to pick between the 2 though
Wow! Lots of good hiding spots this year!

It's be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in...
Honestly, Tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all. Bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening, but Tyler's had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile.
I’m surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid. I was most impressed with JT hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently.
Someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year.
If the Hacksmith Industries ever move to another building, the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property.
The insulation hiding spot was 200iq. When James pulled out the thermal camera, I thought “he is not going to find that person with the camera”.
I love how much team work they put in, and I love how often James walked past some people in plain sight lol
JT hiding was the best I've ever seen. Dude was just sitting there like nobody's business while James was running around. Legendary.
I really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building. This is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever.
JT's hiding spot deserves commendation, James was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
This looks like so much fun! Despite the high-pressure work environment and the demands of producing YouTube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech, y'all still manage to bring your A game to hide-and-seek. Great job!
JT hiding right in front James at the desk was by far the best, even though he got caught eventually.
I feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead... build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings...
If I had a nickel for every time I saw a YouTube based company playing hide and seek with their employees, I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened right
JT keeping his cool with James leaning over his shoulder was _absolutely_ the best! That said, Tyler's hole in the floor was prolly the most effective spot.",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT21M1S

#GlobalNews #canada #cdnpoli",2158,"maybe they should do the same with immigration. I don't understand how we will support the influx of 500k per year when there is already a lack of housing, health care..etc. for Canadians.
“It would be a mistake to blame international students for the housing crisis”. You got that right. You, the government, are to blame not international students.
I cannot understand why our  government has more concern and compassion  and wanting the international  students to thrive  then their own citizens.  Going forward lets start offer solutions  so  canadian citizens   thrive and just not  survive.
They need to bring their own support here. The tax payers can’t be held liable to support immigrants. The money needs to be going to our Canadian veterans and families in need. The colleges are making an obscene amount of money from international students and they can provide them with the knowledge on how to get on in Canada, they are literally an education institution.
“So we can ensure international students are set up for success in Canada”

What are you doing to ensure canadians are set up for success in canada? Our leaders are a joke on both sides of the aisle.
So you’re gonna find affordable housing for international students but keep ignoring the problem for Canadians?
Canada have to invest and support its own Canadian citizen students , not in foreign student.
It feels like the government cares more about International Students than Canadians who have lived here their entire lives.
“Enough is enough!  We are tired of our own policies ruining our country!”  - Liberal Government
I immigrated to Canada via being international students then work then immigrate. Let me tell you, it’s not an easy route and it has a lot of limitations. I took a ton of coop to ensure I will have good job opportunity when I graduate. I also spent more than 100k in tuition alone. I’m grateful for this path and privilege. It’s disgusting to see some international students scamming the system and going to food banks! The purpose of international students is to boost our economy, better our university equipment and staff. It’s not to burden the society. When I applied decades ago, I couldn’t work more than 20 hours, I have to renew my permit every year or two. Prove I have enrolled in full time school, show them my grade and sufficient financial support. They expect you to have at least 10k in cash sitting around untouched. 

How d f we got to this point?! Why would we even have international student going to food back?! Send them home if they can’t afford! I’ve done it, it’s a privilege not right.
International students are coming for the betterment of themselves. They are taking the jobs that our homeless and youth should be getting. Now we hear of forien students going to food banks to provide more for themselves and it's free. Canada should not be responsible for delivering proper education for international students while our own need assistance.
I like how he says he wants international students to thrive but never mentions Canadians hahaha
Universities are meant for the majority of Canadian kids.  It’s ridiculous that in some Universities overseas student get class preference just because they pay more in fees.  It’s not right or fair that Canadian children/ young adults are missing out on class spaces due to this.  What are provincial governments doing about this? 😡
As a student, I was offered inadequate living conditions at inflated prices (and I am not an international student, I am from here).
Our social security nets should not be able to be accessed by foreigners. 

They should be for our citizens only.
The Canadian government is making a big mistake by giving so many student visas (hundreds of thousands). The short gain in tuition fees will be paid by the next generations of Canadian citizens. The reality is that all these foreign students, the majority from India, are using the visas to become residents of Canada. When they take the jobs of Canadians, and they bring more of their relatives, it will be too late to close the door. Immigration should be regulated, gradual and selective.
Canadian students born in Canada can barely afford their living costs and tuition and none cares, but the government is more concerned about international students before their own, its truly sad.
One thing to consider, if some people have not realized yet, is that the largest Canadian colleges (not universities) are essentially diploma mills that bring in hundreds of thousands of international students into the country each year. A lot of these 1-to-2-year college diplomas are just a piece of paper, with many classes consisting of 75%+ international students. As a second-generation immigrant, I favor halting fraudulent ""student visas"" which some politicians have suggested. The cost of giving oligarchs their much loved cheap labor to work under horrible conditions is a price everyone is paying dearly for. It lowers salaries across the board, makes standard work conditions worse, and promotes fraud, all because these desperate, entitled people, sometimes lying on their application and pretending to be students, will accept anything to stay or become PRs. International students may pay taxes and subsidize domestic tuition but the broader long term economic implications they have is contributing to the crises we're experiencing in this country. Rising cost of living, severe lack of affordable housing, overcrowded healthcare, etc.. And you wonder why people aren't having children. If we're going to allow more immigrants, we need more skilled labour or people who will study something useful, and who will actually integrate with the rest of Canadian society. Leaders and politicians are just as much to blame if not more.
Agreed 💯. Very well said. It's time to put a cap on the number of students coming in Canada. If the country doesn't have enough housing then they should limit the students to come. This is the reason why landlords are increasing rents due to high demands.
No international students until our own people are ALL housed. This is insane.",25,News & Politics,3970000,PT1M37S

Sales from merch will support all life members who opted in.",2915,"""The leaves are all pointing upwards"" is a killer quote
Etho unknowingly roasting Jimmy while he's listening is just pure comedic perfection. XD
the cutoff immediately when Martin says ""When is that ender pearl gonna-"" is golden
I think Jimmy confused ""Guardian Angel"" with ""Intrusive Thoughts Personified""
Joel's ""For the Bad Boys"" hurts way more when you consider that he didn't know Jimmy was there. It was like a moment of them all working together again in a weird little way. My heart.
Grian, Cleo and Etho are like the most wholesome trio that Grian had in the entire life series hhahahaha i love it. Doing that zombie dance without hesitation hahaha
I love how ""The leaves are all pointing upwards."" somehow manages to sound so menacing, even though it means absolutely nothing.
gem's little ""yes!"" when they said the berry bushes got them was so cute. The reds this season aren't even scary, they're adorable
Etho and Cleo simply not reacting to Grians stranger-than-normal behaviour is so based. They got this.
what i've realized from this video is that Jimmy has a brain made for content. Like the amount of things he did that made this video so many levels of entertaining is genius.
them having tasks for the people who died early so they still have fun/content is actually so cute
I’m super appreciative of the fact that the captions in this video are different colors depending on who is talking. Thank you!!
Now I _kinda_ wanna see an SMP where everyone has a secret spectator buddy
Etho and Cleo listening to Grians weird requests and not thinking or asking twice before doing them for him... perfect.
JIMMY’S REACTION TO ETHO’S CASUAL REACTION TO “IT’SA ME” WAS SO FUNNY
Timmy is forgetting that everyone just embraces the weirdness in this series after 8 episodes
The curse of Timmy is contagious. He guides Grian and Grian loses so many hearts, turns red and loses even more hearts!
Crazy how I watched 11 other perspectives and didn't think for a minute that Grian was acting weird
The “for the bad boys” was timed real well with the fact that Timmy is guiding Grian
Ghosts coming back to give information would be very cool for the next series. Being attached to a specific player when you die to haunt them or guard them would be amazing.",20,Gaming,8360000,PT32M51S

The test achieved a number of major milestones, helping us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary. The team at Starbase is already working final preparations on the vehicles slated for use in Starship’s third flight test. 

Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting second flight test of Starship!

Follow us on X.com/SpaceX for continued updates on Starship's progress",2435,"We need these streams back on YouTube, I need to see this on a large display.
So great seeing all 33 Raptor engines staying lit during the entire Stage 1 ascent, excellent work!
I REALLY hope you start showing the Spacex launches on YouTube again, their are many many people who don't do social media and miss watching all the Falcon launches and updates.
Great work to all at Spacex as always.
Excited to see SpaceX making history in our lifetimes(:
I’m 67, and I remember the space program from Mercury through Apollo. They used to wheel a TV into the classrooms so we could watch…you can’t imagine how thrilled I am to see this happening! SpaceX is just running away with the ball, so happy for everyone on the project 🙌
I love this!
Please bring back live launches to YouTube, or make a smart TV app for X so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone.
This is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and co-operation, long live the entire team at SpaceX! 👏
The length of the flame plume is completely insane. Starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building, but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height, the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
It looks almost like an animation, the performance of those 33 Raptor engines was flawless 😊
It was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life. Thank you SpaceX team!
1:06 The shutdown of the engines, in a ring, from the outside to the inside!! Pure exhibitionism from Spacex!! A true spectacle!!
Inspiring, Mom always told me “shoot for the stars because you’ll land on the moon” I always think about it when I look up, Thank you guys for always pushing yourselves, it reminds me to do the same
It's amazing how close the shot at 0:53 looks to prior renders of Starship, both by SpaceX and by fans
The way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome! Well done SpaceX.
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the SpaceX team! <3
Go for it!
This gave me goosebumps! I feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future! Thankyou SpaceX ❤
Impressive epic view of liftoff. The visuals from SpaceX have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech.   Looks like SpaceX is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles!
Compared to the first test flight, this one was like night and day. Bravo, SpaceX crew! IFT 3
Это было потрясающе! Ждём с нетерпением тест 3!
The emotion of being able to watch and follow the entire preparation and launch of Starship is something spectacular, wonderful, unique, with all my heart, congratulations to everyone involved in this incredible mission, unsurpassable SpaceX...",28,Science & Technology,6600000,PT1M55S

You can proper see how genuine their friendship is when Chunks is hitting himself in the head with the white board and Filly goes ""AHH!! ok that's enough brother"" like he felt the pain..... sounds cheesy writing it, I know but its beautiful to see such genuine people on our screens now a days so I have to mention it. xx

The universe is going to die one day, and a fight between two titans will decide our cosmic fate.
On one side of this galactic battlefield, we have all the matter in the universe; on the other side, empty space infused with dark energy. Whoever wins will kill the universe in fun ways.
But who will that be?
We're looking at three possible ways to destroy the universe in our newest video.

Whenever I feel sad and demotivated, I watch this channel to remind myself that how big and mysterious the universe is and how insignificant my failures are.
The waiting for a new episode was cut in half
The productivity of these animators are unbelievable
Kurzgesagt never fails to give us an existential crisis on a friday evening
I think it'd be interesting for a video to explain if a type V civilization can do anything to combat each way the universe is destroyed
I love these anthropomorphizations of these universal forces. They feel like they could be end bosses to a JRPG or something stellar like that.
I remember watching the first version of this 9 years ago. It is cool seeing this remade again, but i find it interesting how much more of this I can understand now
Interesting to see how Kurzgesagt has evolved in rhe 10 years since they put out their first video on the subject (which also introduced me to this channel)
The art quality of this video is absolutely exceptional, truly a masterpiece
This video brilliantly explores the mind-boggling concept of universe destruction. The mix of science and animation is top-notch, making complex ideas accessible. I’m both fascinated and slightly terrified by the possibilities!
- [00:00] 🌌 The Duel of Cosmic Forces
  - Introduction to the cosmic fate determined by two entities: matter and empty space infused with dark energy.
  - Explanation of matter's gravitational pull and the counteracting force of dark energy pushing cosmic expansion.
  - Depiction of a battle between two cosmic forces that will ultimately shape the fate of the universe.

- [01:59] 🌟 Dark Energy's Influence: Constant Strength
  - Scenarios depicting the consequences if dark energy's strength remains constant.
  - Detailed explanation of the ""Heat Death"" scenario leading to an eternal, expanding, cold universe.
  - Stages of universal dissolution: galaxy mergers, stellar deaths, dissolution of structures, and the ultimate lonely particle existence.

- [04:47] 💥 Dark Energy Amplification: Big Rip
  - Exploration of the catastrophic consequences should dark energy increase in strength.
  - Detailed portrayal of the ""Big Rip"" scenario: rapid expansion leading to the destruction of galaxies, stars, planets, and atoms.
  - The ultimate catastrophic outcome, where even black holes are torn apart by amplified dark energy.

- [07:13] 🚀 Dark Energy Reduction: Big Crunch
  - Explanation of a scenario where dark energy weakens, allowing gravity to prevail.
  - Description of the ""Big Crunch"": the collapse of the universe, potential collisions, and the possibility of a new universe.
  - Two possible outcomes: collapse into a singularity or a potential cosmic ""rebirth.""

- [09:34] 🌑 The Likely Cosmic Fate
  - Speculation about the likely scenario where dark energy remains constant, leading to Heat Death.
  - Acknowledgment of the immense timescale this fate entails, providing ample time for exploration and potential adaptations.
  - Encouragement to appreciate and make the most of the current universe while awaiting its fate.

- [10:03] 📅 Kurzgesagt's Human Era Calendar

  - Introduction and significance of the Human Era Calendar, symbolizing humanity's shared history and potential.
  - Promotion of the latest Human Era Calendar edition, emphasizing its significance and impact on Kurzgesagt's growth and vision
I actually prefer the big crunch the most, since this way, before everything dies, everything gets much closer together and sentient beings get to experience more of the glory of the universe. Also, I like the idea that it could result in another big bang and that this process might already have happened countless times in the past.
I absolutely love this channel. Its so awe-inspiring, with so much curiosity and just plainly a delight.
""Hi Kurzgesagt Team,

First off, let me say your videos are nothing short of awesome! I've been a loyal follower from the very start and have always admired the diversity and depth of your content.

I recently noticed a trend toward space-themed videos. While these are undoubtedly fascinating, I find myself missing the broader variety of topics you used to explore. For instance, your recent video on 'The Internet is Worse Than Ever' or my all time favourite 'Mind Uploading'.

These diverse subjects not only informed but also sparked my curiosity and imagination in so many different areas. That variation was something I truly cherished and looked forward to in each of your releases.

I just wanted to share my thoughts as a long-time fan. Keep up the fantastic work, and thank you for continuously feeding our minds with knowledge and wonder!
This is a masterpiece! Incredible work Kurgesagt! Thanks for these very intriguing and informative videos! Keep it up! I love these!
You guys are all artists- from the animators to the research-backed story and presentation. Truly mind blowing thank you so much
This is truly a masterwork! Amazing work, Kurgesagt! I appreciate how interesting and educational these films are! Continue as you are! I adore these!",27,Education,21500000,PT12M33S

All the brawlers sound fun as hell. Though I'm surprised the 3rd brawler is for the rt trio and not the castle court yard
Which brawler are you MOST excited for!?
SUBSCRIBE for update sneak peeks!
For Larry and Lawry I wish we could switch playing between them as long as both are alive. Also it would've been cool if we could choose with which one we start the match (this will also be the one that respawns during the match).
Kairos turns a 10 minutes Brawl Talk into a 20 minutes analysis and I wouldn’t want it any other way! 30 minutes of my Saturday well spent!
Watching Kairos after Brawl talk is compulsory 😊
3:33 It's not that the healing is inconsistent; Kit heals a flat percentage of the brawler's max hp every second.  The ""inconsistency"" is Meg's natural health regeneration.
I feel like one of the L Duo's gadgets will let us change to the other L, meaning we will be able to play as Larry (? the evil/bad one).
I think a better idea for Larry and Laury is that their super would make them switch out so you can have a different attack power!😊
Wasn’t sandy once classified as support?

UPDATE: it’s true. On the wiki it shows us that on 01/23/2020 Sandy was changed from a fighter to support. He was later reclassified again to controller, so kitt isn’t the FIRST legendary support, just the only current one.
Just a quick fix, there is a frame in the brawl talk where you can see mortis's gear speeds up bats by 50%. Great video Kairos!
It would be cool if for Larry and Lawrie you are able to change perspectives using maybe a gadget of some sorts.
I like having some sort of stage hazards like the ice. We haven’t had that since the minecarts and it adds some good variety
If they add hot zone 5v5, I hope, they add a contested mechanic, because having 10 people constantly coming to the zone will be more of a ""who reaches the zone first wins"" than capture and defend the zone

Also the cartoon trio skins is a wierd trio:
Anime cat maid Colette
""Cuphead"" Rico
And ""power puff girls"" Spike with mickey mouse pants
I think it would be fun if we had the choice to switch between Laury and Lawry. Just like how eve can switch her attack pattern by equiping star power. So it would be cool if we had the sp.
You can see how when Edgar activates his hypercharge, he doesn't get the reload buff. Only when he jumps with his super he starts having the red effect (sign of a reload speed buff like Bull's 1st star power and Meg's 2nd gadget)
It would be fun if it would be chosen randomly if you play Larry or Lawrie after respawn or joining a match 😀
Micos first star power allows him to instantly reload a shot when the bar is full
This is what brawl stars needs, this update seems so polished and like a whole new fresh experience I can’t wait for 5v5
I said it once and I’m going to say it again Kairos is the man for giving us the info we need after the brawl talk. Man I love Kairos best brawl stars YouTuber",20,Gaming,1050000,PT19M55S

Acaron is Raiden Mei and you can’t tell me otherwise. All my gems for her
This already feels like an anniversary video lmfao
I love how male and female takes turn appearing in PVs
I didn't think Penacony was going to be like this. it's magnificent
BLACK SWAN LOOKS SO GOOD IM SO EXCITED
Hook jumping to Trailblazer is just peak cuteness overload😍😍🥰🥰
It just makes me so happy that both MCs are shown in promotional material ㄟ(≧◇≦)ㄏ
Who's saving up for Acheron??
✋✋✋
She looks so cool✨✨
Saw on TGA, got me hyped af.
Everything for Black Swan and Acharon 🛐🛐
Those last 18 seconds got me screaming, SHE’S HERE
STAR RAIL RAIDEN AND SHE'S VOICED BY ALLEGRA CLARK I AM IMMEDIATELY FORFEITING ALL MORTAL POSSESSIONS
I'm happy that I decided to play this game! Congrats Honkai Star Rail for winning Best Mobile Game!
Beidou's VA, Allegra Clark is also Acheron's VA! She also voices Bloodhound from Apex Legends and Dorothea/Shamir from Fire Emblem Three Houses. I love her voice, I'm gonna have to pull her now!
As a caelus enjoyer people can finally shut up and just accept both mcs are cannon anyways congratulations HSR 🎉.
No way, it's Arryn as Black Swan? Nicely done! They also both look beautifully designed. Can't wait to see them in game!
Honkai: Star Rail never fails to make good content 😆 😂
I love Allegra Clark as Beidou. Such a fine actor. But I'm shocked they didn't go for Anne Yatco to play Acheron.",24,Entertainment,1600000,PT1M38S
CA,9K21r9LPrVk,Get Ready for Your Trip to Blueberry Academy!,The Official Pokémon YouTube channel,2023-12-07T14:01:24Z,"#PokemonScarletViolet,#PokemonScarlet,#PokemonViolet,#HiddenTreasureofAreaZero,#Pokemon,#BlueberryAcademy,#EliteFour,#Legendaries",675756,35563,Watch the final trailer for The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk to learn about exciting new ways to play Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet!,3835,"man I am so excited for the next Pokemon adventure!
Kieran’s new character design mixed with the music was really well done
I'm excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around Paldea, hope they're not Shiny Locked and you can finally get Shiny Sword & Shield Legendaries.
1:52 I love how when the player character sends out Iono's magnemite, she sends the pokeball the way Iono does. thats a nice detail
Everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary Pokemon, but I'm just glad we get to see more Larry!
Honestly, it feels like Teal Mask walked so that Indigo Disk could run. Looking forward to this one!
3:50 Not only am I glad Darkrai is getting the attention he deserves, but also challenging Dialga and Palkia with Darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie!
Yes!!! Blastoise’ 3D model is finally fixed. I’ve been wanting this for over 10 years. His face is sculpted proper, his cannons are the correct size, and his shell (white trim) is now sculpted properly! Ho-Oh’s new model also looks nice!
The fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
Terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries.  Not only does its lore look interesting, but we are finally getting the majestic minogame Pokemon that I’ve been wanting since Squirtle/Wartortle didn’t evolve into one!
Gen 9 isn't even over yet and I'm already nostalgic for it. And I've been a Pokemon fan since the beginning!
I’m so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool. Wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there. The music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement.
I love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders, can we have the team star members back as well, love those guys
This DLC has been amazing so far! it’s been personally heartwarming to see familiar Pokémon return and have new places to explore!
I’m so freaking happy all the starters are coming back! Can’t wait to find a Popplio!
I don’t often comment on YouTube videos….But I’m extremely excited for this one. Get to bring back some of my favourite Pokémon I collected over the years to join me in this DLC. I’m also excited for new Pokémon to catch and explore this new area. Been playing since 2006 when I was 14. Amazing that how Pokémon games have come along the way!!!
I hope that the catch rate for Legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown Paradox Entei and Paradox Terrakion
There's so much about this trailer that I'm really happy about! I am hyped, can't wait for this to come out!!!!
One thing I seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing! ❤️

And oh man, Keiran looks like he's changed quite a lot. I guess we'll have to see if there's a way to save him. But it looks like he's gone villain mode. Or maybs just angsty rival mode.

Still, it's gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again, and how the story is going to play out. I mean, getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too. Never even expected them to pull off a Dialga and Palkia Tera raid. Much less give out a Darkrai, even though you can get one in Legends Arceus, or BDSP if you managed to the Member's Card last year.

Still, all these new things are amazing. 💜
I can’t wait for the indigo disk, everything I’ve seen  looks amazing. Especially the fact we can get old starters from previous games and the extra interactions with the gym leaders and old legendaries too ❤❤❤",20,Gaming,5550000,PT4M14S

That’s the biggest plot twist of all time. Was expecting a survival game but we were given a whole dumpster surprise
We are not surprised. The developers are laughing all the way to the bank for every single person that spent $40 for this.
The fact this game was the most wishlisted game on steam is insane
I was pretty much expecting it to be this bad. What kind of bothers me is how they marketed the game. In one trailer, they scripted it as to make it seem like the two players are speaking to each other using VOIP. Their usernames highlight when speaking and everything. Features like that get shown in trailers and then end up being non existent in the game. It's no wonder they deleted the old trailers from their channel. IGN kept them uploaded though.
The fact that people had such low expectations for this and it still managed to do even worse is incredible.
Well done everyone for feeding this type of scams.
The Day Before is a perfect example to never, ever, under any circumstances, trust a trailer or pre order anything before a full release
They didn't disappoint, it's exactly what I expected
I wasn't waiting for this game, I was waiting for this video.
Hey. Pick up some Merch maybe? https://bigfryshop.com - Thanks for the amazing day!
Just so be clear: The entire city map (which is not even open world) is a Unreal Engine store asser you can get for $539
Hopefully other devs see what these devs promised, showed in trailers, and can make the original idea into a reality.
The alarms use so many resources, that zombies cannot spawn in. Maybe if they reduce the amount of alarms from 1000 to 10 they could add 5 more zombies. Wow, what a SAD game.
5:17 i'm legit crying tears of laughter. Great work on this man I know you were on this literally since the day before day one and love to see it come full circle. I don't know if the Day befores saga is finally over but always enjoy your takes on it.
I had a great time watching your stream today. Thanks for taking one for the team so I didn't have to waste my money on absolute garbage.
Watched your live stream while caring for my daughter. Thanks for the laughs. The absolute shame of this and other games they rely on our hope for something amazing. And sucker people in. This game deff solid bet on train wreck. Hence the sales it got no one wanted to miss out. Like watching a fight at school.
Something that promised so much and ended up being completely different can definitely be fit into a class action lawsuit. Especially this
The moment when the character running for hours and looking into sky and said "" So this is what a day before feels like, this is the day before that i always looking for""  Put tears in my eye.
I'll never forget how blown away I was the first time I saw the trailer. I just can't believe things turned out this way.
We all knew this was going to happen, what's upsetting is that I wanted it to be good so that I could have a fun coop shooter with the squad because we don't really have many games like that we aren't sick of. My next hope of ""things that could be cool but probably will be really bad"" is Ubisoft's Skull and Bones. It can't be that hard to make good games that people can play with their friends.",20,Gaming,328000,PT10M28S

Bidstrup took it like a legend. Huge respect
Edit:Wtf I checked my phone cuz I thought this comment got 1 like 💀💀
It's always a long wait for a new video from Chris. But when it finally arrives, it's a piece of cinematic gold...
The video we've all been waiting for, let us know if you wanna play for us soon 😉
To everyone in the comments, check out our channel for more Chris vs Mads content 🙌
I swear Harry has never made a clean tackle in his life 😭
Bidstrup is a legend u can see his passion even if its a youtube video big up the lad
Your ability to consistently evolve and innovate is admirable
You notice how much later the defender acts the higher the quality national league onwards they even start approaching chris rather than positioning themselves and making chris go round. They are also much better at picking the moment to make the challenge. Small things but big differences
Manny destroying everyone was so entertaining
Chris dashing the ball at W2S mum brought it to another level. 😂
Awesome to see Levi Colwill in this video, met him when Sholing got promoted to the 7th tier last season and was very supportive to his cousins as they won the playoff final against Hamworthy United.
the pros were all really down to earth that's cool to see
The way the defenders actually progressively got better was cool to see
chis always proves me wrong with his skills its actually class
Bidstrup’s a class guy, seems really down to earth
the fact he went all the way to Gurnsey to record that clip with Harry’s mum just shows the dedication he has to creating content
Chris is one of the best YouTube football dribblers, he can play against top of the level defenders yet he still won’t preform the same in a charity match🤦
Crazy that Bidstrup mentions one of the best dribblers he has played against is Di Maria, & Benfica Has just won 3-1 Salzburg.
Di Maria Scoring a Corner Goal. Absolutely INSANEEE!!!
Ive been watching your videos for almost 10 years now and they are always such a fun watch. You still have so much authenticity which almost gives like a nostalgic feeling when i watch your videos

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",278,"He said Man United would win the champions league and they didn’t even make it out of their group 😂😂😂
Imagine losing the group stage to a squad that is cheaper than Antony.
United fans spent the whole summer mocking Liverpool fans for not getting Champions League only to finish bottom of their group lol.
United conceded 15 goals inside a group with Galatasaray and the giant Copenhagen... It'd be so unfair to classify even to Europe League
Ten Hag's record this season is worse than Gary Neville's record at Valencia 😂😂😭😭
I cannot wait until we play you guys on Sunday 😂
Masterclass from hojlund ???  how to avoid the ball for 95 minutes? well done !!!!
It’s Goldbridge and chill tonight! 😂
Sad to see the underdogs finish dead last 😭
The notion that no other manager could do better than spending 400m and finishing bottom of a group with GALATASARAY AND FC KOBENHAVN with 4 points and 4 defeats is laughable and extremely harmful and corrosive to Manchester United. Utter mismanagement right from pre-season with his training regime that has resulted in shocking fitness, injuries and medical management. That was a training session for Bayern.
Bring Ole back to the wheel😂
Keep blaming the Glazers. For giving the manager £400m
Mark owns up to his mistakes about Sancho and Onana but he is too obstinate to know that Ten Haag is a mistake too.
Respect to Copenhagen everyone thought they’re finish last
Remember Ole persuaded Haaland to join Man Utd before Haaland moved to Dortmund but Man Utd refused the contract terms.
Don't be sad Goldstein Varchester United played really well!
TenHagBridge really loves Ten Hag.

It's always McTomminay's fault, or Solskjær.
It's more long term to focus on Hannibal instead of McTomminay because we're not going to build a future midfield with McTominay anyways we have a midfielder with good enough passing and good enough ball control to be a United player in Hannibal he has played for the academy and he's United as well. He's more qualified to be a long term midfielder for us and he should be prioritized like other young players like Garnacho if he did I think he could be a really good player for us in the future
I'm happy wht tonights performances I could see ths team are still in the building process

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1438,"David de gae kept utd from bottom of the league table for a decade I hate how he was brushed aside.
Ten Hag in his post match said, we played well, and we didn't deserve to lose😂😂
I can't believe you actually thought they would win, Mark.  With that team?  ""We are Manchester United""?  Yep, a mid-table team with horrible players and management.  It will take years to get this team back to even consider fighting for top 4.
But Mark, you have to admit that other than Martinez, Ten Hag’s signings have been just terrible and very expensive
The problem is that because ETH rates players like Onana, Antony, Mount and Mctominay, I don’t rate him.
Karma boys we laughed at liverpools 30 year wait for a title looking like it's gunna be a lot longer wait for us as we are a absolute mess on and off the pitch
Figure it out, ETH wanted Onana,he got him . Not the Glazers, ETH .Accountability!
What does accountability of Ten Hag mean if a possibility of firing him isn’t on the table?
Manchester United are the first Premier League side to finish bottom of their UCL group on two occasions (Also 2005/06).  Record breakers. Also the first English side to concede 15 goals in UCL.
Onana has been a revelation in goal….a terrible revelation that Ten Hag has no f**kin’ clue. Cheers Erik!😂
For me it's Mainoo, simple as that...The kid's got a needle eye for a through ball and he's brave enough to attempt it. We need a central midfielder who can play through the spaces in front of him, we can't be playing side to side long balls all the effin time, like why is this kid not constantly starting?!!!!!
The biggest disgrace of all is mark goldbridge for blaming everyone except the manager who apparently buys the players picks the team and decides what tactics to play
We pay world class wages to third rate underdogs
David is laughing his ass off and enjoying every single moment!!
Ten Hag is sacking himself! Playing Mctominay, keep starting Onana, not subbing off Bruno. Kmt. If he gets the sack, he deserves it  He can blame no one but himself. Kmt.
A lot of people don’t wanna hear it but Bruno ruins the team. It’s not just his attitude but he loses the ball too much. Either a terrible pass or a terrible shot. Occasionally he’ll slap a beauty but most of the time he’s a losing factor. Either way he’s way too risky. If you watch him play he goes into strike pushing our strikers out of their position. His attitude stinks. Complaining at the players constantly when they make a mistake but takes no accountability when he makes a selfish play and skies the ball. Or when he shoots a free kick from miles away instead of whipping a pass in. Honestly he has to go. And mctominay 
Don’t get me started on mctominay
You’ll blame anyone and everyone other than Erik Ten Hag for the team he manages.
As you sit and listen to Mark defend ETH's job after this, just remember Mark unironically believed Manchester United would WIN the CL this season. He said this despite knowing who the manager was and the players we had.
If you go from believing we can win the competition, only to come 4th in a favourable group, then the manager has to be blamed and his job is clearly untenable. 

ETH spent weeks saying he needed a left footed player at LCB as an excuse for his ego trip with Varane and then tonight kept him at LCB while Evans played RCB. He constantly talks about standards but Onana, who has now led us to being the English team who has conceded the most goals in a CL group stage ever, got to play every game despite costing us points. The sooner this guy is gone the better.
I don’t see why we signed bayindir when he hasn’t played a game, surely he’s good enough to play cup games
They sanctioned Onana's  deal because they believed in Ten Hag who is now showing us how clueless he is we need to get rid of him with the immediate effect",17,Sports,1790000,PT39M41S

The big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), Souheila Yacoub (“The Braves,” “Climax”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).

“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

Villeneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel. The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick. The executive producers are Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.

Villeneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Denis Villeneuve, “Dune: Part Two.” The film is slated for a March 1, 2024 release in theaters and IMAX nationwide and internationally beginning on 28 February 2024, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",7410,"Let's be honest, Denis Villeneuve, the music, the trailer, was just epic. One of the best trailers I have seen in years.
This looks incredible! When we say we want the visuals THIS is what we mean. 😭
I haven't gotten actual goosebumps on my body because of a film in years.  This can only be seen properly in theatre.
Denis Villeneuve deserves lots of respect for being brave enough to take such a project considering how many dune movies failed. Also the fact that they've built everything especially in the era of green screen movies shows how much love Denis and the team have for the process.
This film stands as the cinematic masterpiece we've been yearning for, elevating storytelling to unprecedented heights. Its impact on the sci-fi genre is unprecedented, setting a new benchmark for future endeavors!
“But I do see a way… there is a narrow way through…” I absolutely love the way he said that line! I’m so excited for this movie!
This film is the cinematic brilliance we've been waiting for for decades. It really takes movie making to another level. I really don't think there is any sci-fi series like this one is showing up to be.
By far, one of the finest movie trailer in recent years. The build up is just so powerful and awe-inspiring (especially with the gorgeous music). Denis seems to have outdone himself with this one. This is gonna be an incredible movie experience filled with emotions and hope. It is so amazing that a director can make such quality motion pictures one after the other and releasing almost one every two years. He is also the new master of intelligent and profound Science-Fiction films. I mean, Arrival, Blade Runner: 2049, Dune Part One, Dune Part 2 and most probably following next will be Rendezvous with Rama and Dune: Messiah. An amazingly talented artist.
That SILENCE!! gave me serious chills, I had to watch it again, can't wait to see the actual scene 😭
This is not a movie. This is pure art.
How the heck does Denis Villeneuve deliver yet another ""classic"" that works so ridiculously well this day and age... incredible!! I am just hoping he does more projects similar to this (taking an ""oldie"" and bringing it to the modern audience).
I'm a huge fan of the Dune universe and I absolutely love the atmospheric translation in these movies from the books!! There's also a game in development called Dune Awakening, so I love how we are finally giving this universe the attention it deserves 🥳🥳🥳
This movie franchise is a work of art. Love the books, love everything about Part I, Part II is a must see.
Princess Irulan looks like a prisoner of fate. You can tell the team behind this is on the next level, when they think everything through so thoroughly that even a character's costume embodies their story.
YESSSSSS!!    Throughout the trailer I had goosebumps, bigger than I have ever had! Clean to the end, and even after!!!!   I don’t think I have ever seen a movie trailer that has me on the edge of my emotional seat like this one does!!!!
Since the first Dune movie, I've been obsessed. Best stuff that has come out of Hollywood in years. Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer go hand in hand here, cause it was the first time I came out of a cinema in absolute awe of the score. My Spotify Top 5 of '23 is all Dune :))) Hats off, and I really look forward to Dune 2, not less than how I looked forward to The Return of the King 20 years ago.
Absolutely blown away by this trailer! The visuals, storyline, and suspense have me eagerly counting down the days until this movie hits theaters. Can't wait to experience this epic adventure on the big screen!
Major goosebumps. Everything about this looks incredible. I loved Part 1 and I'm all in for Part 2 - I just wish I could watch it now.
The cinematic event I've been waiting for. Dune will win best director, editor, cinematographer, music, costume and VFX. If it doesn't then I don't know what should. This is a pure labour of love. I would like to thank my favourite director of all time for inspiring me with everything he does. Cannot wait!
Denis Villeneuve is an absolute master - I've loved all of his movies, this will be incredible, just like part 1 was...",1,Film & Animation,11300000,PT2M40S

#UFC",2092,"Brandon Royval just casually running 10 miles at 6.5-minute pace is impressive. Dude has excellent cardio.
Leon’s first NFL game was one of the worst scoring games ever 😭 3-0
My takeaways from this:
I am absolutely exhausted watching Pantoja workout. What a demon.
Paddy catches a lot of shit. When he’s away from a hot mic regarding fighting, he seems like a good guy.
As an American, I want to apologize to Leon for attending that awful fuckin NFL game.
Heart says Wonderboy 
Brain says Shavkat 😔
Watching wonderboy strike is like watching a painter create a work of art. Shit is so impressive, man.
Tony is 0-6, yet I still can’t wait for his appearance on the embedded.

Guy really is a legend, and a hell of an entertainer. Hope this is his last rodeo whatever happens.
100% respect Colby is right he is one of many few fighters on the roster that really does fight at his weight class. How can you not respect it.
You gotta respect Colby for keeping it real and fighting at his weight class. Half of the champions in the ufc or more don’t fight at their normal weight class
The flash of genuine Colby when they brought out the candles, you could tell he loved that
You can tell that Colby is a good guy and just plays a character. Seen many interactions from him like the one with the waiter 🙏🏼 People have to separate the PPV selling Colby from the person he seems to be
Still makes me sad Pantoja got booed after he won the belt. He left it all in the Octagon and that interview had a grown man in tears. “Dad are your proud of me now “ 

I like both Brandon and Alexandre but I’m rooting for Alexandre
You just can't hate Thompson, so humble
So pumped to see Colby back in action. The guy is a true gem of the sport, hate or love him, he’s thoroughly entertaining on camera and in the Octagon.
Really rooting for Colby to get it done. He is fighting a guy that holds two wins over a guy that beat Colby twice decisively.
Not a Colby fan but I respect his decision to fight at his natural weight class and his overall dedication to the sport. He seems to always be in fighting shape. He has a point about the dagistani guys being weight bullies
Thing i love the most about Colby is, He doesnt cut much weight, Maybe 4 kilos, he aint no weight bully like most of the other guys
Cool seeing Colby being his true self and not the alter ego for a moment. This card is gonna be a banger 🔥🔥🔥
Man Wonderboy does not look 40 years old at all! 😳💯
Seeing Pantoja and JDS so happy and down to earth is so damn wholesome
Can tell Colby is actually a really good dude. His manners and respect to the waiter were absolutely tops 👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT9M25S

Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub

Ankaragucu’s president, Faruk Koca, struck the referee, Halil Umut Meler, at the end of their home match after Rizespor scored a 97th-minute equaliser. Koca walked on to the pitch and hit the referee when the final whistle blew in the 1-1 draw at Eryaman Stadium. The president of Turkey's football association, Mehmet Buyukeksi, condemned the event as an ""inhumane attack"" and announced an indefinite suspension to matches in all Turkish leagues. Koca and two others have been arrested for ""injuring a public official"".

#Football #Rizespor #Ankaragucu #SuperLig #FarukKoca #Turkey #News",468,"Such a massive embarrassment to the Turkish people. There needs to be some extremely harsh consequences for this or we will just see it replicated some time in the future. This is a great example of what losing control of your emotions can result in
Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Prison is the only place for these people.
The guy that kicks him in the face while lying on the floor is even worse than the guy who threw the first punch.
Real men doesn't do such ill-mannered offensive things! Real men behave themselves!
Absolutely disgusting behavior & very immature. Hope all involved in the assult on the Ref get arrested
He was kicked by another guy on the right as well , hope they dont miss it
The kick was worse then the punch
I hope that ref is okay.
I've seen the behaviour of grassroots football in the UK and that can be quite bad. 
I've haven't seen anyone assaulted but its come close a few times and the abuse hurled at refs by fans, players, coaches can be awful.
just to say that a year ago this guy took a fair play award
So cheap shots him and then someone kicks him while he is unprotected. Class! Keep watching soccer gents, we dont want you in rugby games.
If this happens to all leagues anthony taylor would have been dead years ago 😅😂😂
If it happened in England, English clubs would be thrown out of every competition going. It won't be dealt with the same way here though.
And people wonder why we have a referee shortage....
Kicking a man while he is down is simply pathetic
I'm not condoning this behaviour as its wrong on every level but I believe there's a simple reason why it happens, or why there's a strong potential for it to happen, at any top level game.  The reason is that there's FAR TOO MUCH MONEY involved in the modern game, growing it into a monstrous entity worldwide.  This places pressure to perform upon managers and players, pressure from sponsors, etc., to win games and trophies.  It has grown too big, too fast and needs calming measures applied
before something worse than this punch happens.
Turkiye boyle bilinsinnustemezdik
Even his captain was shocked 😮
The neck brace 😂😂
That hospital scene like something out of a comedy sketch. That punch wouldn't have knocked over a 5 year old.
Very often, such thuggish behaviour can be attributed to the culture. Of course, this should not be deemed as an excuse. You should have seen the crowd trouble in Indonesian football stadia. The players too get consumed by the events , the spectators would be wondering if they are watching a kung fu spectacle. 😮
If the police could arrest corrupt referees, people wouldn't resor to DIY justice.",17,Sports,262000,PT1M2S

Kratos is not just the god of war,but he is now,the god of hope.
Kratos, the Spartan, the god of war, and most importantly, the father of boy, is one of those characters who will always have a place in our hearts.
There's something eerie about seeing a younger Kratos in this modern light. I've grown to love the Older Kratos, but at the same time you are terrified of the younger Kratos.
The god of war becomes the god of hope. I think we can all agree that Kratos deserved this ending more than anything.
Everyone's talking about Young Kratos (and rightfully so), but can we give a round of applause for Tyr? The fact we got to fight him not once, but FOUR TIMES was amazing. And that last encounter? Pure Awesome.
That young Kratos looks more ruthless and soulless than his original look. They did great job in representing young wild Kratos who still doesn't seem to understand what was going on with him at that point🔥
If old kratos hates himself from the past, you know very well how far the legendary god of war has changed. What an absolute legend
Seeing Tyr going from a nodachi to a macahuitl to even more, he truly has traveled a lot
Kratos really came full circle. He became the God of Hope. When all else was lost he still found hope to move on. I’m happy to see he never forgotten Pandora’s words.
The size difference and the different vibes young Kratos and Old Kratos have is amazing. Specially when young Kratos moved from his pose, it was so menacing
I'm not gonna lie, I almost teared up watching this ending.

Mental health has been very important to me within the last few years and watching Kratos try to wrestle with his issues while learning to accept them has been really inspirational.

Definitely one of the best examples of a man overcoming his pass trauma in a healthy way.
Looking at this scene, I can't help but think how many times I have wanted to do the exact same thing Kratos did. Staring my young self dead in the eye and claim that he was young, selfish, stupid, cruel, and nothing more than a lowly piece of work, but then realize how far I have come in my years. I needed this more than anyone could realize. Kratos, your words ring a sound so resonant and beautiful that I was in tears. Your story, one of death, destruction, and chaos, but also of love, redemption, and hope. You bring hope to all who would cry out and ask the question: Who am I? We are who we choose to be, both of our past, and of our present.
Love how Kratos finally confronts all his regrets, and it hits hard.
God of War Ragnarok Valhalla Full movie / All cutscenes: https://youtu.be/b2vyOIMZgnI
7:58 This scene gotta be the most powerful scene in the whole gow franchise🔥
6:50 — 9:52
This is honestly Christopher Judge’s best performance I have ever seen. The emotions, the anger, the hate and then the sadness to pure realisation in his voice honestly made me teary inside.
This was such an emotional journey. Thank you so much to Santa Monica Studio for this beautiful gift. They're amazing for this who agrees with me? Seeing young Kratos meet with redeemed Kratos, facing his darkest past moments and seeing the world in a different light. This hits home for me because I suffer with mental health disorders and seeing Kratos face his younger self will be me when I recover.
Kratos confronting his younger self…
In my head, I picture that he’s gaining closure with his bloodthirsty past, and telling him that THIS is what he needed to become. The god of hope. The father of Boy. The god of redemption.
After everything Kratos has been through... He's earned this.",20,Gaming,1550000,PT13M29S

There are two constants in Mat's videos: His dad will always be a blast to watch and Freddy will always be there to save the day
Just recently discovered your channel and instantly became a fan. Your dad seems to be such a nice person, always smiling and supporting you.
I don't anything about fixing cars but this channel makes me feel feel like I can take on a rebuild myself
It may be the beer talking, but this is the best episode in a long time. Seeing the car drive at the end? *I couldn't stop smiling... So much joy, so well done!!!*
Damn man it's crazy you are able to accomplish this type of work in a small garage. Props to you, such an inspiration!
Matt absolutely love your channels. I was an original Top Gear fan. Your channels have filled that void & more. I'm reminded of my younger days rebuilding cars with my mates in the Sydney suburbs. So many highs, lows, pranks, expensive lessons. Mayy stories are still told today! Your dad is a real character & could have his own channel but glad he & Matt part of yours!
That's a monumental achievement  in only a short time,great chemistry on the channel with your team.
Keep up the great content 👌
Im so happy to see the car running. I feel like I'm part of the story because of the way Matt makes his videos.
Well done guys. Can't get enough of your dad's laughter. It's infectious.
Love the content... Big fan of your work, everyone in my house is cheering for you to achieve the goal off showing Richard that you can do it! Cheers from Portugal Matt and just continue your good work 👍👍👏👏
Does anyone give Mat a round of applause everytime he jumps in and drives a car for the first time after rebuilding.... can't be just me, super proud
yet again, blown away by your commitment and it makes me so happy to see you reach your goal, keep going Mat!
Greetings from Australia Matt…I’ve got to say it. You are a brilliant young man. We are so enjoying your videos as you meet challenges and quash them. To see the joy on your face makes us happy. Well done lad!
Stokes me to see your excitement on this build. Mat, honestly your work on all the cars is really inspiring! keep up the awesome work.
Dude  you are amazing man.
What you guys achieved is just incredible and thank you for taking all of us along for the ride.
It's a joy following your journey with rebuilding cars. You're one of the most humble guy on youtube doing this, and the production quality of the videos is off the chart! Keep it up Mat!

PS: Please make a Q&A-video to wrap up 2023 🙂
Matt, you’re truly amazing. It’s a massive deal for all of us to see you drive this car! 🎉🎉🎉

Finally, it's good to see they added some ACTUAL drift physics. Not the most realistic by all means, but it's hell of a lot of fun! Kind of wish it was available for more cars though, but this was a great little update. ❤
Yusuf Amir is so lucky, this is the first GTA Online video that has less dislikes and the community is less pissed. 😂
i love this so far; the game feels fun again and more alive. even just adding the animals has made things so much better. i love the new cars and im playing the missions rn. thanks rockstar, banger after banger.
can we all appreciate how long rockstar has kept gta 5 alive? its awesome to see a game from my childhood still relevant all these years later
Amir is one of my favorite side characters it the series and its so good seeing him back.
It's crazy that even as adults these trailers still make us feel like kids again.
For me one of the best updates so far. Thanks Rockstar thats what we want.
It's not a game it's pure GOOSEBUMPS ❤
I was convinced they couldn't add no more content to gta online lol but they gotta keep us entertained somehow gta online is the appetizer but we all know what the main course is 😋
Fico imaginando, algum dia a Rockstar conseguir fazer um mundo aberto para o GTA, com pelo menos uma região de cada País do mundo ou pelo menos os Países mais populares de cada região, iria ser INSANO se isto algum dia acontecesse
The drift handling and the drift mode are AMAZING!!! ❤

Yusuf easily one of the best GTA characters ever, lots of laughs in TBoGT. I never thought we'd see him again. It's a shame that R* gave up on expansions, so many characters could be better explored like Lamar, Yusuf, Roman Bellic, etc.",20,Gaming,10300000,PT30S

I think you look great, Dan! The fact you're over 30, a parent of two, and still making videos seems to have aged you a tad. You're still the same amazing gamer you were years ago. I'm almost 18 now and it doesn't feel real. Time flew by faster than I wished it would, but I wouldn't have ya any other way :)
To be fair Dan you have created such a big channel that we honestly just can’t hate anything you do because it’s just so wholesome to us, so just keep doing what your doing and we will enjoy being here with you
You never disappoint dantdm. It’s now rare for me to see Dan post something. This man needs award for being a dad and a YouTuber raising grown up children. 💙💙💙💙💙
You never disappoint, Dan
I've been dealing with lots of things such as cancer that is affecting my mum and having my niece recently deceased means alot to me thank u Dan u making a good decision for me and everyone who is struggling with this disease. Thanks to you, you have inspired millions to take your ideas and show them across the internet. Thx u Dan
Thanks for being so wholesome and inspiring! Still one of my favorite YouTubers after all these years!
Let’s just say that his content will always be loved and appreciated throughout the years.His videos always made me feel comfortable and joyful.
I can’t believe you’re balding at such an early age Dan. You did carry an entire generation
no matter what, he'll always be such a gaming legend, keep going Dan. :)
Dan is one of last people on youtube to have a title with this thumbnail, and actually deliver what was advertised. I’m glad I grew up with this guy.
as someone with a shaved head my whole life, you're taking a step in the right direction
This community is so great and wholesome, everyone is so sweet and it gives me a big smile on my face, Keep being awesome Dan.
thank you for being a great YouTube Dan! im so happy you did something you've wanted to do for a while!
looks nice! you've been around the block long enough that i don't think anything you do to your hair would actually make people mad. keep up being an awesome human, and hope you, Jem, and the boys have a nice holiday! 😊
Dan, there's little you can do to destroy the incredibly legacy you've built. Live your life to the fullest! You've done more than enough for us.
Dan is a YouTuber who raised me, and is raising even more people still. Even two of his own ❤
the amount of changes dan’s hair has gone through is beyond me
Whatever you do with your hair, you're still the man that spent years making so many people's child and teen years much brighter. Looks great!
Might have said this several times over and over, but I'm a big fan of Dan. Don't listen to the trolls, you look great! :D",24,Entertainment,28400000,PT5M33S

Good job Man United for making top four!
They do a good job of editing these matches to make it look like United attacked a lot in the game
Thst was pure torture and Bayern never got out of first gear 🤦‍♂️
Utd had one shot on target in a must win game...from a defender.

PL and UCL: ""Hold our beers.""
A wise man once said: “Eras come to an end”😂
What a pass from Kane.
A great team whose manager gets unfairly criticised, and Manchester United
As a neutral football fan I can say United have given me so much joy this season already.
Beautiful assist by Kane.
I don't look for man utd results to see if they lost, I look to see by how many goals.
Arsenal fan: I don't even enjoy United defeats that much anymore because they happen so often.
“Clearly United are playing better football without Ronaldo. The wingers are on fire without Sancho. Varane’s performance this eve proved why ETH is right In not picking him this season and ETH style of play is cleary visible in the teams performance. It’s the Glazers fault and a leaky roof that’s distracting the players” Gary Neville
Cant believe ten hag was pleased with the team performance and happy with his players. 1 shot at goal in a must win game says it all.
Erik Ten “Eras come to an end” Hag secured top 4 in the group.
Glad I'm at work on Sunday, I'll be surprised if Liverpool don't equal or surpass last seasons 7-0. This club is exactly where they deserve to be.
""I'm shocked at this result"" said no one. Actually I am, thought Bayern would score at least 4.
Missing neuer’s triple save in these highlights is a huge blow!
That goalkeeping was completely shocking on the goal. Made the finish so easy for him, you’d expect the keeper to come out and put pressure one on one. Stays so far back was actually shocked seeing it live",17,Sports,5130000,PT3M11S

Great season for Joselu he deserves it!
Bellingham 🔥
Bellingham is everywhere
Joselu passion for each goal he scores for Madrid is unmatched 🔥
Union Berlin stadium seems like a dark castle
It gives out an intimidating sensation that I can’t explain. Similar to galatasary
Bellingham is a proper  baller , sheer quality.
Madrid - the team of miracles
I'm happy for Joselu scoring but that first goal for RM tonight was definitely an offensive foul, how not?
How on Earth was this match tied at 2-2 with 88 minutes to go?   Real Madrid had so many chances.   However Real Madrid kept going and got the win.
I wanted bellingham to score but at least he got an assist at the end
I had both Bellingham's to score last night, didn't expect it to be Jude to let me down.
Que bien por Joselu se lo merecía 🎉
It’s amazing how Real Madrid unlike other big teams can have good players who aren’t elite or world class just good and yet still feel like a favourite for the champions league. In very few other elite clubs would players like Vazquez, Nacho, ceballos remain for as long as they have and a player like Joselu actually perform to the levels he seems to when he’s needed",17,Sports,5130000,PT6M2S

""I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,"" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.

Laufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with ""From The Start,"" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's ""Let You Break My Heart Again"" and ""Promise,"" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with ""California and Me,"" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.

20 seconds in and i got goosebumps already. love her voice so much
Laufey is just so good. She even tweeted back in 2021 that she'd like to be on Tiny Desk someday. It's 2023 and she's achieved that. Bravo!

It's crazy to think about how far she has come after that viral cover of 'I wish you love'. Definitely a result of great talent and hard work!
such a beautiful voice, she's gonna be a modern legend
I can't think of a more ""NPR"" artist than Laufey. Perfect match.
This is my first time hearing this melodious voice.  Laufey and her band woke me up this morning. What a joy.
Is it just me, but I can’t help but admire her in every possible way
i wish this tiny desk would last like 1 hour, 19 minutes of laufey's voice IS NOT ENOUGH
That was unbelievable, I had only ever heard the first song before. I just cried my eyes out. I can’t remember the last time music I hadn’t hear before hit me on such an emotional level. Such perfectly crafted songs, such palpable melancholy. I am overwhelmed in the best way possible.
Such a beautiful voice 😊. I've listened to Laufey's songs during the past few months and seeing her perfoming live at Tiny Desk is such a treat. I've had teary eyes during Promise 😢. I'd love to see her live one day :).
Her voice scale, control and timbre are just incredible. She reminds me of Ella in how she hits her lows. New fan.
What an honor to play chamber music with Laufey on this series 🤍 Hope soon again ✨
As a person who grew up in the classical music world, fell in love with it and then had to leave it behind, listening to you is simply a warm hug to the heart. Just thank you Laufey, amazing ❤
The audio engineer is a real hero to have captured this so perfectly so the rest of us could feel like we were in the room.

#ManchesterUnited #MUFC",1160,"Rangnick told the Board two years ago what they needed to do 

Sadly he was ignored
I feel like we could buy Mbappe and Bellingham and we’d just turn them into lazy below average players.
Klopp wanted Mount, Caicedo, even Amrabat was linked with Liverpool. He wanted Bellingham didn't get him, he bought MacAllister, Szoboszlai, Endo & Gravenberch & got on with the job. We can be complaining Ten Hag didn't get his targets, good manager's get on with the job & make it work.
Even the season when Mourinho got the sack we qualified from the group. We even beat Juventus in Turin. No excuses for ETH
All im saying is Chelsea bought Kepa for 80 mil. They replaced him with Mendy eventually. Its okay to make mistakes. But ETH does not wanna learn.
Erik Ten Hag has repeatedly said we are playing well when we arent. Hes either an idiot or a liar. 

Far less than 60% of his signings are correct.

His squad selections and player treatment is dreadful. 

The Glazers arent going anywhere, thats no excuse to keep a man who is making it all worse.
Rangnick had it right from the start he saw this coming we were warned but nobody took him seriously
A managers job is to get the best from his players. Just because a club is run poorly doesn’t give the manager a free pass. Rather it means he has to do even better and make use of every window and the squad.
I would go as far to say that the players went out on purpose, to get a break mid week so they can work on their brands
Every one knew that getting rid of Ronaldo 'the way he did' was going to come back to haunt him.
The main issue I have with Ten Hagg is that I don’t really see any progress around how we’re playing.
With Klopp early days they would be beaten quite a bit and finish low down the table but you could see what he was trying to do.
Ten Hagg….I just have no clue

The other issue is that while I would love a massive clear out but when you have players on long term contracts who don’t want to leave then there isn’t much you can do.
Personally the club does need a huge overhaul in terms of getting rid of a bunch of players combined with very good recruitment. That said though i also think ETH probably needs to leave the club aswell because Antony, Mount, Onana, etc were his picks for the club and they have been mediocre at best.
So glad Mark and others have seen this fanbase for what they are. Yesterday fans at the park were clapping the players off and asking for autographs and handshakes. I’ve stop blaming the Glazers, the players and management or even how the club is run. The biggest problem is the fanbase imo. Standards are on the floor. They would all turn up to the next home game in masses again
It's on Ten Hag that he didn't want to have talks with Rangnick or use his findings. Klopp met with Rodgers when he took over and had talks that were useful.
NOT SO FUN FACT: Last season United lost 12 games all season. After Sunday's game, United will have 13 defeats from 25 games, which stands for 52% games lost. 
And we're not even halfway through the season. 
Mic drop.
McTominay is nowhere near good enough for us, but I do have a certain respect for him. He'll play wherever he's asked, give his all, never complains, knows he's not liked..... some of the far more talented players could do with that mindset.
Its getting crazy that when we go 2nil up im still wondering if we will concede  rather than score another.
The biggest concern with the club, and this extends to the manager, is recruitment. Spending close to half a billion on new signings, keeping the deadwood and basically ending up with the same team as ole is unforgivable and would only happen to Man Utd.
At this point, I’m lost! I don’t know who to blame anymore. The way we’ve retrogressed over the years, is something I would’ve never imagined 12 years ago. I’ve never seen any big club, with financial prowess and a global appeal go down this bad. We are a mediocre! Every decision, appointment, signings made by this club becomes sheer mediocrity!
So many people don't seem to understand Mark's point on ETH. He is saying that just changing another manager right now will make him the scapegoat and will result in keeping the players, the leadership, the recruitment and everyone else and will change nothing. The next manager will be in the same exact position two years from now. For United to become a team that is competing for the top again, there needs to be a cleanout first,, and then bring in a new manager in better conditions",17,Sports,1790000,PT56M54S

#TearsoftheKingdom #LegendofZelda #SomethingSeries #Parody #NintendoSwitch #Zelda #Nintendo #Animation #TerminalMontage",5968,"Link does another speed run and ganondorf dancing his another suave dance

lol nice animation
Loved seeing Nabiu with a doortal at 5:33, can't wait for the pilot!
5:10 All things considered, Ganon using his own health bar as a weapon is metal asf
Rauru: “It would be reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this poi-“ 

Link: *wing shield jumps disrespectfully*
The five loaves passage used for a duplication glitch is actually genius
I love the ending where it seems that Link is going to save Zelda in the most emotional scene in the whole game until Link realizes that the speedrun is over.
I don't know what Zelda told Rauru about Link,but he was certainly not ready for that level of chaotic
I appreciate how you implemented the duplication glitch. Even though it was patched it was really this easy to use and I appreciate that you gave it some meaning. And the Ganondorf fight was next level.
I already knew he couldn’t get wrecked like the other endbosses because of *Suavemente* but I never would have expected that his weakness was no *Suavemente* .
Also I laughed so hard once he used his healthbar as a weapon.
In all it’s accurate to the source material and continue what you do best.
The fact that Ganondorf using his dance as an actual form of combat is hilarious and I love it 😂
The life ending neck cracks throughout the Terminal Montage franchise are so hilariously satisfying lmao
When Ganon started  dancing Suavemente and talking about copyright had me in tears, love the details 😂😂
Merry Christmas 🎄 Jeremy, big hugs to you and the team, I love your work ❤
All the enemies and characters in your style look so amazing, I’ve been waiting for this one for a while
Gotta love how Link doesn't even bother trying to save Zelda the first time, then doesn't even visibly question or react (beyond the mandated QTE) to the fact that she's suddenly appeared out of nowhere in free-fall... and _STILL_ leaves her to take a dunk in the lake. 😂
4:25 this is my favorite moment, you can feel link's determination as he runs toward ganondorf and the music in the background is getting louder as link approaches ganondorf
A rush of dopamine always hits hard every time I enjoy the chaos of another video. 

Also I love how faithful your videos are to the glitches in the game lol.
4:21 I can't imagine how terrified that bokoblin must've been: he probably just heard explosions and the screams of his brethren accompanied by menacing ""hyah"" sounds, and then Link just morphs out of the wall like some kind of eldritch creature
Your animations will never get old
3:25 As much as I find the gloom hands to be terrifying, I would imagine it would be cool if Ganondorf actually commanded the gloom hands or any other monsters to attack Lookout landing. It wouldn’t add much to the story but it would make it so it felt like Ganondorf was more of a threat.
4:47 is seriously the coolest attack animation you’ve ever done!
the amount of effort that goes into these is bonkers and I'm so grateful (as, I expect, are the speedrunners!)",20,Gaming,4360000,PT7M18S

Props to Keith and Becky for keeping their baby very private. Shows they're already great parents who care about protecting their kids over profiting from them.
The mystery event is 100% a 24 hour livestream of Eugene sitting on Keith's lap.
so much respect for Keith and Becky not sharing their babies name or face and not making it their entire personality *ahem*. that is the way to raise a child as a public figure. congrats to you both!
I appreciate the amount of love and respect they give to Eugene. The fact that he’s off making his dreams come true and they don’t make him pick try guys over that is amazing. He’s still apart of the team and receives so much love from the guys and that makes me so happy ❤
I can’t believe the return of candid competition isn’t the biggest announcement that’s incredible news
I consider Kwesi an official Try Guy. He fits so well, he’s so perfect. So funny and sweet.
even though the situation that caused it was awful, i think the changes that came to try guys because of it were incredible. the variance of content, the variance of on-camera personalities, it's all such a breath of fresh air. there's so many different styles of people that are regulars on try guys now, there really is something for everyone.
I miss Eugene, but we're all proud of him, and excited for everything he's a part of. I struggle with change, but y'all make it exciting.
I would love to see another episode about Zach talking about his chronic pain management. Him trying out all the different popular devices available helped me out a lot!
The best thing Try Guys did aside from removing the negative energy is bringing the gang in. Jared, Kwesi, Johnny, Marissa are the best additions to the Try Family.
Okay, I gotta say. You guys blow my mind. I first arrived here because of ~the event~ but I stayed here because I liked your personality, and because I was genuinely surprised with your high quality content no matter how fun or “dumb” they are. In the past year I’ve been learning more and more about how you manage the company, how you create more content, etc and wow, I respect it so much. And this video just confirmed it even more for me.
Honestly for the past year and a half this has felt like the Keith and Zach channel and Eugene is the cool cousin that visits every once and a while which is kinda nice because it makes you more excited to see him and Zach and Keith have always been my favorite try guys
I've said it before and I'll say it again. This channel has the most talented editors. Every single video looks SO incredible.
I really feel that this channel in this era has some of the best talent in the industry both on and off screen. So happy to have been here since the beginning and for the continued growth!
i am so damn proud of them. To see a group of friends that been through a lot together for 10 years, i am SO DAMN PROUD
We miss Eugene when he's not here, but I'm so happy for him working on his dreams and working so hard to achieve them, I hope it all turn out great for him <3
The way they are so candid about why they’re charging for the live show and the financial struggle of working on YouTube is incredible honestly I love that about them
I love that eugene is still involved just enough to prove that they still support each other and have a strong friendship
I did NOT KNOW Eugene voiced in Nimona!!! Sad to hear he’ll be less in videos but letting him follow his dreams is also so incredibly exciting!",23,Comedy,8060000,PT8M23S

#WildCamping #Hiking #Adventure #BadWeather",1020,"Hey Guys! Sorry this took so long! It’s unexpectedly turned out to be my longest video so far and it took me weeks to create, hope you like it :) I think my brain has melted a lil bit haha. Much Love 💚
No one can accuse you of being a fair weather camper.Thank you for taking us in to the wild with you .very brave young lady ,hope the ankle holds up for the next adventure.
As a newly involved Wild One, you are such a delight to watch. Positivity and humour, and tonnes of entertainment.
Camping in a tent in bad weather is pretty much the only reason to leave home in the first place. Overcoming adversity and challenging yourself, you have an adventurer's spirit.  Well done.
Hi Claire, since finding your channel I've dragged myself up my first 5 Munros experiencing 45mph winds with rain and sleet, low cloud with sideways hail or -9 Celsius and a foot of snow with the best views. I was scared to put myself to such a test and seeing you doing what you do gave me the push I needed. You do scare me sometimes though the way you 'wing-it'. Stay safe, stay warm, stay dry and stay strong.

Facing the trepidation of the first step.
Loving the elation of reaching that summit.
and reliving those moments as you look back at the route that was taken.
Hi Claire! Fantastic jaunt into the wild. If no-one's mentioned it, those jelly like blobs are probably frog egg sacks. They aren't always found in water, and those may have been laid when the water level was higher, or there was a puddle right where they were.
You're awesome Claire, keep being you. And inspiring others to get out and explore.
As someone who’s encountered rampaging cows in the mountains too: Never underestimate an angry cow! 😬Great video!
That third night was certainly a bit ‘lumpy’! To not only endure that, but to be able to video it for us ‘lesser humans’ to enjoy, was really something to behold. There’s something quietly heroic about you, Claire. Thanks for sharing your experience. Stay safe.
Now this is a good way to start the afternoon! I missed these videos. I'm glad you're back and hoping the ankle holds up. Edit: I'm glad about the ankle. You're right to be careful with it in the future because joints rarely, if ever, heal back to normal. 38 years later I still get the odd reminder that I abused mine. And you're so right about gratitude. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to call it a key to happiness. Thanks for the video.
I am so happy you provided intermediate updates on your ankle.  It was a worry with all of the variety of terrain you covered, that you may have suffered a mishap and gotten into trouble, thanks for reassuring us all with the status.  You do present such heartfelt productions.
I very much appreciate the positivity you demonstrate in your videos, your excellent skills and abilities, your acceptance of temporary discomforts, the joy you take in the little things, and the beautiful things, the tenacity you have in meeting challenges, the thought and planning you put into all that you do, your mental embrace of ""the moment,"" so to speak, the overall thankfulness you demonstrate for your time in nature, your sense of humor, and your over all joie de vivre. All of that comes through quite well in your videos, along with the beauty of all the places you visit, and makes your videos a pleasure to watch! Keep up the excellent work!
One of your most moving episodes Claire. Thank you for facing challenges with gratitude. You are a wise one, wild one!
I've watched all of your footage and never commented. You sometimes seem unsure, hesitant, but, you always pull through with a smile on your face and an incredible calmness... That's what it's all about, you're a true adventurer 🙌 keep living the best life WildBeare 💙
It's not about the miles Claire, it's about the adventure and you had one heck of an adventure. You always seem to pick those iffy weekends but if every weekend was sun and roses you wouldn't have got to feel alive like this. I'm intrigued to know what the jelly things were, maybe some mountain frogspawn? The night sky never ceases to amaze me, neither does your tenacity and grit. I'd like to reiterate what someone else said, Claire is certainly no fair weather camper/hiker. I'm glad your ankle has mended Claire and what a come back too. Excellent video. Thanks for sharing. Oh yeah, as for the length, I prefer the long format but that's just me. Stay safe and stay well and thank you for inspiring us.
There is no bravery without fear. Not growth without struggle. I’ve been watching your content for a long time. This is by far your best episode Claire. Not just the adventure, but the filming, editing and sound. My wife has a channel I edit and film for and I know this must have been an epic edit. Well done. It’s quality. Just awesome. I do this kind of thing too. I need to. I’m on the spectrum and need to unplug regularly. I completely get where you’re coming from. Keep this awesome content coming. I have a great friend with EDS and appreciate your struggle. So pleased the ankle is on the mend. Looking forward to the next one already.
Just beautiful.  I grew up going to the mountains every summer.  Backpacking, climbing, canoeing, camping.  It was the immeasurable gift I got from my father who is now with me only in spirit.  So wonderful that you are doing this. Share it with your son as soon as you possibly can, when he’s ready.  It’s a part of you that you can gift to him so that he can carry it forward.  Thank you for your eloquence.  You have a lot of wisdom.
I’m a project manager who spends 10 hours a day in an office. I stumbled across this channel and binged a bunch of videos. They have a remarkably calming effect. What an amazing life! I’m envious!
I think that might have been your best video yet. The journey, the message, the filming, editing and production. So pleased your ankle has improved to allow you to be you and thankful that you can share your story with us.
Amazing to see your journey as a person, a videographer, a camper, a hiker. Thank you for taking us on that journey with you. I have loved every minute.",22,People & Blogs,246000,PT43M53S

I seen very few games that I never get bored of. Truly a master piece. Thanks a lot supercell.
Adding hero equipment is such a good idea! I’m glad the devs found a way to make attacking more interesting and interactive without having to make it too complex
Just saw the patch notes, They changed the power potion effect from laboratory level to townhall level, This means you don't have to make lab your priority after upgrading to a newer townhall 🔥
*Loved everything so far but maybe a alternative TH defense would be better next time rather than the 4th remake of giga-inferno*
Wish we could still have the stat progress bars so you could see how the new equipment progresses with each upgrade relative to the maxed stats
I really love the update, specially the Nature sheme it looks so awesome but I it would've be alot better if the Townhall would do a massive earthquake when troops comes near it than this lame inferno weapon. But yeah thats my opinion.
to give a significant role to the walls now, they could start doing damage to troops, since they have fire, pikes or eletricity
I’m glad the hero abilities stayed at the right level good job supercell greatest update I’ve been present for
Edit: I do wish the blacksmith was elixir to upgrade instead of gold
I love how it’s straight to the point
I like when they add both new content for max players and some stuff for us mid-townhall players too
Been saying hero skins need to come with varying abilities for years now.. glad they finally made a way to have hero’s “adjustable”
What I think is that we were getting a free upgrade on our hero abilities by upgrading our heroes but now we have to extra grind for them separately 😅😅
The new troop is absolutely devastating it really opens up the base
Part of COC since a decade 🥺
Lots of love waiting for update as quick as possible ❤❤
One of the biggest updates ever. Never bored clashing. Way to go Team!! 👏
The Giant Arrow is so fun.

Its Hitbox might be a bit big though. It hits stuff that it doesn’t even come close to visually touching. A 0.5 tile radius would be more fitting to the visual and might help temper it’s power a bit.
Loved it ❤Wow such a upgraded version we awaiting 😊 Amazing 🎉
Respect for game developers
I love the hero equipment, as long as they don’t make it pay to win, it’s gonna be so much fun. It also allows for more build crafting for players which is so fun and makes attacks unique.",20,Gaming,20100000,PT3M14S

Molly, we support you and care about you. Always know your worth, not financially, but your inner worth. That’s most important of all. ❤
I think you’re both amazing. 🤍  People tend  to forget how young both Molly and Tommy are. To be first time parents while handling successful and busy careers all while being under the scrutiny of the media cannot be easy. You both get judged at every step.

it physically hurts my heart that you can't be more honest with us anymore 💔 you must be under so much pressure moll and you do an amazing job under the circumstances I look upto you so much and I hope you keep your pure heart ❤️
Girly you best believe when I had my daughter I chucked so many things away in first year of mum life because I was like I WILL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN. I was truly traumatised from the birth, colic, not good sleeper, regressions, my body and so on. BUT she’s nearly 3 now and I’m slowly starting to feel like I would love another. There’s so much pressure especially when they reach 2 years old to have another. Do what’s best for you, your mental health and your family. I always thought I’d have a small age gap but I’m SO GLAD I’m waiting until I’m ready! Xxx
The newborn stage is VERY hard! No one can prepare you for it! No matter how much support you have it is absolutely exhausting both physically and mentally.  I can’t even remember the first 6 months of my daughters life because I was so exhausted and I realised about 5 months in that I had terrible post natal depression. Honestly you are doing amazing Molly!  I was a single mum and I feel like with tommy being away at camp so much you must have been on your own a lot too. But yes - you are amazing and I completely understand where you’re coming from! Sending you lots of love and glad that you are all happy and healthy! X
So glad you openly talk about hard being a mum is. It literally is the hardest job in the world and I wish more people were open and honest about it cos I genuinely feel like this big expectation is painted for us and then when real life looks anything different it can feel so lonely. My little boy will be 2 in March and still doesn’t sleep through and it’s honestly hell not getting a proper nights sleep 😣 But then I have so many positive things to say too! Swings in roundabouts being a mum that’s for sure! X
I went to school with Conna and she was so glam at school, it’s mad how she created her brand at such a young age and how successful she is 👏🏻 🙌🏻
this is my favourite video i have ever watched, molly mae is so real and genuine and i look up to her so much, her and Zoe's videos keep me going honestly don't know where i would be without those two
I'm glad you are both going to be ok.  I can't even imagine the stress and scrutiny. You are stronger than you think Molly ❤
*-Her pride is not in her appearance alone it in her strength kindness and beauty-*
🥰😘
it was 10 months for me when I finally felt at ease with having a baby. It stopped feeling like such forced joy but real joy x
Molly I love this video so much and your candidness and this type of content is so needed ❤ so many women show the positives (which is fine) but there are negatives too, although they often fail to get mentioned!!  the fight or flight comment is so real because those without kids don’t understand you literally have someone’s life in the palm of your hands literally so you can be extremely anxious especially at the beginning!! But I think this talk was really a tribute to what a good and thoughtful mother you are because you are aware and honest about your struggles!! Bambi is so lucky to have a mom like you ❤
*Her pride is not in her appearance alone it in her strength kindness and beauty* ❤️💜💙
*3:43** Let's only take a moment to appreciate how much hours and work she put in this vid?It's unbelievable and I think they deserve a lot more than that*
I also hated the newborn stage but am THRIVING in the toddler stage. You've got this 🥹❤️
Yes! We’re definitely waiting for 2nd one ❤but best thing being a mum but hard work you don’t know until you become a mum x proud of you girl!!
I'm a first time Mum with a 4 month old and I honestly watched you throughout your pregnancy and having bambi and hearing you talk about your own experiences is so so what I needed to hear it is so hard at the start and you finding your feet I feel like I'm finding mine too navigating your new life with a baby, your new body, skin, hair everything we need more people to be open about th3 struggles cause too many people on here and insta try to be perfect and that's just not life for everyone. You being open and honest is absolutely the best content and just a thank you from one first time Mum to another for being so real ❤",22,People & Blogs,1840000,PT27M43S

#pokemon #legendarypokemon #infinitefusion",532,"Pokemon fusions are one thing, but the fact things like Deoxys and Regigigas and just chillin 5 feet outside of town should be really worrying the locals
The only thing I regret is not fusing more Legendaries with Magikarp
I actually like this „twist” to a fusions playthrough, because we get to see the cooler/rarer fusions
No chance John wins that champion battle without Tyler, he really saved the day
The miltank and raquaza fusion from the intro is ingraved in my memory now. Tysm John and Tyler for putting this in
I Love that John still names his Requazas Gregory after that epic JMC episode in Season 1. 
I also love how John plays this game we all know Legends are the most fun to fuse XD
9:35 Loving the Ben 10 reference with this one. Been rewatching it this week for the first time since I was a kid AND just finished my first ever Infinite Fusion playthrough so its really fitting to see a Chronosapien/Clockwork reference in this Fangame! I hope you do more videos on it!
PM7 providing top notch quality videos right when I’m about to eat lunch. Lovely!
I love all the screams Tyler put in when he reveals the fusions it had me on the floor
""How can you follow up Giratina Square""
Lance: another one
Roger is one of my favourite fusions I've seen across all Infinite Fusion content! Love the videos John!
That Raikou/Hydreigon is so sick! That could definitely be a boss battle in Dark Souls or something.
I've always wanted to play Infinite Fusion but just have never found the time, it's nice to see someone exploring all the fun Legendary Fusions!
I can't believe it, he actually evolved Feesh. Raydos might look awesome, but it'll never recapture the image of Rayeesh
I seemed to always miss the wheel spins and just kept getting surprised by the current rounds of fusions 😂
LET""S GO!!!! Clockwork is a perfect inspiration for that golurk/dialga fusion!
25:31 That just about killed me.
It's never too late to do a playthough of a game! I've seen lots of Infinite Fusion playthroughs and this was a fun take on it! Really looking forward to the next part!
Also, I think the catch rate might be higher in this game (or fluctuate depending on the fusion) but I was still left in suspense at all the captures!
the only issue i have with these kind of randomizers is that it becomes too easy in the end, but most randomizers have a seetting to make it use fully evolved only after a certain level, so you dont see slugma's and pichu's in the elite 4
Super happy you're planning to do another video on this game! I'm a spriter for the game and I'd love to see you use some of my Legendary fusions! They won't be in the game until January though due to the update schedule for sprites",20,Gaming,819000,PT35M47S

FYI, there is also passive income if you buy the tow truck and the wall safe upgrade, so keep in mind. Avoid the staff upgrade unless you have spare money, so keep in mind. Should work like the one in the Auto Shop. This comment is for beginners only
I got my eyes on the new Mustang... Finally... a proper modern Mustang...
Just done the Cayo Perico start to finish (exactly the same way Taco does it) and I only noticed one small change. 
It the intel gather mission, when you steal the plane to fly to the island, the driver side door is no longer stuck open. This is excellent for my OCD 😂
I regret choosing the most expensive location. Hard to get into shop, gang attack could spawn, and cars don’t always spawn next to you
i hope that you can upgrade the MOC to have the led´s from the Christmas Truck or that the moc is the christmas truck
 Here is your Weekly Update video including all of the things added in the Winter DLC ""Chop Shop"" What do you think of this new DLC so far? More vids coming throughout the day!
Prices for old as heck police vehicles are insane.
The Range Rover was on my very short list along with the Escalade V and that 96 Impala SS was an AMAZING surprise but I'm still hurt about no new   Dubsta AKA G55/63... it's got to be one of the most requested vehicles in the community. The Turismo and the chop shop are the only things I'll have to purchase currently but that drip feed of new cars is going to drain me.
The new Grotti drives so damn nice! Liking the new Declasse Impaler LX but I just love them type of muscle cars anyway. The Vigero ZX and Dominator are pretty cool but I still prefer the roof up. Best feature so far... The garage organizer!
The vehicle prices are crazy 😂 I wish it was more like real life
Tuner update and Chop Shop are my fav so far, love the low grips and manual stick!
So far so good this is a solid DLC it's a W from me still would have liked to have a heist with this DLC as well but it's all good.
Top tier. I appreciate the time and effort put into the vids 🤙🏿

The car selection for this update is quite nice! Loving the Infiniti and the Camry
Another change that I noticed on PS is, when you fire the Avenger turrets, it changes to a different turret, they made it the same button
Well, I actually like the interaction menu updates. There are less items in each category now. Makes things like gobbling snacks while driving significantly easier. Will this change speed runs?
I’m probably the only one or one of the few people who is at all this excited about this vehicle, but I’m hyped that we can get the Cluckin Bell Van and omg the Baller S-TD only Rockstar would do that lol such an awesome name
Done my first complete salvage mission. Start to finish took almost 2 hours (without knowing what the heck I was doing mind) and made GTA$350,000 from it. 
Not the worst business by a long shot and I’m sure we’ll all get quicker at doing them. 
It was great fun. They’re like mini heists with intel gathering, setup missions and tasks (4 mandatory and 2 optional) and then the final steal mission. Mine was Maze Bank Arena. It was brilliant",20,Gaming,112000,PT12M52S

petition to make James say “Sims 4 For Rent Rent to Riches” at the start of the episode
James dabbing has to be one of the funniest things I’ve seen this month hahaha
It’s clear to me laird gets her inspiration to become a landlord after dealing with such an incompetent property owner😂
ITS HERE! 
Nosy, generous AND cringe? Uh oh, I think you accidentally made Laird into my mother 😭
I really love when James gets SO excited about how convenient and 'perfect' it is to have a maker's space in the world as if he didn't do it intentionally to help with handiness. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
when u find a bike (or any draggable item) in the dumpster.. you have to put it first in your own lot. then go to build buy and put it in the household inventory for the game to consider it as your own
The Sims team should update the woodworking table for sure! It's so sad that we have to use mods to make it fun to play with.
James constantly dabbing and wearing the cringe meme shirt is absolutely everything. This LP is already one of my favourites!! Also why is it kinda really easy to make money in this game by just scamming your landlord and spreading secrets? I swear this is the strongest start for any of the bigwallets
For the White Cake situation, it's the Foodie NAP. Get rid of it, and disable NPCs from voting for NAPs in the options. This is why I don't play with any of the NAPs, most of them just cause really annoying stuff like the white cake making to happen.
The landlord visit for the stove was so funny 😂 I have a feeling this will be a common problem for this LP..
Ah yes the 6 simoleons. She’s is basically rich compared to her ancestors 😂
I love how you’re not the landlord but literally doing ALL the landlord things 😂
I laughed way to hard at James saying “disable furry effect” 😭
Idk if it's a glitch oe not, but the landlord ignoring the burnt stove even after having it pointed out and paying Laird less than a quarter of it's cost was hilarious🤣🤣🤣
I think you should clear up the counter space or add some more counters so they stop leaving food unmade😭
mopping the floor outside while it's raining is PEAK of how landlords deal with issues LOL
I love that the McGloorbins are having their moment to shine as neighbours in this let’s play 😂

Thankfully Santa’s vision is based on movement. So glad that everyone is safe.
So impressive that Aunty Donna got the real Santa Claus to feature in their video.
I love it when the news gets a bit naughty, bit cheeky, all in good fun, all in good fun
this is exactly what its like to watch the news on Christmas eve
I love sketch. Sketchy sketch sketch. Here it goes down, down into my belly.
I love how Zach consistently mantains that gormless expression throughout. 

Anyway, time to get on with watching this video.
i'm just surprised santa had time to visit the studio in between delivering presents and cucking with elves
This is the kind of ground breaking news reporting that the world needs right now - bipartisan, sticking to the facts, and being professional at all times is so important.
I love the concept of having a Christmas themed skit all about some mundane Christmas thing. Maybe next year you guys can expand this and do one on some type of favorite Christmas dessert.
cant belive santa (who is poly) didn't give zach a bike after offering it. think zach has been a naughty boy this year.
I can’t believe Mick Molloy has been Santa this whole time 🤯 🎅
Now I want a news skit where mark is not just the weatherman but every single on-field reporter
Only Aunty Donna can get one of the biggest Aussie comedians, put them in an indistinguishable costume, and make no mention of who they are.
Good to see Broden has finally admitted defeat
i would have loved this sketch but as a professional kid i unfortunately had to go to bed so i didnt see it
Broden should wear glasses more in sketches. It gives him a totally different vibe.
Much like Superman/Clark Kent, he was completely unrecognisable as the character Andrew Stevenson

‘Ramsdale was beaten’ - it was an incredible reaction save onto the post! The Ramsdale hate continues
Elneny still being at Arsenal is mid-boggling. Only the player still left from the Wenger days
Happy Ramsdale got his debut finally and Eddie scored his first Champion's league goal. Was also pretty impressed by Nelson, Arteta has got to give him more of a chance in the league.
0:15 what a tackle by Saliba!
I’m not sure how Arsenal’s second goal was an offside. I think that was Kiwior’s goal. And he was on
That Bakayoko looks a player. Ripped us tonight
2:25 the save and reaction time by ramsdale is crazy
Player who headed Arsenal’s 2nd wasn’t offside!  What’s going on here?
Reiss nelson MOTM. Deserves more gametime.
2:29 do they not realise ramsdale tipped it onto the post ?
Reiss Nelson should be trusted more by Arteta. Great finish from Eddie. Lord please help Smith Rowe to stay injury free. Amen.
Bakayoko what a talent 🔥
Glad ramsdale finally made a well deserved champions league appearance. He is one of the reasons we are in the competition and his treatment over Raya has been awful by arteta. I wish Eddie scored in games when it matters as he has been pretty absent for some time now, needs to prove why we don’t need to seek a striker in the transfer window
2:33 Not offside, absolutely shocking decision, but that's nothing new against Arsenal, despite the game being meaningless.
I think the selection and the subs used in this game were needless from Arteta. I’ve no idea why he’s against playing the youngsters in a game like this. I genuinely believe that if Saka was in the U-21’s when Arteta joined us, he’d be nowhere near as established as he is now
i watched the match and ramsdale and elneny performed rlly well hope they get some more mins
Playing saliba and Gabriel come on bruv give them a rest knowing we’re topping the group regardless of todays result and the fact that we’ve got a couple of big games coming up too
Trossard really isn’t in form at the moment!😢
The save was so good the commentator had to say he was beaten. He couldn't believe it because it's not often keepers make world class reactions like that.",17,Sports,5130000,PT3M40S

Lyrics:
hi  
are you looking for the other side?  
feel like nothing ever seems quite right?  
are you circling the drain pipe, 
getting off on pain like  
you’re corrupted? 
i need to know where your loyalties lie  
tell me are you gonna bark or bite?   
do you really want to twist the knife  
in the belly of the monster?  
get the fuck up  
wake the fuck up  
wipe the system 
and back the fuck up.  
you’re a puppet  
when they cut your strings off 
don’t come crawling back.  

kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky 
kingslayer  
forevermore the apple of my eye  
i’d sacrifice my life to find you  
angel of the blade  
kingslayer  
come and collect us from the night  

暗い (Cry) 
 この見えない世界 
 まだ消えない未来 
 ただ手に入れたい  

another world  
this world is so dark that i can’t see  
the future won’t disappear  
but i want to obtain  
another world 

system failure   
life 
is encrypted  
you are modified  
like a virus 
in a lullaby  
artificial ‘til the day you die  
silly programme 
you’re corrupted!  
get the fuck up  
wake the fuck up  
wipe the system 
& back the fuck up.  
you’re a puppet  
when they cut your strings off  
don’t come crawling back  
you’re on your own.  
 
さあ 時の 
扉を開けて 
行こうよ 

(now, let’s go 
and open the door of time) 

kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky 
kingslayer  
i’ll fight for you until i die  
kingslayer  
destroying castles in the sky  
kingslayer  
forevermore the apple of my eye  
i’d sacrifice it all to guide you  
never have to battle alone  
kingslayer  
come and collect us from the night  
this is your wake up call  
we’re going down the rabbit hole  
are you ready?  
i can’t feel you.  
is this what you want?  
this is what you’ll fucking get.

#UFC",2367,"The fact that Wonderboy knows all these kids by name speaks to the type of person he is
Always rooting for Wonderboy. He’s a great role model, love seeing him teach the kids karate.
If the UFC made a show about Wonderboy just living his life being super wholesome I'd never miss an episode
Thompson is unreal... he does a full time job as a coach for kids and still maintains status as a top fighter
This was one of the most positive and happy embedded I've seen! Happy to see everyone is in good spirits for fight week. They'll need it for the presser
Such a heartwarming embedded. Even someone I’m not a fan of like Paddy, he’s a good dude at heart. Good to see.
I'm proud of wonderboy's facility for not only teaching these kids how to fight, but ensuring that they get their homework done.
Wonderboy is seriously an absolute class act. It’s honestly crazy how humble and genuine he is
1:23 I respect Wonderboy so much🥋💯. He knows to his core all his skills took time, years & years of honing. What he’s teaching these children & by simply picking them up from school? A world class fighter!!! You have no idea the dreams your building into those young minds. We all got in this art from watching movies. I can’t imagine a world class welterweight taking me to training🙌🏾🙌🏾🥋🥋🥋💯💯💯
Since everyone is talking about how great Wonderboy is…. 

Right after the Luque fight, I ran into him at Disneyland. I was a single rider on the Smuggler’s Run ride, and ended up with him and his family. I was so stoked! I told him my wife can’t ride because she is with my 2 year old son, and he said “well, you’re part of our family for this ride now!”

After the ride we talked about his fight and  came over and met my wife and son. He was seriously the nicest guy I’d ever met! It was something I’ll never forget.
Wonderboy really is that dude. Great human being
Why can’t Wonderboy be like 20 so we could keep watching him be him for another 20 years?… he’s one of the nicest guys on the planet, and one of the most entertaining fighters ever
The fact wonder boy is a top 5 welterweight and is doing all this is the most wholesome and cool thing I’ve ever seen
We need more fighters like Wonderboy in gyms everywhere. A good man is hard to find.
Brandon Royval and Stephen Thompson seem like genuinely good guys/role models. Really nice to see that.
Paddy gets a lot of hate but you can tell he's a genuinely good person based on his enthusiasm when interacting with that fan ❤
I’m rooting for Royval and Edwards! 
But it ain’t going to be easy 😤
What a great card to end the year.
Paddy’s honestly a great dude. Fighter or not, the guys got my admiration.
I know UFC doesn't wanna take the focus away from their Fight Night cards, but you really should build up these big PPV events for more than just a week. Hype usually takes a bit of time to build properly.
Wonderboy has always been a treat on embedded, he's a true role model of what a martial artist should be, he's so humble, true class act 👏👏👏👏",17,Sports,17300000,PT8M43S

good bye large cameraman your heroic act will never be forgotten :(
This series never disappoints, Cool
Looks like the cameraman found the skibidi lab bases! Sound like this is gonna be an interesting episode!
Mad respect for The Large cameraman. He risked his life for recording 67 from 1-4. Now  he is in peace. You will be remembered man
Press F to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman
Rest in peace large cameraman 
You were loved and you helped the cameraman find the factory and protected everyone 
You will be missed
Gran cámaraman tiene mis respetos murió como un gran guerrero que hasta el final protegió a sus compañeros si dudar 🖤
Rest in peace,large cameraman. You've Been a brave soldier,you Will never be forgotten👍
Presione F para presentar sus respetos al camarógrafo grande. Él era el punto de vista del episodio 67. Merece respeto por sacrificarse.
Agora sim o DaFuqBoom se surpreendeu no roteiro, deixou os Titãs de lado e mostrou o que os personagens secundários são capazes, os personagens vão morrendo aos poucos na fábrica dos Skibidis, isso é insano e tenso, epica luta a desse episódio
This almost made me cry. RIP Large Cameraman + RPG. He will always be remembered and be in our hearts. We only got to see him in the previous episode. Same as 66 also. With his last lives, He still did a thumbs up still in pain.😢
*respect to that large cameraman. rest in peace*
Dafuq, as I didn't see almost anyone talking, I'm going to say... You probably won't see this video, but it doesn't matter, I'm sending my strength to you man, every time I go into the comments I see people talking about how the video is or So saying that you are no longer the same. ""I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS SECOND IS ALL OF THEM."" But anyway, I came to leave a message supporting you and thanking you for everything you do for us, and for what you have to go through with rude comments, I don't know how you are behind that screen, but I hope you are well, they will probably tell me If anyone sees this, you deserve a rest, man, take a few weeks or months of vacation to improve your mind and your humanity, go out with your friends, and go to a place to rest your mind... Well, I just said that because I'm really worried about your psychology, all the work you do when it comes to being private, motherfucker, saying skibidi skibidi all the time, and in return getting insults that you're not the same anymore... that's it, probably. No one will read this but it's here, now I'm less worried.
What i love about episode 68, is that it now focuses on 2 parts of the story, one focuses on the 3 titans trying to find and defeat the gman toilet and the other focuses on infiltrating the base

also, R.I.P large cameramen
gotta be a real tragic day in the skibidi verse since we lost the big cameraman may he rest in peace
2 minute silence for large cameraman and large speaker man rest in peace guys and dont let the alliance down
Dude, the large characters are THE underappreciated heroes, seeing as the large speakerman died, then the large cameraman, that might mean that large TV man is next on the chopping block. RIP large cameraman.
Wow. Inspiring, to say the least. A year ago today I was standing on a 351-849 mile long sandwich 🥪 (which, too be fair, had no mustard) and was about to eat it all 😅. This video, along with the tuna song saved me. ❤
RIP both large speakerman and large cameraman, you both fought well until this far. Press F to pay respect to both large speakerman and large cameraman",24,Entertainment,36400000,PT2M40S

#Drumeo #NandiBushell #TwistedSister",1839,"Thank you so much @drumeo for inviting me on! I had the best time!
AJ Pero was a criminally underrated drummer.  Lots of people are unaware at how good he really was.
A great fresh version of a classic.

Her innocence when she says - I like how they all dressed up for the video.
Keep rocking, Nandi! Great work! 🙏🏼
If you want to try this and many other drumless songs, get a 7-Day Free trial to check out Drumeo! 👉🏼 http://www.drumeo.com/trial
she's 1000x better at this age then I'll ever be in my life.  So much talent and work
Absolutely blown away by the incredible drumming skills of this young drummer! It's truly impressive to witness such talent at such a young age. I can only dream of reaching her level of mastery on the drums. The precision, timing, and energy she brings to her performance are truly remarkable. A true inspiration for aspiring drummers like myself!
She effin' killed it!  Her interpretation of the cowbell was amazing!  I was super impressed.  I'm not as surprised now, to see how Foo Fighters identified her skill... so long ago.  This was incredible.  No offense to Twisted Sister... but, I think she really turned it up to ""11"".
That was phenomenal. You can see how Nandi's taken all of the lessons from Chad Smith and Dave Grohl to heart. So happy to hear her keeping rock alive. I'd say her drums worked better in places than the original track, she had more fills and had some double kick in places. One of the best in this series.
This was both adorable and jaw droppingly impressive at the same time. Beyond having great chops she also shows a good understanding of song structure and how to drive a song forward 👏
Her talent just shines in this video.  What a great take on that song.
Her approach brings such a late 90s/early 00s pop-punk vibe to the whole song. If that version were released in that era, it still would have been a hit.
What I love about Nandi and seeing her play is how enthusiastic she is. You can see the passion oozing alongside that skill and talent she possesses. Makes me all emotional watching her in her element like that!
I love her inclination to gallop the cymbals and hi-hat, that makes for really fun drums to listen to especially when it's metal.
She is so impressive with not only how she plays, which is outstanding, but also just how she handles everything being thrown at her so effortlessly.
AJ is smiling down at this. Best series hands down. She's so effin talented 👏🏼👏🏼
Nandi is so awesome!!! What an incredible talent and seems like such a sweet kid. This was pure joy!!!
I gotta say….this was amazing! Nandi killed it on the drums and never heard the song before! WOW! Wow! Wow! 🤘🔥🙌🥁
I’m so psyched to see Nandi on here.  Love her drumming, love her energy, this is an amazing performance.  So many little things match up with her version and the original.  Can’t wait to see more of Nandi here!  I know the guys of Twisted Sister will love this.
Nandi has come a long way from her drum battle with Dave Grohl. I'm very impressed she's got a very mature way of playing where she keeps very digestible yet compelling fills that don't overwhelm the overall song. Great work from her and I think once her GCSE's and A Levels are done she should definitely hit the road with a band that she and her peers create if they do create one.
I like the way Nandi is already a better drummer than most 80s hair metal bands ever had.",27,Education,3310000,PT9M40S

Jimmy could never do this... 
iykyk
That transformation from Ethan and Simon shaking from pain to Harry and Josh casually eating breakfast was top tier
Ethan & Simon: trying their best.
Tobi & JJ: Suffering
Harry & Josh: happy wholesome couple having fun.
Tobi and JJ getting driven around just to go back to Man vs Food is so funny 😭
Props to Ethan and Simon for suffering through those unholy wings, sacrifices that did not go unnoticed
The cut between Ethan and Simon suffering and Josh and Harry enjoying themselves was quality 😂
go hard or go home 🔥
Shoutout too all the sidemen for giving a legit effort for the challenges and content. Y’all killed this
The cut from Simon and Ethan tweaking to Josh and harry enjoying life is everything 😂
The JJ / Tobi pairing is underrated. Tobi definetly brings our a calmer side to JJ and JJ brings out a more joker side to Tobi
This was an awesome video. It's one thing to watch BeardMeatsFood absolutely crush these challenges, but it's even better watching two normal guys try to tag team one. It makes what BeardMeatsFood does way crazier, but there's something more interesting about watching normal people struggle their way through it.
I love how Harry exposes the concept of this video about an hour in.
I would have liked to see this be 3 challenges over 3 days, i'm not sure how else they thought this would go down.
Also, food waste was inevitable, glad Harry gave the pizza out.
Tobi and JJ had me laughing so hard the entire video 😂 This is quality content.
Ethan saying he’s a professional eater while having something stuck to the front of his tooth killed me I can’t stop laughing I just wanna tell him

Magnus explained football and chess perfectly. Even PEP was shocked there
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to host / be in the same room as these two geniuses!  😀🤝
GOATs
Pep was clearly impressed when Magnus was speaking. The eyes say it all
You can tell Pep enjoyed this. He looked so deep in thought when Magnus was speaking.
This is such an insane crossover, as both a Man City fan and a lover of chess. 

All the best at the currently ongoing CCT to Magnus. Vamos. 💯
it's rare that someone impresses pep. You clearly see magnus caught peps attention within the first 10 sec when Pep crossed his arms and touched his face.
Incredible hearing Magnus speak about the similarities between chess and football
For those who don't know much about chess, let me tell you that Magnus is the strongest chess player who has ever lived. He gave up his World Championship because he believed there was no adversary that could beat him in a WC match. And no one argued against it.
He's not only the greatest chess player of all time, but also was briefly ranked world no 1 in 2019 in Premiere League fantasy football
A Football Genius, A Chess World Champion and Pep Guardiola all in the same room😮‍💨

Mega stuff FG x
Without Riyad in that movement everything would not be possible. He still thanks and praises him What a coach
i love the way magnus is trying to simplify chess concepts for pep. magnus knows more football compared to how pep knows chess. As a chess and football fan lots for respect for both. I JUST LOVE THIS 12 MINUTE VIDEO WISH IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN HOUR.
Look how happy is Magnus to be there and talk about this. 
I think he feels on the same wave and mindset as Pep. Great chemistry and duo 😊
bravo to the host for asking great questions and allowing these two geniuses to share their wisdom uninterrupted.

it's common to see hosts who do too much and end up imposing themselves onto a video like this, really nice to see one who gets it.
The best interview I have seen in both sports. What an insane explanation Magnus gave to the resemblance of football and chess, the look on Pep's face says it all. Lastly the interviewer was just amazing, great questions, solid handling of two pure geniuses. Very very enjoyable to watch and what a nice unexpected collision of two legends.
We want more of Pep and Magnus collab! Or a much longer interview.
Let's make these two brainstorm something 😊
It's was so unexpected, but quite a pleasant surprise, nonetheless, to see these 2 guys I admire so much together

Tommy being British and wearing American outfit is the last thing I expected to see in 2023
Tommy went to his own character settings, changed his nationality to american and the patriotism to 100%
The moment Tommy steps foot into America is the moment his personality completely shifts into a different person and it stays that way when he gets back
I’m glad you found a new desire for comedy through your shows, idk how you managed all this before graduating college but good job dude
I can’t express how happy I am for you, seeing you come this far in the content creator community, it’s just incredible. 
My only regret is that I live in Asia :,)
As an Australian living in Australia, I’m seriously crying right now.
as an american who genuinely almost flew to the uk to watch your tour, i am quite thankful for this opportunity to not spend money on a plane ticket and instead the hour drive to chicago and milwaukee!! cant wait to see you there tommy!
Tommy, this is crazy. Congrats on all the success!
Genuinely so proud of you tommy, everything you’ve managed to achieve before you’re even 20 yo is amazing
I’m so proud of you 🎉
The next step is hopefully going to be Europe and I hope I can see you there!
i've been a fan of tommy for five years today . five years ago today , i subscribed to him and became a fan . seeing him make it this far makes me so happy because i truly don't know anyone else who deserves all of this more than him . congratulations tommy , u deserve it all . 💕
This is not the world I know. Please get me back to my reality where Tommy is british, thank you.
I guess this means Tommy is going to pursue the American Dream, congrats Tommy
I’m not usually a fan of live shows, the noise and crowds stress me out quite alot but for the first time in years I think I might want to go see one, I just hope that it’s not too crowded, and by that I mean I hope that the thousands of people who inevitably show up don’t scream their lungs off constantly
I’m so proud of him, he’s come so far
What an inspiring story of a young man escaping the darkest pits of hell and coming to the land of opportunity
if i dont get tickets i might explode lmao ❤ so proud of you for discovering and following what you wanna do. keep it up king we all love you
Okay, SERIOUSLY, I'm really proud of our big man Tom Simons, he's done so fucking well that I'm literally crying rn. I'm so sad I'm not American rn.. and as an Argentinian from Argentina, I'll literally give a liver and some ribs to go see Tommy live.

I've always been too afraid to play this and I'm happy to report that nothing has changed after seeing this trailer 😭

I can imagine how Matpat is excited over this trailer and of course, THE LOOOORE!

❤ love to see they are in the streets that are accessible for everyone who is around ❤
Hi Allie, Do you recognize the little Allie from back then in little Fionn? It's so sweet that you're doing a duet with him and that you are now sharing your experiences from seven years of busking! And you both sang that eulogy to Shane McGowan so brilliantly! 😍
Allie Sherlock is fantastic in everything she does, she is the wonder of the world
Allie Sherlock is so generous to share her time with Fionn! I think he can learn a lot from her. They sound lovely together! They both are loaded with talent! Thanks for sharing!
I so look forward for the duets of Allie and Fionn. Please-more!  Bravo! Such a wonderful song. Such beautiful voices.
❤❤❤❤❤ Comme c'est beau, quels beaux artistes! Merci d'être là, avec nous. C'est un vrai bonheur! ❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing performance. Both of you, sounded great, together. Bravo.
Magically beautiful 💚 thank you- RIP Shane 🍀
Allie, your talent is undeniable and continues to give other talents the opportunity to always succeed. ❤
When you hear it for the first time, it's sorta creepy, but his laugh was the most endearing laugh that there was. The most genuine and gentle soul ever in rock music. RIP.  Thank you Allie for singing his song so beautifully as usual. In one word, you are perfect.
That kid was amazing!!!
Very nice song and excellently played. Thank you very much.❤❤❤❤❤😊
Dva irska muzicka dijamanta, bravisimo 😊
Talent attracts talent!🤘👍
It's too cold to sing in the streets. Their vocal cords need more heat. Bravo.❤
Fabulous  ❤ anytime I am in Dublin I just smile in awe at her talent.  Also the young kid is amazing.

I'm an American and I must say, the Wales family are a breath of fresh air.
I really love how George and Charlotte and Louis work together to help their mother pack and carry things! It's very rare for me to see something like this! And the first time I saw this video, I feel extraordinary closeness and warmth in the Welsh family ❤ thanks for sharing this video!
If all parents took their time to educate their children like this we would have a better world!!!
This is really a great initiative! We would like also to inform everyone that we collected thousands of 9O off codes for this month. Make sure to get some.
This is so wonderful. Catherine teaching her children at a young age to give back. I love that they took boxes out of their car to give as well.
Catherine is a great teacher to her children…simple as that!  Just having them aware of other human beings, like themselves.
This is such a wonderful, caring video.  Princess Catherine bringing her children to volunteer helping with the huge job of sorting of dividing the donations for families in need.  Not only have they learned the positive lesson of volunteering, but more importantly, they are learning about the thousands of children and families who are struggling and will be so happy to receive this loving outpouring of support from their communities during the holidays. The Wales children are caring and loving just like their wonderful parents.  💖
Got very emotional watching how down to earth the Wales family are. Catherine PRINCESS of Wales emits beauty from within.
The interactions between herself the children, and the people surrounding her 
Is genuine and regal. 
💕The children are so naturally well behaved. May God bless them. The Wales family is built on solid foundations and stability.
How can you not love this family❤️ Kudos to the Prince and Princess of Wales for raising well adjusted children! They are doing an amazing job!
Love how “ George wants to come back”! Yes momma, train them to serve and care about others!
The fact that the children behave so well and so politely is all due to their parents.
Great mother, great wife, and great future Queen of the UK. Princess Catherine works hard to carve out her own roles and create her own style of doing things. It is never ""look at me, ain't I a great humanitarian;"" we can see her humility, dedication, steadfastness of purpose, and tremendous hard work. Thank you Catherine; we are lucky to have you and your family.
What a wonderful mother teaching her children the value of giving back to others and recognizing those in need. There is not a greater gift than compassion for others, and while I am sure Catherine and William teach many private lessons on selflessness at home, it is good to see George, Charlotte and Louis in action. No doubt these children will live lives of service and respect for all.
The Wales children are absolutely wonderful!!!  So are their parents.
Catherine is an amazing mum. Educating her children to show respect and compassion for others who have far less than they do.  The royal children do it so carefully and considerately. They are an inspiration. ❤
So wholesome. A great example for everyone.
👩🏻‍💻It is so good to see Catherine, the Princess of Wales taking her children and teaching them to serve. I got my kids to plan and prepare a meal to give to one a family having a new baby. When they learn to serve when they are young the children grow to be empathic and compassionate and to look around outside themselves. It is so good to see such an excellent example of guiding her children and being a leader for the world.
🙋‍♀️😘🥰🇺🇲🇬🇧
What a simple message - to get out there and help, in any way!  It is good to see the future royals learning how to help.  In the US, we have a few organizations, one is Toy for Tots.  Police Dept's , Fire Dept's all get involved, as do individuals to help out.    There are many other organizations too:  for single parents, for runaway teens, for the animals, and those in hospitals - so many ways to get involved -   :)
Ik they're being filmed, but that literally brought tears to my eyes how cute those kids are and what a nice thing they'e doing.  It's so great that the princess of wales includes her children in these charities.  And actually a great idea to have them pick out the toys for kids their age.",22,People & Blogs,659000,PT1M51S

Such beautiful visuals yet very Doctor Who. A good and necessary reboot to keep the show fresh. Can't wait.
Incredible trailer. I signed up for Disney+ just for this show. Can't wait to see the 15th Doctor
A exciting future is ahead. The reboot looks amazing. The technology has cranked the show up 100 notches. Can’t wait for Xmas day
Oh this is so good.! Great job to everybody involved in production. Can’t wait to see this special.! Also this is giving very fantastical Disney vibes. I CANT WAIT.! ❤❤
So he gonna meet her after saving her as baby when she was abandoned. Well that what The Doctor does and is about. He a hero. Going to love The 15th Doctor and Ruby Sunday to.
I haven't been this excited about New Who since Matt Smith was the Doctor. I think they're going to be great!
WHAT A TRAILER! This looks amazing, Xmas needs to get here already
So when I heard they were going fantasy more than science fiction I have to admit didn’t think they would start with Xmas episode with goblins……or are they alien goblins?
From what we've seen so far, I think Ncuti is going to be an amazing Doctor. Enjoyed the hell out of the 3 specials and can't wait for this one.
The Doctor and Ruby are gonna slay ❤❤➕🟦
Man even after hearing all the leaks seeing this really made me feeling like this is going to be really fun! See you all in 2 weeks! 🎉
Along with the quality of production and with having an amazing new doctor with a great companion, who already have great chemistry together is making me very very excited for the future of Doctor Who
I cant wait! The 60th Specialists were great. It will be interesting to see what an emotionally healed Doctor looks like. Ncuti has so much charm
So excited for this! Looks amazing!! Bring on Christmas Day!
I can already tell I'm going to love Ruby.

That 0-0 to Bournemouth, had me dying inside 😂😂 almost spit my water out in the gym
Broskis, this show was GOLD! Honestly proud how far this platform has came, plenty of clips from that debate between Turkish and Hughie and Grizz, constant quality 👊🏽💯 love from Oxford 🇬🇧
Nah this is easily the best episode so far this season. The cooking sessions were all on point! Top work guys, always elevating! 🙏🏾
It has to take The Arsenal getting involved for the title race to be truly entertaining. This is one of THE best big six shows of all time and it’s because we’re going neck and neck with City & L’pool. Mah, Tobs and Saeed stirring everything nicely in the background as well 😂
53:15 that Saeed exit was quicker than Henry at his peak
Matisse got absolutely fried!! The September 17th tweet literally had me on the floor! Great show!! 🤣

1:54:35 underrated Saeed quote im my opinion that was missed! 🤣
When we say this is the BEST SHOW ON YOUTUBE no cap is involved.. big up the whole team.👏🏾 that Mah cooking was insane 😂😂.
This channel deserves so many more subs!! Great content as ever! Keep it up lads 👏🏻👏🏻
The show was a masterclass show. Absolutely smashed it all you guys are legends man. The panel compliments each other perfectly. The matisse cooking was mad😂.
The matisse segment killed me 😂 I was walking to work and couldn't stop smiling. I had to pause the video just so I wouldn't burst out laughing.
This was the most fun I’ve had watching any big six episode 😂! Top class lads
This was one of best shows. Michelin star cooking of Matisse. Great instigating by Saeed and Mah to get Turkish and Hugh at each others neck. Hugh is clearly settled in now and seems like he has moved to South London. Grizz and Tobs taking great pleasure in being rude to each other.

Too show.
Tobi's cooking of Matisse was literal GOLD 🤣 those tweets have come back to haunt him expeditiously !
Great episode. Fantastic intro video by skull. Had me creasing 😂 and the Matisse cooking .. especially the 0-0 to Bournemouth had me lol’ing
This was a diamond episode with Matisse getting roasted! 🤣🤣🤣 I was on the floor",24,Entertainment,48800,PT2H22M40S

Thank you for making my home feel safe again! Love and miss you guys!

I do not allow any negative energy or spirits or anything else to come around me or anyone I love while watching these videos. Thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything yall do
I am really glad that Colby decided to say his fear out loud because I've been struggling with the same one for the last few years. It's nice to know someone out there is also feeling uneasy because of this.. makes me feel less alone.
Honestly, Colby is so real for having that fear. It's definitely one you don't really think about, but most of us probably have.
Wildlife biologist here! That hissing in the shack sounded like an opossum to me :) other animals like marmots will hiss like that (a gutteral hiss, not the silkiness of a snake hiss). It was probably looking for bugs or rodents and upset you disturbed its hunt. ❤
Imagine being a ghost and seeing the bathtub full of water and getting all excited to take yourself a little ghostly soak so you turn the jets on and suddenly everyone freaks out 🤣
I am not claiming any negative energy from this video and i dont want this to be spreading to me or my loved ones throughout watching series thank you so much for listening to our side of the story
Me, my family and my loved ones do not claim any negative energy or spirits from the video. I am praying that all of you guys watching the video will stay safe and protected!

Am I the only one who was so engrossed and entertained watching them together, that when they pulled the curtain back and Sam jumped up (even though I KNEW something silly was about to happen) I still literally jumped, screamed, and then laughed so freakin hard at myself!! No? Just me?? Lmao.
Celina, I’m really glad you’re bringing the people who are sensitive to certain things into a positive light. I’ve been struggling with my gift since I was little and it regularly scares me some people don’t get how it effects people. Shit sucks sometimes. I’ve been following you for years and I’m proud of you. I’m still afraid to address my shenanigans even though multiple mediums have read me and called me out. Fun fact I grew up in a house in Maine with shadow people. Yes that is plural unfortunately. My mom can attest to that one it was Terrifying. this video is full of goofy sh!t tho
I do not allow any negative energy or spirits, or anything else to come around me or the one's i love while watching this series thank you for letting us hear your story. Thank you guys for everything you do. I'm sorry if i nade any glances or anything i shouldn't have.
Guys! I felt the energy off that banishing ritual! Powerful stuff! As a witch (and a fellow ghost investigator), I'm giving you all virtual high-fives! Ya did good!

BRAVO to the audience, and above all BRAVO TO DR K for continuing to play in the face of adversity !!!

Well done Brendan. You single handedly defused a large group of security and a friendly police force. Have they nothing better to do ?
Hats off to the police woman, what a legend. I hope network rail management see this video and read the comments!
Now, here in Western Australia, we always thought that ""public pianos"" were there to encourage people to play.  Age old story - give a ""small"" man some power and it will go straight to their heads.  The bobbies did a great job.  Well done DrK.  From a retired copper. Merry Christmas.

Ahhh. Security doing their best NPC impressions as usual. Bunch of useful idiots, unable to read a situation. Well played, Brendan!
Security people need to wise up and catch themselves on. Taking issue with you Brendan is a total disgrace. You bring nothing but delight to people. How dare they.
And then those mighty  and tough but miserable security guards  slopped away and dissapeared silently ,  hahahaha   
       THANK YOU  ELLA !!!!!!
People of the world, we have indeed lost it. I mean wtf? Face this way, that way. You play, no play? Coppers and security for a man and a piano. Hilarious 😂😂😂
Musicians often have a hard life. Instead of getting paid for such high quality performance, he has to be glad not being banned or arrested. Simply ridiculous. Greets and admiration from Germany.

You go Branden ! Rock Rock.. what a miserable security !! Keep playing!!

What you need is a breakfast you can get ready, for the most part, before you go to bed on Christmas Eve, and that makes you greet the day – and your guests – the next morning with a genuine smile on your face.

Step forward please, breakfast trifle! A tangy, fruity layer-up of sponge fingers, clementine-spiked berries and lightly whipped yoghurt and cream, this is neither as elaborate nor as rich as your traditional Christmas trifle: the effort is minimal, the result luscious.

And if it’s a savoury start you’re looking for, do check out my Breakfast Strata (the title referring to the layers), which is really a cheesy, eggy bake with bread at the heart of it: https://youtu.be/eA-8AlFVekQ

Both recipes will help set you up for a stress-free, joyful start to the day, even if you’ve been up late filling stockings and frantically wrapped presents.”

Happy for DC, he put a lot of effort into building up this team, glad he got to drive their best car to this date
For all the work DC has done for RB to lay the foundation for what it is today, he absolutely deserves to experience such masterpiece of machinery. Now I wanna see Newey, Webber, and Vettel in the RB19 as well
DC is one of the smartest, funniest and most knowledgeable lads around, and it's an absolute joy to watch every time he does coverage for F1. It's so amazing to see him tear up the track like an absolute pro!
Red Bull is kind of company which takes a good care of its drivers, Sebastian Buemi and DC are still under RB's payroll, Mark Webber had RB money in his pocket years after he retired from F1, the company still supports Marc Marquez in MotoGP despite he's been riding for rival teams since RB-KTM partnership and Alex Albon during 2022 season in Williams had it as personal sponsor, he separated from RB just because the nature of Mercedes-Williams cooperation.
Kudos to Red Bull, I wish we had more sponsors like it.
Lovely seeing that Scottish flag on the RB19's monocoque. DC is the reason why I ever watched F1 in the first place & why I follow this team 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏆
Thank you, Red Bull and Christian, for letting DC take a lap in a truly beautiful, powerful, dominant, and awe-inspiring machine!
It's a shame he only got one lap. I would have liked to see him get fully comfortable over the course of a day.
52 years old in an current gen era car is fantastic, you can see the old school early 2000s trackline approach 
Quite a reward from Horner to a person who was dare to left McLaren Mercedes and switched to a ""new"" team run by drink company and develop the car from not competitive into very dominating..
 
Also how people remember DC nowadays : ""Schumacher angry pitlane meme""
I have a huge amount of respect for DC he helped this team go forward, and i think the team know this
DC is hands down the most likeable person in F1. You just cannot hate this man, an absolute legend!
The whitty humor of DC, LOVE IT 😂😂😂 And the comeradery within the team is so wonderful to see. How Liam fits right in. GP there. This was filmed on DR’s tyre testing day at Silverstone I think, few days after Silverstone GP. That’s why Horner was there too. I just love the humor and the fun RBR has while working hard with full focus.
The guy that helped get Newey to RB, gets to drive some of Newey 's best work. Beautiful to see
David is such a great guy! He deserved this opportunity
""The cars are very easy to drive""
- Liam Lawson the man who replaced Ricciardo after he crashed, who replaced a De Vries that couldn't stop crashing.
Thanks DC and Red Bull for an ear to ear smile throughout.
Liam comes across as a thoroughly decent guy.
Not my team but they seem to promote a family feel.
Very enjoyable.
I've had the pleasure to work with DC on several occassions for these kinds of Red Bull productions. And he really is just as likeable, genuin, humble and professional in person as he comes across in the content. 
He gives everyone the same amount of respect and time. Such a gentleman!
DC was my favorite driver when I was a kid. I just loved something about him. And now, he is my favorite F1 promoter. He still looks to be in great shape, talks passionately and throws jokes all the time. Such a joy to watch him. So nice of RB to let him drive the current car for a change. He definitely deserved it.
Rest well RB19. Privileged to have seen you perform.
Hell of a car, Max is one hell of a driver, and cheers to the team for putting together the most historic Formula 1 season of all time.",17,Sports,1610000,PT6M59S

The Day Before will serve as a long remembered example of why marketing cannot be believed, and why Early Access video games are to be treated with caution.

#thedaybefore #scam #fntastic",1922,"The drama around this game was millions of times more entertaining than the game itself. I'm almost sad it's over. Seriously this is more like a crypto rug pull than a studio closure.
This was a total social experiment and in some ways quite hilarious to prove a point that people will buy trash and be happy.
The fact that hundreds of thousands of players actually bought such an obvious scam is the saddest part. Expect a lot more similar scams coming soon.
Most brain dead defenders of this game are like, it's not a scam, you got a 'product'.  Yes, when I buy Chevy Camero and they give me a Ford Festiva, I'm like, well they did give me a 'product'.
These trash and overhyped companies need to face multi-million dollar lawsuits for false advertising.
I get the blind optimism for a new unproven dev but these devs had a track record for abandoning games. 
It honestly feels like everywhere I look there is a scam.
This game was an AI generated social experiment to see how dumb modern gamers are
Four days. wow.
That has to be some kind of record. They didn't even TRY to hide it, that's how confident they were that they could get away with it. (And they pretty much have)
Four days... Unbelievable.
This is so blatantly a scam that I'm actually curious if this would qualify as criminal.
Like we all know that at least in America 'false advertising' will never actually be prosecuted, but this is so egregious that it might count as something like a pyramid or ponzi scheme... Also who wants to bet that those 'server issues' at launch were done intentionally as a way to force players into playing for more than 2 hours so they would struggle to get a refund?
As I said in other threads, they met their contractual agreement to release a game. They send their volunteers a boilerplate ""thank you"" email, pay their ""investors"" and whatever is left they'll pocket without legal ramifications. Can't get money from a stone so by closing up shop they're effectively immune to any further lawsuit since investors/creditors would likely get first dibs on whatever assets they have. 

They used the hype of TDB to generate a trickle of income through Prop Night to cushion their finances since you damn well know they put in like a week of work to develop for low investment cost to maximize whatever return it generates.

At this point Steam will likely step in and open up refunds for everyone who bought it regardless of hours played and reevaluate their method of allowing games to be put in their catalogue. 

They pretty much have to at this point.
It's been alleged that the map was indeed an asset flip - folks are claiming it was built using the $300 ""American City Packs (Bundle)"" which the sample images and video on the store compared to 95% of the in-game world would suggest is accurate. It's also been claimed that the game engine itself is a direct flip of the $65 ""Survival Game Kit V2"", which is where the in-game inventory mechanics all come from.
Modern game made for modern gamers.. you all deserve each other

This was so obvious from day 1. Too bad people still gave them money.
Watching this entire situation unfold over the course of the past years to the lead up now honestly I can’t fathom how people are actually defending an outright scam
Shit like this just further reinforces my current stance on gaming, which is that I almost never purchase a game on release and instead wait a few weeks to see what the *actual* product is instead of the dressed-up version seen in trailers and marketing.
Personally, I think that crap like this should get the people responsible for it blacklisted in the entire industry. These kinds of actions should never be allowed or supported, and the fact that so many bought into it is just depressing.
It would have been so much more epic if they did this the day after release.
Imagine if you were one of those volunteers thinking they had a hand in something great, and find out later the boss was scamming
This has been my favorite game for the last two years. Not because I was excited for it, but because it’s just been a rollercoaster of bad PR and terrible decisions that led to what everyone knew from the beginning -that this was a scam!
I will forever thank this game for providing us with some of the funniest (and much deserved) rant reviews on YouTube.  What the developers did sucks but I haven't laughed this much in years.  These reviews are priceless.",20,Gaming,673000,PT12M3S

In this Minecraft redstone video, we take a look at how to build giant Minecraft flying machines. Minecraft slimeblock flying machines have been a hobby of mine for years, and now I'm doing a Minecraft tutorial on how to build Minecraft flying machines. From simple minecraft flying machines, to adding complexities, to creating walking minecraft machines. This covers how to build a walking house in Minecraft, walking Minecraft robots, and more!

Mumbo, you should make a machine that retracts fence posts,
Just in case you’re being chased down by a warden 😂
I like Mumbo’s concept of a basic loop, and a “jumbled” loop. However, instead of jumbled loop, I think it should be called a Jumbo loop.
if it is soo simple, Get Grian and Scar to watch this video and watch them making flying machines
It is kinda funny to see how closely Mumbo’s three design rules parallel the design principles I’m learning as an engineering undergrad
I've never really gotten that into redstone, so I'm genuinely amazed that you explained it in such a way that it was easy to follow along! Flying machines always mystified me, but them being a loop of pushes and pulls makes *so* much sense! Kinda like a caterpillar when you think about it!
I love when we get Mumbo videos like these - feels like the balance between Theory and Tutorial that makes it really easy (for me personally) to synthesize understanding of how the circuitry works while still having a grand reference to work towards. It doesn't ruin the magic of how you make them; far from it, it brings that magic within a range of knowledge that we can actually understand HOW COOL YOUR STUFF IS.
yknow, for tight timing things like this, i would actually recommend getting either carpet mod - or recording in the 1.20 snapshots.
That way you'd have access to tick freeze and tick step, which would make these explanations even better imo!
This was actually really informative. I've built flying machines before and understood the basic ideas, but seeing it broken down and explained like this really helped me connect all the dots. Thank you, Mumbo :)
P.S. Cool Armadillo. I love the eyebrows.
you should use the new 1.20.3 /tick rate & /tick step commands to decrease the ticks and show a slowmotion of the flying machines in the video, would probably help alot
What you said at the end about flying machines being smaller principles all put together applies to so many things that you learn. Programming for example is just a bunch of different components put together. When you look at it from the top view you see all the smaller components but where it becomes tricky is putting them together to make something cool and unique. A person could make those smaller components by them self but it would take a lot more work and creativity to make a functioning, and cool looking, final product
The fact you can take something this crazy and simplify it down to a succinct video is honestly as impressive or more impressive than the original massive flying machine that your tank build was
Reminds me of clockwork. Certainly gears are simple at their core, but when combining them in large geartrains, the complexity increases. A lot of it is down to timing (speed) and torque. 

Fascinating.
From now on, every time Mumbo states that something is simple, we need grian to attempt and replicate it to verify that statement.
I've only watched as far at the fourth green rectangle, and I've already learned so much about these flying machines. Thank you so much, Mumbo!
Great video as always! Not sure if you've had a look at all the new snapshot features yet (besides the crafting bench), but the variable tick speed is really useful for showing/seeing block movement sequences and other tricky redstone stuff which can be hard to figure out when it happens so quickly.
The carpet mod (or even in vanilla since 1.20.3) adds the /tick command
This is extremely useful for testing since you can freeze the game, and then go one tick at a time and see exactly what's happening and when.
Incredibly informative. Grian and Scar can now fix Doc's giant tunnelbore just in time for the end of the season 😄
I think this makes the whole process so much cooler, even if in total it's fairly simple
Really cool to see the inner workings of how these seemingly complicated machines actually work!",20,Gaming,9260000,PT17M52S

Music by Kevin MacLeod: https://incompetech.com/",2540,"Missy is just literally the chillest creature out of everyone in this game. She’s so Kumbaya and I need that. I wish I had her energy
Given how Poppy is actually helping us throughout all of this, I do hope she won't become this final hidden main antagonist.
The fact that this guy made this video in less than 10 minutes is low-key respectable. 👏Great job man.
I actually theorize that we won't meet Catnap as this giant monster right away, but rather he would look very similar to his cartoon self and be the size of a normal cat. However, once he learns that Poppy apposes the Prototype, it is only then he takes on a more monstrous form. Keep in mind that Catnap can adjust the proportions of his body, he's a sizeshifter.
This game really went from being called not scary to actually being legitimately terrifying
The character that is being tortured and strapped is Dog-Day, the leader of the Smiling Critters. Dog-Day is also the one of the screenshot, coming out of a large tube. We see him chasing the player on the trailer as well, coming out of that same tube. I believe that the guy on the phone saying ""This is what he does to heretics."", etc, is Dr. Harley ""The Doctor"" Sawyer, from Project Playtime. I am not sure, but his voice is surely the same voice actor. The Dr. was also the one responsible for the monsters, the project being called: ""The Bigger Bodies Innitiative"".
The little critters were so cute in a creepy way. Seeing them with long, human sized limbs touched on an uncanny valley feel, for me, that made them look scarier than the plushie version. I also noticed the stitches on the arms. If they are working with the prototype, maybe it helped make them bigger/taller and safer. We know that small things can get brutalized by the bigger toys.
i'll be wearing 5 pairs of pants for this one i cant lie 🤣
The scratch on the wall fully says ""FATE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE"". Also. That character we see tied up actually looks like the dog. It has the same ears and if you look closely, that bottom part of face is its chin and you can see the top of its smiling mouth. This character looks really close to the dog and i wonder if it was tortured into finding us or if it was tortured for not catching us. Or maybe there are more than one prototype of all those characters seeing that there are many on the statue and this prototype of the dog didnt want to do as told. Also the detailed pic of the dog has cuffs on its wrists. Making me believe more into the fact that he was either tortured into finding us or tortured for not catching us.
I think 19:01 says ""PEACE AWAITS THOSE WHO BELIEVE."" I'm really excited for the game though! Thank you for always getting the content out quickly for us, Mike!
Chapter 3 is lookin very good so far! Also massive props to Mob Entertainment, just shows how much care and effort they put into their games and story, just can’t wait to see it now! XD
Man I can't even imagine what the chase sequences we are going to see CatNap, and something tells me that this is going to be the SCARIEST chapter ever
My theory on Nightmare Huggy is that it's the same one from chapter one, but under the influence of Catnap, who saw how obedient Huggy had been to the prototype and allowed him to live and serve the prototype again - through Catnap's orders.
just watched the trailer myself and it looked like all the  critters  went 'wild'  or rabid.  The fact that poppy called the prototype the bad is intersting. Cant wait to see  who's the real bad guy or something
Given how much information is in this next chapter, I wonder if this is the last chapter of the game or maybe they'll do one more and then end the game. It seems like we're going to learn about most of the secrets behind this place in the chapter so I would assume a forth chapter would be about our escape or helping the toys or defeating the prototype. (Also I just thought of this, but it's possible the player is a toy themselves. If they were a bigger bodies toy, they would be working in the factory, have knowledge of the experiments and have been wronged)
One of the biggest things I cannot wait for, is seeing how the player and Poppy interact with Kissy. But why do I have this strange feeling, like red flags are being raised, that she’ll sacrifice herself to save Poppy and the player and never be seen again after this upcoming chapter?

Idk, I’d be happy if Kissy lived, but I guess we will have to wait and see.
Yo, the voice lines from Poppy, it sounds so chilling. She’s actively trying to save people? And KISSY MISSY, yes!!! I knew she would be involved, that would actually be so cool. I really really hope this ends up with us actually saving people, not just “you were secretly the bad guy”
one important aspect is that the smiling cirtters or atleast catnap are made entirely of a special fluid material that gives them the ability to manifest their form. they can be as small as a mouse, or as tall as a giraffe
Knowing kissy will help us in this chapter, I can’t help but fathom that she’ll probably face off against against catnap near the end of the chapter to maybe buy us some time to escape.
Geez, Catnap is huge and awesomely and genuinely terrifying. And seeing Kissy and Poppy helping us is very interesting",20,Gaming,2110000,PT21M8S

So much so that the studio shutdown and is likely running with the money...

Special thanks to @BigfryTV for his gameplay
HollyRex's clip https://www.twitch.tv/hollyrex/clip/BombasticHyperAlmondItsBoshyTime-YK9Mh_v-W17bk6cM",2684,"Steam has taken the game down.  You can no longer buy it.  Apparently Steam also holds money for 30 days.  They're also allowing refunds no matter how long you have played.  So it looks like the developers jumped ship too early.
Luckily! Steam is accepting refunds for players past the 2 hour mark. This was too much of a Scam even for Steam.
Players and valve should put these guys in court
One thing I have learned over the years is ""there are people defending it"" means absolutely nothing in the world of video games.    They love abuse.
What people have to learn:
NEVER believe trailers. 
NEVER pre-oder anything.
Wait till the game is fully released.
This is one of those cases where we need to make it publicly visible who the scammers are that worked on (Or rather orchastrated) this game. So people will know if these scumbags decide to just make a new development team and try the same shit again
Not to mention Fntastic used ""volunteers"" in their development process. They asked people to help develop their game and in exchange the volunteers received ""participation certificates"" and ""free codes"" for the game. Every single stage of development had the stench of shady grifter all over it.
The fact that the studio literally said, “shit happens” is ….wow
Level- “I gotta give some credit to the devs because what they put together isn’t that easy.”
*Seconds later*
Also Level- “Random guy on Reddit is recreating the game by himself.” 😂 💀
I remember watching you when I was in middle school and you made airsoft videos! I’m happy to see you’re still at it man keep up the hard work 🔥
Imagine if they released the source code for the community to use the foundation to make the game it was supposed to be.
Keep an eye on The Ranchers, it was announced at TGA a year ago and is going down the same route - even after a successful kickstarter.
I have a feeling this will not be the last time this happens. regardless of whether or not Fntastic is actually in the red or not, other people will see this as an possiblt opportunity. expect to see people learning from the errors made by Fntastic and performing scams better. keep an eye out everyone, do NOT buy any new game from a new and unknown developer until you see content creators review it and give the all clear. be cautious and stay safe, and hopefully this trend will die before it takes flight
The frustrating thing about this is that consumers were told in no uncertain terms by practically all the gaming media that this was a scam. This was made clear for them for pretty much a year before release. Yet they bought it anyway. It's pretty hard to imagine they could have missed all the negative coverage that was out there over that length of time.
My biggest issue is I was keeping an eye on this and planned to get it for my self. But every video and trailer I watched I kept sitting there feeling like this was a cash grab and dont touch it. But the cinematic trailers they did it looked great
I always follow the rule of: If it looks and sounds too good to be true. It probably is. Especially when they never show real in game footage.
The gaming community should keep an eye on these people. Apparently they have a secondary studio or already changed their name to Eight Points. I feel they'll continue their scam practices until they are demanded or something in the legal pathway of things
Been appreciating your efforts since BF3.  Thank you for what you do.
Imagine if 10 legitimate developers like that guy joined on to make that parody. I bet they could have a functional game out in about 6 months to a year. That’s making the game actually playable and improving on things too.
I think this is a good thing, long term, for consumers. If this doesn't get people to wise up and quit shelling out money for games without a good idea of what they're getting (something with a lot of third-party gameplay videos) then there's no hope for video gamers.",20,Gaming,1940000,PT10M53S

and do check out Auto Reserve for your Jaguar spares: https://www.autoreservejaguar.com/",453,"The reason Jag would have quoted £2600 for the subframe will be mainly labour. In this situation you really need to take the subframe out of the car, remove all rust down to bare metal and then paint/waxoyl it while its out of the car. What you've done is basically put a rust proof layer on top of rust. This will stop new moisture getting into the subframes metal, but it won't stop the rust you left from spreading underneath the coating. So it will look all nice and new, but the metal will continue to deteriorate.
Jack, next time you polish headlights, I recommend putting masking tape on the paint around the lights first, as it's easy to accidentally polish through the paint on the edges of the panels.  it lets you see if you're going past the edge of the light too often, and gives the paint a touch of protection before it starts to burn off.
The headlights will need a coat of UV resistant lacquer to last, else you'll need to polish them again in 12-18 months as they will go cloudy again. No biggie, but worth getting them coated in my personal opinion.
Personally I'd have put a neutraliser on the rusty sub-frame to prevent corrosion coming back under the waxoil.  I also always put copper ease on wheel bolts and the hub facing surfaces; does make life easier thereafter.  Looks like it's turning into a really usable and still gorgeous car.
It's great to see you back on the spanners, Jack! As much as I love your reviews, this content is what it's all about 👍
I would've personally put some rust converter on the subframe as all you've done with the wax oil is lock in the rust which will make it worse long term. I see it all the time. You need to get rid of the rust first.
If you have to attack the lights again, please use tape around the surrounding bodywork.
Great result and just shows how much you can save on dealer quotes. However, I think the subframe refurb is a bit misleading, as you've only really (so it would seem) got the crap off and sealed the bits you can physically get to. You would really need to drop it and take off all the ancillary bits to do it properly. Just sayin'.
If you don't already, I suggest only using single hex sockets on those kind of wheel nuts. Double hex ones can damage the this shells and they turn or get stuck in the socket. 
Found this out the hard way!!
Similarly I'd avoid using an impact wrench to undo or tighten them as it will break them with no warning. Use a socket and bar to undo and a torque wrench to tighten.
The subframe/suspension “fix” is very temporary.
Not bad to do and it will buy you some time definitely but I would have removed the thing and either wirewheeled it or better sandblasted it. Then painted it properly and coating it after that.
As a proud, Canadian, owner of an '07 XKR, I appreciate your content, Jack!  Looking forward to more!  Thank you!
40/50 years ago it was common for cars to allow water ingress, my old SD1 was always filling up! But I find it hard to believe that in this day and age most manufacturers still haven't eliminated the problem. Great video though Jack, very entertaining 👏🏻 and I'm so pleased that you saved yourself a small fortune.
Great channel Jack!  Painting over rust is never a good idea though. Moisture will get underneath the paint and be trapped, which accelerates decay. Just the Lanoguard would be a better idea if you want a quick fix 🤘
The quality of your videos never disappoint Jack, I've lost count the years I've been watching now.
This is what you do best Jack. I do like the reviews but this is your real strength. Very entertaining and informative content.
Great Job Jack!  I'm not sure if it's true with the 4.2 cars, but with the 5.0 cars you need to have the new battery programed to the car so that it will charge correctly.  Battery issues can cause endless headaches with these beauties, so just make sure that new battery will last.  Cheers
Well done Jack! I love seeing the economy minded approach to repairs!
Hello Jack. Great to see you getting your hands dirty again! For the subframe, or just rusty parts in general, a rust converter is a great step before wax oil treatment. In theory, encasing the part in wax oil should inhibit the rusting process, but if/when the wax oil chips away, you're back to square one. A UV clear coat on the headlights will keep them looking clear for longer.
I really enjoy this sort of video.  It's what got me hooked back in the Ferrari repair days.  The craziest estimate you quoted from Jag has the be the headlamp work.  So easy (and cheap) to just routinely buff out the headlamp housing.  Keep it coming!

So happy to see YouTube sponsoring this video! You definitely deserve it, so proud of how far you've come. Hope you take the time to appreciate what you've built now and then.
I bought one of the mini lightsabers when you were doing the million dollar fundraiser campaign, and it's absolutely amazing. I used it for a few hours on the 4th of July and had no issues. I didn't even have to refill it
Oh my Sweet Celestia I love the logo design with aperture science.

And I'd say it's accurate because you guys are the embodiment of ""Science is about WHY NOT?!""

Also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
Fun personal experience: for about a year, I worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with Class 10 clean rooms. No perfume, cologne, makeup, or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there. And no skin exposed. Everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed, and goggles that even had small air filters in them.

James I've gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode. This episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that I've been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today. I sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team. Def bought a mini-sabre too.😊
Not a starwars fan. More of a pirates of the caribbean guy. But I loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic. It's an amazing project, with an amazing team!
I know no one will see this, but I just want to say how amazing you guys are. From your Garage to the H.E.R.C facility I've watched every video. I've forgotten how long or at what amount of people I subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago. But I want to thank you guys for everything you're doing, pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers, chemists, physicists and rocket scientists. Keep up the amazing work, can't wait for the 'We Amputated this Guy's Limbs and turned him into Darth Vader' video. But seriously, you guys are awesome.
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists. been watching for a very long time (around 4 years). GOODLUCK HACKSMITH!
I am curious as to how they'll manage sabers clashing. It's been long theorized(and more or less confirmed in rebels) that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact. Maybe they'll be able to utilize something to that regard?
I love how casually he said ""let's play with liquid oxygen"" immediately after telling us how dangerous it is. Exactly what I'd expect from a sci-engineering/infotainment channel.
How far the hacksmith came is mind blowing
While watched you earlier you were just making Marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage
Now , the hacksmith is like an industry
Too happy for you my man
Keep going
Hacksmith is doing something, that even large companies wouldn't do. Big respect
The team at Hacksmith Industries actually do things that most people don’t even think of. It’s crazy 🤯.
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational. Maybe you're less stressed now or something, but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends.
I truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility. You can see engineering past, present and future in your labs.
You guys are awesome and are living the dream. So happy that you are allowing all us nerds this awesome experience, hope everything continues to go well!",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT16M51S

I love how serious Tate is, excited to see her career grow much further, I'm sure she has a very bright future ahead of her.
Omg Ms Tate should get into making ASMR as a side gig she would KILL it
okay but the jacket sounds are SOO relaxing?? she killed this 💫
i really appreciate that she took asmr seriously. it’s so annoying and rude when other celebrities don’t
You know the ASMR is elite when you’re not even wearing headphones and you get tingles ❤
AS SOMEONE WHO LOVES ASMR AND TATE THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVERRRR
I remember watching videos of her original songs when I was 9 or 10 and now I’m about to be 17. She’s made it so far and she deserves everything she has and more. She’s great at ASMR too
I haven’t listened to her in years but she’s grown so much! were almost 2 years apart, but I still feel like a proud mother💀 gonna stream her albums!
She's so good at it, and the candle lighting portion with the words of reassurance. The smirk and eye roll saying ""Relax"", I am now convinced shes watched some ASMR before.
This is such a good asmr video, she seems so natural at it. Got to say that 6 ads in under 20 mins was rough 😅
She needs to make her own asmr broo the crispiness of her whispers and binaural technique is so good
I am BEGGING for whoever edits these videos to make the part where they do ASMR with the W Magazine longer. it is so satisfying and one of my fav parts but always gets cut short
WOW this is cool she not only has a great singing voice she has a incredible whispering voice so soothing and soft fabulous T-McRae she impresses in every way..all the time so talented love it...

Lyrics
I told you I’d rise up
 
You’d be mistaken if you thought I was gone
Cause I’ve been waiting for this moment too long (Whoa)
Just to see the worry in your eyes
 
I bet you thought that I had fallen away
It never crossed your mind that there’d be a day (whoa)
I’d return to look you in the eyes
 
Don’t pray for me, You said there’s no hope in forgiving
Your happy to just leave me for the dead
Well time has passed I’m very much the living
And all that’s left is to leave you seeing red 
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.
 
I don’t believe that you have got any soul
You’re just a breed of your own kind all alone (Whoa)
An architect of your own decline
 
Nothing’s sacred anymore that’s the past
Its falling further even more out of grasp (Whoa)
You’re replaced and running out of time
 
No prayers from me, you see I’m not the one you think will
Just let it go and leave it all behind
You’re dead to me and I don’t even feel guilt
Just take a look cause it’s time for me to rise
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.
 
I don’t want to close my eyes
I can never get enough
Like the sun it’s time that I rise up
 
So when you think you’ve got me by a thread
You need think again
Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I’d rise up.

I love how you decided to close your career going back to your most true roots but keeping all the stuff you went through these years in it. It's like a twenty-five long nostalgia ride and it's fkin awesome.
I gonna miss a lot this band when they end promoting this last album, being a fan since kid and grow up listening to them... it's an invaluable thing for me.
Sum 41 forever 🤘🏻
I cannot believe you are going to retire when you can still release so many more bangers. I know you have your very valid personal reasons but damn, what the world is going to miss is incredible. Thank you for all these years, this last album is turning out absolutely spectacular, you will go with a bang. ❤
This is definitely a very ""sum 41 song"". Somehow they manage to make this music in-between metal-ish pop punk vibe. Can't wait to listen to the rest of the album
Omg this song is so good !! I don’t believe it. To put scream in a sum41 song might be a first no ? 😮 and the clip is so fun I m glad seeing the sums having fun together 🎉 cheers 🍻
Crazy song and video, probably one of the best in describing the essence of the sums and their flexibility with fast paced riffs, catchy chorus, melodic moment and epic solo by dave ❤❤
По кайфу!!!! Красаво!!! 🤘🤘🤘
These guys have been blowing my mind since I was 12 im 34 now I just woke up what an awesome  band/song to wake up to 😎😝
Sum 41 NEVER misses 🥺 thank you for all the amazing music you’ve put out thru out the years y’all really got me thru some rough shit and some not so rough shit too haha 😂 sum 41 really was all killer no filler after all 😂😂❤
AMAZING!! As usual!! I will be playing this on repeat until the album drops! I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE TOUR!! 🕶️🎸🖤🎶
They’re back!That’s what we want! What the hell!! Good vibes!! So amazing!! Thanks guyss!!  See u on  stage  soon!!🖤🔥
I have always wonder HOW you can combine so much styles in one song! Awesome! =)
Que som destruidor, agora sim, mandou muitoooooooooooo!!!!  <3 <3 <3 É assim que tem que ser Sum 41!!!!!! Gigante!!!! Eu senti um poder incrível ouvindo essa música!!!!! <3 <3 <3
Sum 41 just dropped this track and it hit me right in the feels and the gut – talk about a heart and gut combo! 🎶💥 Absolute vibes that resonate deep down. 🔥
DAMN. Yet another banger from these guys! I’m super excited for the full album! 🤘🏼
La banda está cerrando su carrera con broche de oro, tremenda canción, que geniales esos cambios de ritmo, la canción es perfecta, me llena bastante el corazón que estén sacando tan buenas canciones para su último álbum, Sum 41 fue mi primera banda favorita y la nostalgia se siente a full

love these videos sm grace!!! classic grackle. would love to see you trying vegan christmas options, as a throwback to your dairy free days <3
Your reactions to foods you don't like are the best 😂😂 Those facial expressions!
We had a party recently with loads of party food from different shops including the mini burgers from Sainsbury's, and yes they are super tiny but so yummy... safe to say they were gone instantly 😂 Waitrose has a nice fresh food party selection that you can preorder, they also do lush mini mince pies x
These videos never get old....And it wouldn't seem like Christmas without them. Thanks so much darling and Merry Christmas to you and your hubby. 😊🎅🎁🎄🎉🎶⛄🍭❄
These are like a tradition of mine - I watch them every year without fail (and often during the year when I miss those winter wonderland vibes) ❄️🤍
A pigs in blankets roll/bap/sandwich is my go to weekend breakfast during the festive season 😂 can’t go wrong
The Sainsbury's chocolate and salted caramel bar actually comes out of the plastic just fine whilst it's frozen, so don't loose hope on it everyone!
You’re literally helping me so much with your eating videos especially around Christmas time ❤
i am SO jealous of how clear your skin is omg. i can't even look at dairy, gluten or sugar without my skin erupting 😢 thoroughly enjoyed this vlog tho ily ❤
It would be super cool if you could make a similar video but with vegan Christmas food options. Need your opinions!
About the ""freshly baked in store"" it usually means that the product arrives frozen to the shop and they ""bake"" it (so it's not baked in store at all just heated/fully baked because it arrives par baked). We've been duped!
A mince pie review from all the different supermarkets could be cool? Maybe another great opportunity to feature Papa Booth? Xx
Every time I watch a grackle video I think “how can someone be so classy yet so messy at the same time?” She is gorgeous and we are blessed with her content 🙏🏻
Agree with you so much about fruit teas, the smell makes me expect a flavour EXPLOSIOONNNN and no matter how long i brew it, i just get a tickle of the flavour compared to the smell!
Loved this. Love these every year!! Can you do a Christmas recipes/ TikTok Christmas hacks video? And maybe a Christmas around the world video, talking about the traditions of different cultures? I loved your videos of the 50’s and other decades where thered be research and things. I’m loving vlogmas. Thank you for making Christmas 2023!! 💗🎄
I always find that fruit teas benefit from the addition of a neutral flavoured sweetener (white sugar rather than honey/maple) and it really enhances the taste.
Classics are good so please keep these up.  Your vibe is so fun and happy.  Keep being awesome.
I remember last year time you had that Santa butter and dear Mama Grack said to save it til Christmas Eve and now you can eat him early in your own home! 😆😍 xx

------------------------------------",6679,"I don't have enough words to say how great this segment was. The stare down between Seth and Punk made people go insane.
Perfect feud. No heel or face. Just two people with genuine hate and respect at the same time.
Half the crowd singing Seth’s theme and the other half chanting for Punk gives me chills. This feud will truly feed families. I can’t wait for this match.
That stare down and crowd reaction sent chills down my spine, we've waited 10 years for this
The tension, the split crowd, the history between them... This story is worthy of a Wrestlemania Main Event spot, which for both is long overdue!
This rivalry will be looked back on in 30 years as legendary and iconic
This segment right here, THIS, is what will ultimately pin Cody up vs Roman while Punk and Seth have this going on. This was powerful, and a precursor of things to come. The best WWE has been in years, and we have HHH to thank for it.
""That's your one pass to stand here and speak to me disrespectfully without me coming after you.""
- CM Punk
Having Seth and punk on the same show after everything that’s happened is just incredible! Both guys with genuine dislike for one another but also two guys who love wrestling! I truly believe once it’s all said and done both guys will bury the hatchet and become civil
I don't think I've ever heard a crowd trying to chant four different things at once from literally just a stare down, this is legendary
This was insane. Their rivalry is going to be legendary
Wrestling is back!! LOVED this!! The fine line between acting and reality. Drama. Hope WWE keeps on this path. Would be great if some of the others learn from these two…. This is what we’ve been missing!!!
This is definitely a feud of a generation. And it's actually dope how both punk and Rollins have used Punks aew drama (that wasnt his fault might I add) to make it as good as it is. Both when punk talked about him and Owens beating people up backstage and Seth borrowing from Hangman's promo
Meu Deus do céu essa encarada de Seth e CM PUNK foi na verdade uma briga velada!
Give these 2 their first main event spot at WrestleMania 🔥
The tension in this segment was insane. This is about to be a hell of a feud🔥🔥
This brought me back to those solid emotional staredown segments from back in the day
This was one of the best segments in a very long time. I like Serg when he's not over the top. This felt real. Punk has definitely made watching WWE live must see again.
The face of Punk when Seth's music started... priceless
Thanks HHH for making WWE great again
I'm at a loss for words. This was amazing! Vintage Punk and Vintage Rollins. I hope we eventually get to see this match!",17,Sports,98500000,PT17M54S

 #gaming #lego #fortnite",584,"EXTRA TIP: Carry 6 planks with you ALWAYS. You can 1. Craft a chest anywhere to repair all your tools (including the grappler which makes it actually useful) or 2. craft a bed once you get to the right town level, which as already stated is good for respawns (alternatively you can craft a bed with 10 wood early game and carry both with you)
Hiya Guys if my voice sounds a lil different it is because i have a really bad cold😅

*Regarding Tip 12 with the Grappler*
Thank you everyone for the comments i wasn't aware the chest tip worked with recharging the grappler so go ahead and craft one now 🤣
It may get patched soon though...

Really hope you all enjoyed this video and remember to use code ""RUGG"" in the item shop!
Thank you all so much for the support 😎
More LEGO Fortnite videos will be coming later this week
MAJOR TIPS, READ THIS!
Something to keep in mind, if you put the grappler in a chest when it has 1 use left and then break the chest, it resets the grappler back to 10 uses. It makes the grappler very work getting.

Another tip, if you take the barrels of TNT (found near old broken down buildings)  and throw them into clusters of trees, or cactuses then it is a quick way to farm the dessert snd frost biome logs
crazy how far people went with knowledge of this mode while i’m only at 3rd village lvl. great video as always!
For heavy wool have your villagers assigned to create textiles you will get it quite often
If you keep a hearty charm on, it can negate low temp or high temp damage. You remain at full HP, you get the temp hearts. So long as your at the first layer of hot/cold, the amount of damage and how fast it happens will be negated by the charm replacing the temp hearts.
i also found out an exploit to reset grappler charges back to 10. It usually happens after i die with it in my inventory and after i pick up my backpack it has 10 shots remaining even when it has been used. I also believe it resets after i quit the game and join back and all the charges return. Edit: just tried the durability reset on my purple tools and all of my items got stuck into the ground and i cant pick them up.
Suggestion: I explored my map a bit with nothing on me. Whenever I came across something interesting I would pick up small stones nearby, make a marker and place it there. That way I could mark important locations for later exploration and open up the maps view without losing anything. Then whenever I'm ready I'd gear up and already have points of interest marked on my map that I can immediately go to.
Great tip with the grappler, you don't have to break the chest, put it in and take it out, unfortunately not the same for tools
As of now, when it comes to dying of starvation, heat, or cold, there is a way to negate all of them with one item. It allowed me to stay in the desert caves infinitely even though I took fire damage the entire time. There is an uncommon charm that gives you two additional hearts if you're already full health, and it regenerates itself very quickly, meaning even if you take instances of damage from starvation, heat, or cold, it'll regenerate it self. This allowed me to much more quickly and effectively progress through the game, especially in regards to those desert caves.
MORE TIPS: 1. Instead of crafting chests to refresh your tools, just craft a “traditional counter” under “counters” as it only costs 8 wood. 

2. The grappler’s uses can be refreshed just like your tools, except it’s even easier. You don’t even need to break whatever chest/counter you’ve built. Just throw it in a storage thing, take it out, and it’s refreshed.
Thanks for the great tips.

My tip is for people starting a new server in Survival, set up a different server with the same seed in Sandbox mode so you can fly around and explore the map faster before setting up your town.
I actually would suggest making a grappler. It got me out of a really sticky situation in the fire cave and just like your weapon and tools you can reset the durability with the chest exploit👍 7:51
I don’t know if anyone said this yet but you don’t actually need cool headed charms for the desert, if you just use a hearty totem you can ignore the damage taken from the hot debuff since the totem will regenerate itself as long as you don’t lose your temporary hearts, and if you do lose them just eat something and wait a sec to let them regenerate back.
You can find sand shells at the beach/tropical coast areas. Access to the cool headed charm is easier due to the creature being found at both locations.
CRAFT THE GRAPPLER! it only sucks because it has 10 uses, but if you do the chest durability glitch it works on the grappler aswell, the grappler is op in the snow biome especially as there’s so many steep cliff faces and the grappler makes it so easy to traverse, make sure to carry 6 wood planks on you though as you will need to regularly reset it
#2 if ur early game run into the snow biome during daytime. its warmer then so u wont freeze to death as quickly.
also holding a torch in ur offhand will bypass the slow effect.
Heavy wool thread can also be obtained by your villagers (assign them to threading) if your on lvl 10 town hall theres a high chance they will give you heavy wool threads or normals
I would say it’s for sure worth making the grappler, just for sticky situations in caves and for traversing the land. You can do the durability glitch w/ the grappler in the chest so just throw it in there when You’re fixing your weapons and boom back to 10
Fun fact: You can reset the uses on the grappler if you put it into a chest and take it out. + aim at the highest point of a tree and it’ll work perfectly with the glider!",20,Gaming,287000,PT9M16S

Soy del Barca pero es Increible la forma en la que juega el Girona la verdad bien merecida victroria
¡Totalmente merecido! Fantástica victoria del Girona FC 💥
Their style of play, coupled with the passion and teamwork they displayed, truly made them deserving of the title this season. Well done, lads... 👏
Felicitar al Girona, no es fácil plantarte a las grandes y arrancarles puntos, jugaron con orden, sin complejos y con un concepto de equipo, de verdad, grande lo q está haciendo...
Always great to see small teams performing at this level. Again it makes La Liga attractive to football fans all over the world well done Girona and manegement they clearly have a vision
Como aficionado del Barça, el Girona merecía ganar y espero que sea campeón de LaLiga esta temporada.
DOVBYK AND TSYGANKOB ARE INSANE, TOP PLAYERS 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Soy madridista pero me alegra que un equipo como el Girona pudiera campeonar. Ojalá no pierda ritmo o se desinfle y quede campeón o si no, que califique a la champions
El primer gol es absolutamente increíble. Aleix García se quita 5 jugadores de en medio con un pase magistral.
La importancia de un pase al pie y una buena recepción. Con eso tienes medio gol!,estos chicos juegan muy bien

The last time Olivia Rodrigo performed a Tiny Desk concert, it was two years ago, in a deserted DMV office, back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldn't play the real Desk. But this year, the singer-songwriter returned, bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the NPR Music office. ""It's much cooler to be here,"" Rodrigo says. ""I was saying earlier, I've never been starstruck by a room before.""

Many of the songs on GUTS, which earned a special recommendation on NPR Music's Best Albums of 2023 list, blow out Rodrigo's sound into colorful, grungy pop-rock fit for a stadium, like ""love is embarrassing,"" performed here with Rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar. But the artist builds her set out with GUTS cuts that fit the intimate setup, like the searing ""vampire,"" her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines, or the potent ode to female jealousy, ""lacy,"" which Rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class. By the end of her set, she's completely alone at the piano for the sobering ""making the bed,"" and it's not difficult to see why she's one of pop's most promising rising performers.

Tiny Desk and SNL in the same weekend! She is CRUSHING IT
Her voice is so consistent with her album recordings that alone is so impressive.
can we just also appreciate the band and the supporting vocalists? they are amazing!
SET LIST
00:02 'love is embarrassing""
04:15 ""vampire""
09:22 ""lacy""
13:36 ""making the bed""
""Lacy"" and ""Making the Bed"" contain some of Olivia's most deeply introspective and creatively complexed lyrics on the GUTS album.  ""Lacy"" vividly defines the internal experience of envy and poetically describes the psychological and emotional tug-of-war raging inside of someone that both worships and despises another person who has become an obsession.  ""Making the Bed"" defines the internal struggle of accepting the inevitable side effects that come with getting everything that one wants while holding oneself responsible for the decisions that lead to negative results.  Olivia has said in interviews that she is proud of the songs on GUTS that explore other topics (outside of heartbreak), and both of these songs reveal the expanding imagery and specificity of her writing that is both real and relatable, especially when performed live.
I still have not recovered from the cathartic SNL performance and Olivia strikes again with four of my favorite songs from GUTS! Love the drama and the vocals in each of these songs.

the reason why I like this album so much is because I think it achieves what every artist hopes their follow-up album will.  she is a very mature songwriter, and you can hear her mature with her lyrics. sour was fun and represented her age very well, and I think guts does the same…but she has applied her deeper understanding of herself to her writing and has expressed some of her emotions more vulnerably, while still remaining integral to her personal style which initially popularized her. even lacy explores the concept of jealously on a much more intricate level than some of the songs on her previous album. this is a beautiful second album and such a fluid transition from sour. I’m excited to see what else she puts out in the future.
It’s just incredible how she has a beautiful voice even when she has no auto tune or edits, it’s amazing and an anomaly, truly.

Quick Edit: AHHH almost 100 LIKES?!
😮 this was far and away one of the BEST performances by Olivia EVER! Finally, she sang one of the BEST songs off GUTS, “Making the Bed” which she sang BEAUTIFULLY!! Also, “Lacy” was perfect too! Olivia is so gracious and polite; it’s so refreshing!
The energy and joy she puts into ""love is embarrassing"" really makes it stand out and come alive relative to the recorded version.  She's having fun and it shows.  All aree great of course
The personality. The talent. The kindness. We truly made the right artist famous. Thank you Olivia Rodrigo ❤
She is absolutely incredible; I love that she took a poetry class and it turned into a song! “Making the bed” blew me away!
Finally us love is embarrassing fans are getting to hear it performed. It’s so good!
Her tiny desk performances are always so good
I love Olivia's voice, interpretation, lyrics and band. All of them are just gorgeous at what they do. This was one of the best Tiny Desks I've ever seen, she totally deserves her grmmy nominations 💜💜💜
I felt like love is embarrassing was so underrated when it first came out and now she be opening her mini concerts with it im so happy 😭
This is such a fantastic performance only let down by the mic! It is so hard to sing live but she flawlessly sung it!!❤️❤️
The star power she has proves you dont have to be overly provocative to sell. Just pure talent",10,Music,8620000,PT18M16S

Mark being so suspicious and running from a man who’s just casually walking past him is oddly funny to me.
Mark giving a stranger the longest nickname gotta be my favourite part
mark doing an accidental jumpscare by doing the posters one at a time is hilarious to me
Imagine this from the NPC's perspective, it must be hilarious. You have another person who runs up, yells at the walls, screaming ""THIS IS DIFFERENT"" and then runs in the opposite direction
I like how 90 seconds into this game, Mark's already lost his mind, calling a totally harmless bystander ""Mr. Mustache, Receding Hairline, Phone in Left Hand, Briefcase In Right, No Socks, White Shirt, Black Pants Man.""
Markiplier perfectly, yet unintentionally summed up his content in one quote. ""I have a feeling now that I'm gonna be utterly confident, and then somethings going to go horrifically wrong."" 21:20.
Mark blindly following the rule of hugging the left wall to an annoying degree, but completely ignoring all the posters is such a weird dichotomy of rule following/breaking.
The briefcase guy: ""Oh, no. Not this guy again. Just keep walkig, John. Don't look at him, don't say a word. Just go ahead and forget about him""

Mark anytime he sees him: ""WELL, WELL. LOOK WHO IT IS!""
Mark doing the quick 180 after he sees the man smiling killed me😂😂😂
Mark: WHAT DID I DO WRONG?
The most obvious door knob in the center of the door: 👁👄👁
@12:10. So as we see, there was indeed an anomaly. That “graphical glitch” was indeed indicative of an anomaly he should have turned around for. 
The anomaly was that the posters on the wall were growing. The “graphical glitch” was the frame edge of the poster clipping through Mark’s vision.
we need the full uncut version of this. gotta see Mark being absolutely paranoid and practically unfiltered for an hour.
Imagine you’re just walking home from your horrible job and the same person just keeps staring at you and when you finally decide to stare back they cut you off and don’t let you continue walking 😂 12:48
Mark should do more of these kind of games, it’s funny how he gets frustrated.
i love games like this, nothing super flashy and there aren't really any in your face jump scares but the way its set up and the ambiance messes with your head and starts making you more and more paranoid, questioning EVERYTHING
This is actually such a neat concept and one of the better games I've seen Mark play
Him missing the one that literally tells him to turn back is actually really funny, idk why 😂
I like these types of let's plays because the audience can kind of play along
I usually dont enjoy these types of games but this one was so fun but this one had the looping element and the numbers to tell you if youre on the right track. That made it so much fun for me. Especially since mark kept dying at the WORST times. Getting to 8 so many times just to loop again is truly a nightmare. This must be what hell is like.",20,Gaming,36000000,PT36M39S

There is one thing all these youtubers should know:

""The only safe house in Minecraft is a hidden one!""
-Mumbo Jumbo
Oh boy… this sounds like a challenge to make truly the safest base that accounts for all of these… 🤔
Yeah these ‘safest bases’ are usually pathetically easy to enter. Their creators never critically analyze their defenses to determine whether they are actually necessary and often create ‘easy defenses’ that are redundant and pointless, serving to introduce more vulnerability
I thought this base was really secure but then I had a very good idea, I used F5, see using f5 gave me a whole new prospective and I was able to see that this base was insecure
I knew he would debunk it eventually, while watching I was like, bro kenadian is going to DESTROY This lol
Lesson learned: next time you want to build a base, watch out for kenadians in the wild.
Yer... The base is kinda dumb. It only works if you obey very specific rules, and it also only works fully during 1 particular type of weather that is quite rare.

All these safest bases just don't work without other mods, commands, datapacks etc to add additional mechanics.

Still thanks for showing just how easy it is.
When Kenadian is bored, he debunks random people with ridiculous ways
2 things:
1. I'm glad Carvs was a good sport about this, it's always nice to see someone who can take a joke.
2. I was thinking the exact same things when I was watching his video. I was like, ""Couldn't someone just fly or build through this whole thing? This design seems super exploitable.""
Someone dying in full netherite armour and food and tools: damn this is a safe base
Kenadian beating it without taking damage: *hold my beer*
2:31 3:22 I love the little detail of while he's explaining why this base is actually secure, he's just chilling in the middle of the ""danger"" zone with nothing but a few blocks and doors while in survival
This safest base was designed for half hearted new players in adventuremode.(New to minecraft)
that minecart upward movement tech is sick as hell
I looked at this base and thought it was very secure. But then I had a very good idea - I used blocks. See, using blocks gave me the ability to render all the security of the base useless while taking 0 damage without any armor/potions. Simple.
The fact they took the time to setup lightning spamming tridents but not the time to bring one elder guardian to the center of the base is hilarious to me
Guy went through like 15 scenarios to prove a point, mad respect
Is easier to destroy than to create. No base outside of a server with specific plugins or mods is safe from being destroyed or infiltrated. Still really good video showcasing all kinds of movement options to get inside of this base.
i was already impressed. but the half a heart challenge was the cherry on top for me. Well done

You lads should definitely make more of these. Thinking of other programmes like What Not To Wear, Changing Rooms, Dinner Date, Worlds Strictest Parents, Wife Swap and The Nanny.
The editing on this is unbelievably good hahaha
No one ever reacts to four in a bed, it's so good funny and even worse than come dine with me for arguments. Nothing sets off 40 year olds more than marking them a 3 because you found some dust on a lamp at their bnb! 😂 Big Brother should've been here too, that show is a mess 😂
i love this duo with all my heart ❤️
Say what you will about Lorraine and her crumble song, as soon as I saw her come up, the song came back into my head (before she started singing) and I hadn't seen her performance since it first aired years ago. She's a maverick and an exceptional songwriter
Honestly as someone with an eating disorder growing up watching all of these shows, supersize vs super skinny was incredibly enabling for me but the premise of the show would’ve actually helped me if someone had taken me (not kidnapping, professional help 😅)when I was younger before it got serious and put me in the same position as the people on that show without cameras and I saw what I would do to myself if I carried on and was able to see someone with the opposite problem’s perspective on myself and vice versa. I’m still working through things now with a dietitian but I haven’t relapsed fully in 2 years now and I’m healthier for it, I just wish I was caught earlier on by either my parents or teachers before it went really bad and I spent the majority of secondary in an office with a nurse at lunch once a week talking to a person from an eating disorder clinic over Skype and getting my BMI and bloods taken (thanks to my friends in school, I honestly don’t think I’d still be here without them).
I know you're not used to being told about things being a decent length, but finally we've  got a video of a good length 🤣 Good editing and a great duo.

Can we get a cover of Ablisa's singing on the useless tour? 😂

I'm sorry but the Crumble woman is great. That's British eccentricity at its finest. We need that fun, confidence, and friendly madness more than ever now. 

George saying ""why would you say that?"" on the Take Me Out bit - mate, do you remember your 100 v 1 video, by any chance? 😂 That guy did definitely say the wrong thing, but he can at least talk to females 😉😅

Embarrassing Bodies was great and horrific in equal parts 😂 Fat Families was simply amazing 🤣

The Jeremy Kyle Show was a mixed bag imo. Sometimes, it did seem to help people. Other times though, it did go too far. Plus, it was quite sad when blatant sexism etc was highlighted (like the guy who was laughed at by the audience for saying he had to jump out a window to escape his abusive girlfriend). Overall though, it definitely wasnt nearly as wild as the Jerry Springer show. That was crazy. They'd do stuff like bring on Dwarfs to fight, bonkers really 😅🤦🏻‍♂️
We definitely need a follow up to this! Naked Attraction and Take Me Out 😂
""Come on Ann, let's get you home."" HAHA !
Stephen + George's reactions make my day so much, when you've lost your job + will be spending most days alone, it's always nice to watch these videos with these 2 in - they make me so happy + cosy 🥹 !
I love Stephen so much, so naturally funny 😂
great vid, a part 2 vid could include the inbetweeners and Jeremey Kyle. plenty more iconic British tv shows
havent even finished watching yet but i know its gunna be so good keep up the great work lads!
These shows make me feel so much better about my train wreck of a life
As an aussie who watched a crazy amount of uk kids tv shows a 2000s/2010s kids tv show version of this would be epic
You missed Sun sea and suspicious parents that’s a proper British classic 😂

You deserve all the credit for having the ability to captivate a viewer for 40 minutes just by walking through the beautiful countryside and narrating it. True adventure. Good stuff as always Tom!
Not going to lie, the build up to xmas just isnt the same without a new GeoWizard adventure to follow.  Leep them coming mate, they're some of the best videos on YT!
These adventure videos for the past couple years have always made my day so much better. Your style of editing, music choice, and relaxing narration feels so cozy. Honestly tom, you’ve really inspired me with these adventures to get out there and do them myself. As a 17 year old living in the boring state of Illinois with no car, it’s a bit tougher for me to do things like this, but I surely will someday, hopefully sooner rather than later.
tom is the embodiment of a grandma saying 'why would you want to go to Australia when there are parts of Birmingham you haven't seen yet?'
Americans: Lemonade is clear and bubbly in the UK (similar to sprite but nicer). We call your Lemonade “Cloudy lemonade”
Your adventures, whether high-drama or low, continue to be the best content on Youtube. This was wonderful, so cozy and relaxing to watch. This may be the one channel I wish would post even longer videos, I could legit watch it for hours. Thank you, Tom!
I love the chill nature of this one, it's quite nice not to be listening out for screaming farmers chasing you down for once, and INCREDIBLY reassuring knowing you'll circumvent any bogs 😂 Honestly I'd gladly watch regular hiking/camping videos if you did them; Just you out exploring, discovering cool new places, with all the lemonade you could wish for in your backpack.
Mad props to Tom for being able to keep so many of us glued to our screens by simply just walking in the English countryside. Can’t wait for part two.
Massive shout out to the Shrewsbury Arms. I hope at least some of the people watching this video will seek out that pub and bring their custom as a thank you for that lady’s kindness.
Best youtuber on the planet. No money involved just pure adventure and exploration in the endless fields of the UK. Serious talent making these videos so compelling to watch and also inspiring for other adventurers alike.
I love how popular Tom's videos are because he doesn't put on a fake persona or overdo it. It's just pure adventure, exploration and joyful content and I really appreciate it! Keep being an awesome guy Tom.
I always get excited for these adventure videos! You have inspired me to wander around the peak district where i live, making up my own challenges ever since the OG Wales line. Can't wait for episode 2, it looks like you passed through Butterton in the intro, but could be wrong. Here's a tenner to fund the next one, keep exploring my dude.
This man delivers some of the best videos on YouTube. The sense of adventure is so real. Someone needs to get him a TV show
I love that the emphasis in the preamble is on a more leisurely approach and sticking to paths…and yet by about 5 minutes in Tom is clawing his way through hedgerows and getting stung by nettles 😂
I’ve been watching you for a while, I didn’t know we lived so close. You walked straight past our family farm and through a few of our neighbours farms/fields. 
Our fields maybe be private land but aslong as you are respectful and leave nothing but footprints and take nothing but photos your more than welcome friend. Was such a pleasure to see our area on YouTube.
The camera angle, the music, the soothing poetry and choice of words. These videos transport me back to the straight line videos and evoke such an unexplainable emotion from me. Happy times, thanks Tom
The  description of how you would wander and imagine adventure around the forests, rivers and towns hit very, VERY close to home. Such a fantastic childhood that was. I miss it and truly look forward to this video. Cheers.",19,Travel & Events,1240000,PT40M3S

I love how when you shoot a zombie it reacts a moment after you hit it. This realism is truly ahead of it's time.
The fact that you managed to encounter some zombies puts you ahead of a bunch of other reviewers I've seen.
That ""division, subtraction"" joke was fucking brilliant.
“Your speech organs seem fine.”

Real actual dialogue.
""Your speech organs seem fine"" being one of the first things you hear in this game is truly something else man
Calling this game ""Subtraction"" as a reference to Division is actually a stroke of genius

No, they went with ""try getting off the bed"", a very realistic line that a real person would definitely say
This game makes me appreciate actual video game artists 1000x more
It cracks me up that the description for the roamer class at the beginning says, “with the onset of the apocalypse, you set a goal to change your life for the better.” Like how and why does the apocalypse inspire someone to start improving their life if they were a drunkard before? 😂
Dunkey's wisecracks in this were some of his best for sure. You can tell the power of dad jokes are beginning to course through his veins.
it's extremely funny to me that a day after posting this video, the studio behind this game announces they're closing
Walking around an empty city truly makes this a ""Strand-type game""
When Gollum was released, Daedalic ended up closing their studios over a month later. 
This game releases and Fntastic Studios closes up 4 days later, the game has also since been removed from the Steam Marketplace.

#RedFalcon #Gaming #Mario",475,"Wubba's fate is still tragic, but congrats to the winner!! What a well-deserved victory
That was a masterpiece, a total roller-coaster of emotions. Even the man with no tear ducts that can't cry shed tears for our fallen warriors. We love you Hoppy. And R.I.P Metal Mario the original under dog
this one is special to us. i hope you all enjoy and thank you for making this possible ❤
if goomba made it past the first level he def woulda beat the game
Genuinely did not expect metal to go much farther than goomba due to the lack of hops. That was a wild vid
Even though hoppy cat won, congrats to medal Mario for being the underdog
This video is the true definition of tragic. I rooted for metal mario the whole way through, but he came just short. But congratulations hoppycat for the well deserved victory.
Why do you feel more attached to a video if you were in its stream, can’t wait for the faster Mario kart to become a vid :)
But… how far can the hoppycat go?
with all metal mario went through to make it as far as he did, he DESERVED first, he was screwed over from the start and had to work for every single victory, meanwhile hoppycat was just blessed with perfection. Even if metal mario only got second, he had to work for it. im curious to see how far metal mario could go if it weren't for that level, and would enjoy watching that much more then a hoppy cat only playthrough given the only thing that could stop hoppycat is breakable blocks below or to the side he needs to get past
Mods are already so crazy.... I'm so excited to see custom worlds and maybe custom wonder seeds!!
The fact that metal made it that far when we thought it wasn’t possible is impressive itself
This is crazy! I haven’t seen the end yet, but this is gonna be interesting, every wonder form provides different mechanics and interesting gameplay, so the different mechanics are gonna make every level super interesting.
As a massive hoppycat fan i see this video as an absolute win!
You should absolutely make a video seeing how far hoppycat can go, and I already know he’ll be going to world 4 at least, since he is from world 3 and is the power up in some of those levels. I was rooting for them and am so happy they won.
I'd love to see Hoppycat beat the game! Always love the little enemies.
Great video, so many twists and turns! As a long time red falcon fan I must say I'm loving these new videos and editing style!
wonder how far the wubba would've made it if water levels weren't required, i feel like with its versatility it could beat any other level in the game
Fantastic video! Love the concept, execution, and editing!

It belongs to a pliosaur, a ferocious marine reptile that terrorised the oceans about 150 million years ago.

The 2m-long fossil is one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered and is giving new insights into this ancient predator.

The skull will be featured in a special David Attenborough programme on BBC One on New Year's Day.

#Palaeontology #SeaCreatures #BBCNews",3906,"Wonderful to see Sir David Attenborough still active!  Bless you!
Thats looks like what a ""Dragon""skull would look like. Thats awesome
Beside the big fossil, let's not forget to admire the smaller one, the amazing 97 year old Sir David, still standing tall, rocking the boat telling us about it😮!.
Early sailors may have found things like this and imagined sea monsters were still alive in the oceans. Thiis is amazing !!
My God, I'm a fisherman in California and I've just realized that I sold a huge squid beak to Steve Etches several years ago!  He contacted me one day through my online ad saying he wanted one for his museum.  I had totally forgotten his name until I saw this report.  So honored to have one of my specimens on display in his collection to be viewed by (hopefully) many generations to come.
Paleontologists dream find, I don't think this short story can adequately cover the magnitude of how incredible this discovery was and how serious Steve Etches is when he says he could spend the rest of his life with this fossil
The amount of human and natural history in the UK is mind blowing ❤️🇬🇧
Wow, really amazing how well the skull is preserved! The teeth look amazing, I hope they find the whole fossilized pliosaur.
The Jurassic Coast is known for its rich fossil record, and this discovery is certainly significant
Yes, that is an amazing piece of history and a magnificent animal indeed. But guys? Sir David Attenborough is 97 years old! And he's on a swaying boat that makes most YOUNG people seasick. It is Sir David Attenborough that is the true beast of nature here folks. Seriously.
Fantastic! As a child I was fascinated with dinosaurs and their cousins. This still brings me joy !
Glad to see Sir David Attenborough healthy and still contributing to the world of documentaries.. I was some how emotional seeing him in this video🙏
If this was how terrifying life looked like millions of years ago on earth, Imagine whats out there in the universe in different shapes and forms. Absolutely fascinating
And this dwarfs the entire human existence!  Huge respect to these species to be able to go beyond millions of years!
Amazingly well preserved for a skull that big. Most of the time they are crushed to pieces and some of the pieces are just gone
I am in awe of this find. Having spent a few hours wandering along beaches on the Jurassic Coast I can imagine how excited the man who discovered this must have been. 
Fantastic find and a beautiful specimen.
Was great to be a part of this project! Hosting Sir David Attenborough on our boat, Snapper Charters was a real career highlight!
This reminds me a bit of that incredible Ankylosaur fossil that was basically perfectly preserved (pretty much the whole body, not just the head). 

And to think that fossilization in and of itself is already a very rare thing to start with, and then to have a fossil like this, is indeed incredible. I can't recall the statistic on this but fossilization is a process that occurs only something like 5% of the time any living animal dies, maybe less. Even if we were to unearth ALL the fossils from the crust of our planet today, it would only represent a very small fraction of all the possible animal species - that quite possibly - we'll never know about because it's possible that not a single specimen went through a 'successful' fossilization process.
I love this stuff!  I contemplated Paleontology for a bit, but instead went for my masters in Biological Anthropology.  I always geek out about these findings!!

Jacob is a PHENOMENAL actor
Lou, Vic, and Jake, on one episode of game changer. That's 100% going to be a banger
I love getting all worked up for a new Dropout trailer and then sadly realizing that there is no one in my office who could possibly share my excitement
The way my heart caught in my throat when Jacob started yelling at Sam.
Love that BDG is doing a lot of stuff with Dropout nowadays.
I can’t tell you how excited I am to see Nathan on Dropout again. Please please please more collabs with the Drawfee hosts. Their gremlin energy is just what I need ❤
Seeing Nathan actually makes me a little emotional. Drawfee needed some time to be its own thing after it split off from dropout/CH, but I'm glad to see some Drawfee/dropout mixing is still possible.
I saw Jacob storm out and then the TV says “do something great for the trailer” I mean…. I had to pause the trailer because I started dying of laughter
Well Jacob better have gotten points because my heartrate spiked at that moment 😂
The fact that I was not scared at all Jake was genuinely upset really speaks to the integrity of Dropout
More Vic, more Brennan meltdowns, and more Grant skin? YES, PLEASE. Also, I love how ""upset a producer"" was as simple as unscrewing some lightbulbs on the set, but now we have the entire set covered in graffiti dicks 😂Give the producers a raise for dealing with that chaos! 😁
BDG, Sungwon, AND NATHAN?! The already incredible cast is only getter better 🥺
I'm so excited
I'm stoked as always. And I just wanted to say that the ""that should cut good"" shows such respect for your audience, and we hardly ever see that in reality TV. Nicely done, y'all.
BDG and Sungwon graduating from Make Some Noise to Game Changer proper plus Caldwell and Nathan making their Game Changer debuts?!?! Oh yeah. This is gonna be a good season.
Love how the marketing/throughline of this series keeps getting slightly more ""horror/thriller"" with each season.
Jesus, Jacob’s acting legitimately got me there for a second
I'm so relieved Jacob wasn't actually upset! I teared up a bit lol
I’m so excited for Nathan Drawfee!! Hopefully this will lead to more Drawfee/Dropout crossovers in the future, I need some more snilk and Drawtectives deserves to be seen by the ttrpg masses
I’m so excited to see Nathan. As a huge drawfee fan and dropout fan I’m happy to see you folks doing stuff together. Even after Drawfee went independent I hoped there’d be some crossovers still. And I’m not disappointed. (I see why you didn’t have Karina, she’s too powerful. Although she’d rock in a yu-gi-oh episode of um actually.) 

Also wow, Jake’s acting! Phenomenal.

What a game from Son! Stick him up front and he plays like the second best striker in the league and out wide he’s still the same old Sonny. People said he can’t play wide anymore as he’s lost it, but what a performance - never seen Trips get turned inside out like that!!
Son has stepped up to the plate incredibly well since Kane left. He’s truly their talisman now.. what a player.
Son was unbelievable wreaking havoc down that left flank
Pape Sarr was Unbelievable today, his presence in midfield definitely affected the way we played.
He was intercepting everywhere  and constantly trying to start attacks!
My man of the Match along with Son
The way Sonny delivered those first two goals for his team - simply world-class! A pseudo hat trick for Sonny in my books.
Fair play to spurs, they were on fire today. Also, Ange is always a class act no matter the result.
Son's loyalty to Spurs is almost unimaginable
As a Newcastle fan, we were awful...but good on Spurs. They easily deserved the full points. Zero complaints.
This is probably the most unpredictable premier league season I can remember for a long time.
Unbelievable defending from davies at the beginning. Could’ve completely changed the game if he didn’t do that
It’s been so painful as a spurs fan seeing all these 2-1 losses win meant a lot today coys
Tottenham are so lucky to have a player like Son. Genuinely he’s an all-time premier league in my eyes ❤️
As a newcastle fan you can only respect son he had us on toast for the full 90
I think Son is everyones favourite player outside of their own club... just a great player and a likeable dude.
Toon fan. Spurs were awesome today! Really great attacking play and pressing like we do...when we arent knackered! Hope Spurs do well from here. Hopefully we get some players back soon.
""Porro, it's a decent ball"" if the likes of de bruyne played that ball it would be described as world class. Porros passing is incredible
Spurs had Sarr back and that made a difference. His energy and drive  helps the tempo of the game. Ange using Son on the left was masterful. Son knows to drive and get the cross in. not bass in backwords, Kulu in the middle work as he couldn't slow the game down by cutting in.  Johnson had a better game too.  Perro was outstanding. Spurs have NF and Everton next. Two games they should get a win. When they get there full team back can really see Spurs going on a long unbeaten run.
Richarlison really delivering was unexpected - good for him - its about time!
Can we just appreciate that touch from Davies? Knew exactly what he was doing! Let the ball roll over his foot rather than try to clear it and end up putting it in his own net. Isaac hadn’t anticipated the touch, brilliant defending!!!",17,Sports,4680000,PT3M11S

Sean Dyche is doing a brilliant job at Everton
Congrats to Chelsea for beating Newcastle 2-0 despite this 👏
As a football fan, I love to see the underdogs winning a game, unfortunately i didn’t get to see that today
Sean Dyche deserves so much respect for the job he’s doing at Everton
To think Everton would be in the top half if it weren’t for the deduction 😳
Doucure needs his flowers. He consistently leaves his blood sweat and tears on the pitch in every game. The passion, you’d think he came up from their academy. It’s soo rare for me to see the grit he shows
As a Chelsea fan, we are a shambles! But well done Everton! You deserve the  credit for getting out the bottom 3!
proud of lewis dobbin, was here at derby on loan last season and what a player he is! his talent is coming to fruition.
I’m a Liverpool fan but Cmon Everton well done lads that was top class work especially after the ridiculous 10 point deduction your absolutely smashing back in there faces, fair play 👍
I love my club.  They may have put us through the mill over the past couple of years but we somehow managed to just keep our heads above water and dodge relegation.

Go into this season looking like a completely different and rejuvenated team only to then get stung with a 10 point deduction.

The way the team has responded since that (barring the Man Utd result) has been nothing short of outstanding.

8 days, 3 games played, 3 games won, 6 goals scored, no goals conceded.

UTFT!!! 💙💙💙
i’m a liverpool fan and i can’t explain how much i hate the premier league for the 10 point deduction it’s ridiculous it’s actually nice to see everton playing well. No real football fan wants to see them go down
Got to say hats off to Dyche, the lads & the supporters of Everton football club after the shady 10 point deduction in the middle of a season. Yous have a responded brilliantly. Everton fans deserve this from a mackem next best thing to a SAFC win is an Everton win.
Not an Everton supporter but loving the fight this team has given recent point deduction. 😊
it is sooo good to see Everton back to winning against small teams like chelsea after that 10 point deduction.
LFC fan since 1995 here
Well done lads! Well done.
You showed Real class and true passion of the game!
Massive respect for Everton and Dyche. From a Liverpool supporter
If Everton hadn't been deducted those points they would be mid table by now. They've been magnificent and hats off to them and their fans. I hope they have a great season.
Happy for both Everton Fanbase and Sean Dyche after the 10 point reduction. Didn't let their heads down and doing the business 🎉

Honestly Bethesda owes modders millions for fixing their games all these years.
quick update- had to briefly mute a section around 30min mark because it got copyright claimed for using the House Building song from RDR2. All I basically say is that “the bounty system in starfield is even worse than RDR2 and being a pirate is so discouraged it’s borderline impossible” anyways thanks so much for watching this video 🥹 I was so nervous about trying the new format and pushing myself creatively so it means the world to see people resonate with it! ❤❤ big ups to the whole island

An amazing and high quality video as always Jakey! I seriously appreciate you mentioning how good Skyrim's OST is since that's like the king of music for me. FYI the audio cuts out at 29:48 - 30:05 and 30:15 - 30:23
Really impressive how the audio throughout this whole video stays on such a consistent level despite all the different locations
love the new editing, the flow, the script, the scene choices, the cutaway timing, all while the presentation and the delivery remains the same. New, but nostalgic. This is a huge development in the NakeyJakey career path, maybe getting a bit wiser...  can't wait to see a new video in like 3 years!
16:55 as a parent of a toddler seeing this Ms. Rachel spoof sent me. It was really well done. And to be clear, we absolutely adore Ms. Rachel in my house.
For a year before Starfield’s launch, my manager couldn’t stop talking about it. He would go on and on about how it was everything he’s ever wanted and he was no longer going to leave his house when it launched.

Last week, he came poked his head out from the other room and asked, “What was the name of that space game we used to play?” Dude couldn’t even remember the name of it anymore. Now granted, my manager is also kind of reeeeally stupid (his favorite movie of all time is Battlefield Earth…. I know), but I still feel like this means something.
That clip of Todd Howard saying how he told everyone he’d make video games when he grew up was heartbreaking seeing how some games turned out because the passion is clearly there
Dear Jacob,

Another fantastic video as always. I really liked the style of cinematography in this one. It was obviously different than your usual style, but that's not a bad thing by any means. It felt like a grounded conversation with a close friend. 

I've been following your content since 2017 - went all the way through high school and am starting college now, always looking forward to the next Jarby video. Thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us, and enjoy the holidays!
An entire town wanting you dead in Skyrim for stealing a mug or killing a chicken was already a bit silly, but the idea that Starfield escalated that to an entire galaxy knowing what you've done is the funniest thing I've heard all week.
I think the signs were there a long time ago...I played ES4 Oblivion extensively...wasn't perfect but I still had a lot of fun with it...when Skyrim came out I was hyped, but I never bothered to finish the initial campaign until a few years after I got it, it was exceptionally underwhelming. I still say that if your side quests are more interesting than your main quest line (EG, I always preferred Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storyline over fighting dragons,) then something has gone terribly wrong.
Something that personally killed the vibe in starfield was that every ""unexplored frontier"" planet had like dozens of mining operations and settlements on it. I'm not exploring and finding something new, I'm just playing tourist. It would have been awesome to play a story where you got to explore and meet other undiscovered alien empires instead of finding fuel depot #35
Thank you for finally putting into words why I just could not get into Starfield! I am a huge Bethesda fan - I have been playing Skyrim since 2011 and still fire it up sometimes, along with the Fallout games. I wanted to love Starfield so much, but after a few hours I just had to give it up because the sense of exploration and atmosphere just was not there. I also think you're one of the few people who shares my opinion on Fallout 3's atmosphere vs. New Vegas, so I appreciate the nod to that as well.
Starfield feels like one of those boardgames you abandon on turn 1 after an hour of trying to learn the rules with your friends and everyone just kinda realizes this isn't fun and there's like 20 other games on the shelf we could have set up in the time it takes to finish the next turn.
33:33 Funny thing about the item vacuum in jail. The items they take from you are usually stored in the nearest chest in the same room, and the lock pick difficulty on them is usually expert or lower. Early game it’s actually more viable to just go to jail to get your name cleared, lock pick your stuff back, then be on your way.
I hope you have as much fun making these videos as I do watching them. Whether it's 6 videos a year or just 1, I am here for it. Thanks! ❤",23,Comedy,1960000,PT37M22S

The fact that they put there time just to make us entertained I love y’all!

man, seeing these talented individuals make such wonderful art out of the craziest things makes me wish I could do the same thing XD

david's piece was just SO beautiful for being made out of melted chocolate, like DAYUM. I honestly loved mackenzie's piece as well, it was just SO detailed and amazing looking and I feel like if she wasn't punished so much she would've definitely had enough time to make a full body to attach to the head to make it look even more epic than it already did and it seriously would've been a hard decision and a SUPER close win. I honestly really loved michelle's piece, it was just SUPER adorable and honestly deserved top 3 <3
David's painting is amazing , love his style ❤ Michelle's squid and Mackenzie's dino skeleton was really good and realistic

As a Quins fan, that is the best I've seen Marcus play for a long time- and it was against Racing away! Didn't put a foot wrong all night.
Unreal game from Marcus Smith - Care, Esterheizen and Dino Lamb all deserve honourable mentions
Do not underestimate the magnitude of this win - an English club going to France, let alone Racing one of the strongest French clubs, and winning is huge 

Well done Quins 👏
massive win for quins
COME ON YOU QUINS
Saracens fan here - what a game by Quins, playing well about their station. Bring that to Tottenham next March, and we have a serious game on. Well done
Great win. Marcus Smith was excellent. From a Stormers fan.
What a match!
Dino Lamb deserves a lot of credit - never rated him until this season he’s rly turned it around
that was an incredible tackle in the last play, very gutsy and determined. Great game.
As a Lions (Gauteng variety) fan, well done Quinns. Marcus had an outstanding game!! Hope we get to this level of performance in the 6 nations.
Massive win for Quins - Dino Lamb and Will Joseph rly stepped up well done
Dino Lamb, once again, had a fantastic performance
Damn. Nice one Quins.
Fantastic win for Quins , regardless of the result i thought they were the better team on the day, they played some great stuff at times.
What a brilliantly mad game. Great win Quins.
Superb win for Quinn’s!
Seen other teams in this situation take a tap instead of a scrum (with opponent in bin) and likewise screw up. Poor management.

1. The “plank of wood” under the car isn’t actually wood, it’s a plank of resin with titanium blocks (skid blocks) in certain parts of the plank. This is where the sparks come from when they skid across the ground.

2. “KERS” is a bit dated — it’s just ERS now lol, that’s because while there is kinetic energy recovery from braking; MGU-K (motor generator unit - kinetic), there is also energy recovery from the exhaust gasses; MGU-H (motor generator unit - heat).

3. DRS was brought in for 2011 because with the newer cars in 2010 it was basically too difficult to overtake so this was an aid. When the driver behind is within 1 second, they gain access to DRS to try and make the pass, the regulations state that the current DRS gap can be maximum of 85mm, so any larger than this = disqualification.

Awesome video Marques! Thanks for bringing our awesome sport to so many more people 😁
DRS was never a feature only used by one team which then spread to others. From the start (2011) it was mandated by the FIA in order to counter the negative effects of dirty air (when following another car) and as such promote more overtaking and therefore more exciting races. It could never have been developed by an individual team anyway because it would've represented a movable part which affected aerodynamics - something that has been banned in F1 since the 1960s.
4:07. Also a quick note to new F1 fans: The halo was designed by Mercedes for the FIA and was built using titanium encased within carbon fibre, not iron.
It can withstand the weight of a double-decker bus (or the equivalent of around 12000kg).
Now u gotta get a sim rig going! Got into F1 a few years ago now and been loving it. Awesome video!
Great video Marques! The actual race itself was SO fun!
Hello Marques. I come from Germany and have been watching Formula 1 for over 40 years and still love it today. I give you a big applause👏 for this video. Very good, short but also detailed explanation of the topic. I think that the future Formula 1 series with Andretti will have a big impact on the popularity of the sport in the USA. Thanks for doing this great YouTube job!!! Love to see your videos 👍
Glad that you are into f1. Something not many people talk about is the skills, talents and fitness level of these drivers and how they progressed through different categories before getting into the pinnacle of motorsports. Their offseason training is also incredibly cool.
Been watching f1 since 2012, I am glad you started following f1 as well, as Tech enthusias I am sure you will love it. I think your describe it as ""Science fair"" is the perfect description. I always love to see how the car evolve from the start to the end of the season, and you can notice how some team take design inspiration form other by looking and compare their car from different stage of the season.
I was fortunate to go to a race 2 years ago. I was at the end of turn 1 right after one of the fastest straights of the season. It was like watching a fleet of star wars ships jumping out of hyperspace. Incredibly fast and then decelerating abruptly. It was awesome.
12:35 it didn't just suck the manhole cover out of the ground, it broke the (cracked) welds holding it in place 😮
It is great to see so many more people enjoying F1 now. I speak from only being a fan for about a year so far, and even in that time the audience is only getting bigger. Great video giving a breakdown of how the sport works Marques!
Great video highlighting the geniuses behind F1!

One other thing, the 2020 season was delayed by 4 months due to Covid but the teams utilised their engineers to help with pandemic by designing and manufacturing respiratory equipment.
Best F1 ever were the V10 motors. I will never forget the first time I walked into Catalunya Circuit in Spain 2005, the sound, fire and energy you could literally feel coming out of those V10 engines and exhaust's, to this day still gives me chills when I think about it.
Great video...I'm happy you made it. Hopefully it will encourage a few people to check out a race. I got into F1 a few years ago and look for every opportunity to introduce it to people. It's awesome to see it becoming more of a thing here in the States.
As a F1 fan, this is a great video I should say....very simplified and generalized ❤
I have been blessed to be able to attend 2 race weekends in Austin for the USGP. It’s exactly as he said nothing compares to seeing it live and in person. I sat on turn 15 so just after the straight away and through turns 12,13, and 14. The amount of battles I saw coming through turns just to see these cars open up and hit near top speed going into the long right hander of turn 16 was truly amazing. It’s an experience I tell everyone they need to have at least once in their life.
I give you a very high salute for explaining this to those who are new to F1 and never knew the facts you explained so perfectly. You now see that it is the highest technical form of auto racing. I who have been a F1 fan since my childhood seen grow a very long way. Great job and I'm so glad to see you gain interest in F1. I have always enjoyed your content from when you started.
I'm glad you're on board the F1 train!
Been watching F1 for at least 2 decades now, and it's fascinating, data driven sports. Glad you've embraced it!

Liberty Media's been successful in engaging more fans in the US, that's great to see.
What's not so great for those in the US is the timing of the sports, given it's mostly catered to the European audience, but hey, glad you've embraced F1!
Congrats Marques; I've been following the sport from the late '90s and love it...I'm happy that you have now discovered this amazing spectacle, and at one of the BEST races at very least year in Los Vegas; it was incredibly dynamic and exciting, so I'm very happy for you as a new fan that you got your introduction at that race, which I'm sure will go down as a 'classic' in F1 history!!  😃
Could also mention how teams will experiment with all kinds of different parts during practice and will swap out several new ideas (not all of which work) and use ""FlowVis"", which is a neon green liquid they spray on the car to see how the aerodynamics interact with the the air.  Otherwise really great intro to F1 👍 I completely agree it is the world most competive tech science fair, and it's awesome to see MKBHD become an F1 fan like us! 😄🏎🏁🙌",28,Science & Technology,18000000,PT19M30S

Can we just appreciate how good this season has been and we're not even at Christmas.
Nice to see Raúl Jiménez performing consistently again after that horrific injury, the guy was a monster during that 19-20 Wolves season.
Fulham brought back a -10 goal difference to 0 in just two games, phenomenal stuff..
The turn by Wilson on the missed chance was sublime
Credit to Fulham they turned us over today an absolute masterclass from them fully deserved the 3points all 5 goals really well worked team display. As a West Ham fan not happy with the result but always a hard place to go to. Good luck to Fulham for the remainder of the season
Fulham fan here. I have absolutely no idea what’s going on but I’m loving it. Loving the Raùl Jimenez redemption the most. I don’t want this to end!
Fulham Transformation is Insane. Villa and Fulham has definitely been a shock for me
16 goals in the last 4 games for Fulham! 😲
Raul Jimenez is back to form, you love to see it
Loved that from Wilson. 4 goals up and a chance for a brace but did the right thing💪🏾
What a win for Fulham!
As a West Ham fan, i had some terrible thoughts after this game, but I do have to give credit to Fulham, scoring 10 in their last 2 and also conceding 0. Fair play, I guess.
Unselfish play when you're 4-0 up is always a mark of a true professional.
It's insane that they scored 10 in goals in 2 matches without conceding a goal. They really are improving a lot better
Marco Silva, he’s a genius.

Since the international break we’ve scored 16 in 4. The entire rest of the season we’d scored 10 in 12!
Willian has gone from looking finished in the Brazilian league to being one of the PL's most consistent wingers. Wow.
how's nobody talking about harry Wilson he's been so good this season
Wilson such a team player and what a talent!
Great to see Jimenez scoring again. Before his injury a lot of clubs wanted him 19 20 season he was unstoppable! Fair play to Fulham also 10 goals scored in 2 game 0 conceded",17,Sports,4680000,PT2M56S

Too clean to use, even down the road. Needs to be in a museum or bought by Ford. Amazing thought has gone into this build.
Give him £9,000! It's just an extra £500 and he deserves it!
What an amazing car. It's absolute madness that it didn't sell for 10k. I'd say it's worth 12k+ to a true Fast Ford enthusiast.

Great to see it on the channel 👍
As a life long Ford fan, this should be a 20k car. Unfortunately it isn't at the present time, but definitely will be if kept the same in the future. An outstanding car, the owner should be beyond proud. 👌
This is incredible full respect for making this what it is. totally agree with the seats, leather is the most over rated material when buying my golf I wanted the cloth 👍👍
8.5k , what a great price. How he has not sold it for a higher price I don’t know but as someone said it’s niche product. George would be a fantastic ambassador and reviewer for your channel. You’ve met some nice people along the way but he’s the best. Get him on board. I know they say don’t mix your hobby with your job but he’s way to passionate and knowledgeable about cars to not be working in the industry.
Think it’s a shame this going on Planet of Dreams. This car is stunning and needs to go to a collector as not many left like that. Hope it goes to someone who  looks after it, rather than rags it to death. Great video, George seems a top fella and love the content Calv👍
What an amazing job. That looks bloody fantastic. Absolutely perfect for a little cruise on a dry summer day.
Not sure that putting it on POD is the right move though. The chances of it being won by someone who will cherish it are bloody slim compared to the likelihood it will be won by someone who just thought they would have a go because its free. Such a shame
It might be an old Focus ST, but it’s an absolute credit to the previous owner and there truly isn’t many people who are this dedicated to the cause!
That’s one amazing ST, love it. George has done a fantastic job on it, what a guy 👊🏻 that sure is a car to cherish.
In my time watching, I have never seen Cal this sort of ""speechless"". What an immaculate car, major credit to him!
I love nothing more then getting a car back to it's best, this guys is on another level. Well done sir!
Fair play to him building this car. It's not about what it's worth, it's about the passion and love for cars. I too have spent far too much on my own car and get told I'm crazy. 

And fair play to you Calv. I don't know of another automotive youtuber that gives back as much to his followers as you. Proper diamond bloke 💎
Incredible just incredible Calv 😲 what a true gem of a car! I just pray that whoever is lucky enough to win this Beauty will appreciate all the work thats been done on it and also what your sacrificing to just go and give it away instead of having it as a show piece at Binca  where it would be safe and live on for years to come !
Wow whar a car!!!...A proper labour of love...George what a genuinely humble nice guy who with his passion for his car spared no cash for doing everything on the car!!!...Whoever wins this is getting one hell of a car!!!...Love the video Calv bro...👏🏻💪🏻😍🚘
I think it's an experience thing.
Like I'm 8k+ deep into mods/upgrades on my 3 MPS and although I wouldn't change a thing because I've enjoyed learning about all the things along the way and the experience of working on it to that degree, if I decided to get another one later down the line, I'd definitely spend a bit extra initially for one that's already had the work done. 😅

It's the enthusiast life I suppose, so many others can relate.

That ST is a legit gem though.

This is unbelievable! Fionn dares sing this song one day after Shane McGowan's funeral and honours this great singer. But the way Fionn does this is simply out of this world, and fortunately the people around him join in and are grateful. Fionn, you are a champion, even at this young age! Wish you well! Thank you DCT, thank you Sean!

Eddie i love your positivity you helped me a lot to motivate myself to go into the gym! I lost about 100kg 2 years ago and still holding my weight. Thanks for the Motivation!
I'm with everyone else who's saying ""Get Brian in on the World's Strongest Man,World's Smallest Car"" bit.
This is just too funny,especially to me,At 6'2"" and near 300lbs,I feel your back pain Eddie.
I think we all need to see Brian Shaw drive the worlds smallest car
Honestly, i kinda wanna see Eddie lift the Car. Like trying to benchpress, deadlift, squat that thing and so on 😂
@Eddie, *I'd love to see Max have a bit of safe fun in the tiny car. I believe he'd enjoy it as well. You should also post it to Max's channel as well. It would be brilliant!!*
I laugh my ass off everything I see you in this car. Need to try and go into a big supermarket.
See if you can convince a local race/go-kart track to let you take the car on for a spin, Eddie!
Loved it man the gym session was a good idea but I'd like to see you take the worlds smallest car to like a skate park or something like that lol
I think my depression would be healed immediately if I saw Eddie driving this thing in the middle of traffic out of nowhere
Eddie hall makes everything funny 😂 love you eddie ❤
Another amazing video! Eddie you are one amazing human who I look up to. Meeting you one day would complete my life. I'm forever grateful to you because you are the reason I'm still here right now. Having Cerebral Palsy is a daily challenge but you have taught me everything that I need to know about working out at the gym. The gym is hard enough let alone having poor hand control but I do it because you are the reason I started. Huge love Eddie and I'm sorry for your loss ❤
Would love to see you drive this on an ice rink. Or on a go kart track. Keep up the great work Eddie 👏🏻
Great content as always much love.   Should drive it to Matt Armstrong’s garage and see if he can get it to be faster!
Went from world’s strongest man to needing wheelchair accessible ramps and he’s still flexing it. This was both enlightening and inspiring to curl 💪🏽 the popcorn. 🥤

Bayern were 5-0 up at half time in this fixture last season. A slight improvement from Frankfurt this time.
this is incredible. Been a while since we saw Bayern Munich get manhandled like that
Ive always felt that Bayern are losing their potential with Tuchel. Even a Hansi Flick return is favourable.
the huge loss aside, that kimmich goal was out of the top draw 🔥
I know it’ll have made Harry Kane feel at home, but Bayern looked a bit Spursy there.
The fact that a German 3rd division team Saarbrücken beat Bayern and Frankfurt at the DFB Pokal is way more shocking 😱
That second goal tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You would think that after 123 years of playing this game, they would know that, as well as knowing how to attack, you also have to know when and how, to defend.
For years, that Bayern Defense has been no where near good enough and the only Manager recently that has really got away with it, was Flick.
That was simply awful and a bad, bad loss.
The opportunity was lost to go top and play many more game like that and we might as well kiss the Bundesliga and the CL goodbye. I would also like to know what Tuchel has against Thomas Muller.
He really should be playing a lot more.
On a footnote: Upamecano has to go, he really is not learning.
I want alonso’s Leverkusen to be the team to finally dethrone Bayern Munich but was not expecting this 1st defeat in league
before you haters start saying that kane has cursed bayern, its not kanes fault this happened, it was tuchels horrific tactics that caused this to happen. Bayern had these problems last season and kane wasnt even at the club. Kane has been made as a scapegoat for Bayerns problems. Tuchel has clearly ruined bayern
United losing 3-0 at home to Bournemouth now Bayern losing 5-1 - great way to head into their big clash in ucl midweek
Kane not winning a trophy at Bayern would be cruel, but also beautiful poetry.
Can you imagine if the first season Kane comes and scores loads of goals Bayern don't win anything 🤣🤣
Brilliant and hilarious. It's about time that Bayern were brought down to earth. 😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂😂
Frankfurt were unstoppable! 🔥
5-1 against Frankfurt got Kovac sacked, shame this 5-1 won't get Tuchel sacked. I hate the way we fired Nagelsmann and I really didn't want Tuchel. He's turned the team into a mess and the matches aren't pretty to watch. I'd like to think he'd get sacked before the end of the season but I feel like getting knocked out of the CL AND Leverkusen winning the Bundesliga is the only thing that'll get him sacked after we embarrassed ourselves sacking Nagelsmann only to get knocked out of the CL and nearly lose the Bundesliga under, you guessed it, Tuchel..
Woah! Bayern's first loss of the season, and it's a heavy one! The forwards seemed frustrated and clumsy.
This happens in football, Frankfurt are a decent team especially on the break. I think the key for Bayern is to get the first goal in matches, be patient no way Leverkusen will keep it going
I swear something like this happens to Bayern every season",17,Sports,348000,PT4M54S

US vs UK Christmas Special 2023 | Food Wars | Insider Food",232,"Love watching these Christmas specials every year. Thanks guys!
43:47 this is true, there's plenty of historical evidence such as recipes from Tudor courts like Henry VIII's and from mentions in food available at places like Shakespeare's Globe Theatre that ""Mince"" pies DID originally have Minced Beef (still spiced with Christmas spices like Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Cloves) the fruit only versions were much later to coincide with sweet food desires of the Georgian (1700s) period, and as a way for the wealthy to show off that they could afford expensive fresh fruit to go into pies (rather than mince which is made from the cheapest cuts of meat) which over time became cheaper to be made.

Back in the days of the original Mince pie though the pastry wasn't as sweet or crumbly and would instead have been more like the hard pastry of a Melton Mowbray style ""pork pie""
Thanks for doing these specials every christmas guys - really enjoy them!
Yay! I've been waiting for this Special since last year's edition! Amazing Hosts and fun show to watch!
My takeaways on the Starbucks section, as a US Starbucks barista: 1) Glad to have gingerbread lattes back (didn’t have them for 3 years), but still salty that the UK has eggnog and we don’t; 2) Surprised gingerbread loaf and snowman cookies are only available in some regions of the US. I have them in my store (in the San Francisco Bay Area); and 3) Bring back South Pole Sam and North Pole Nat, Starbucks UK! Why you gotta do Harry dirty like that? 🥺
This was quite the wholesome episode 🎉☃️❄️
43:38 It is made with mincemeat, but it is not made with *minced meat.*

Mincemeat (just like its cousin sweetmeat) uses a much earlier definition of ""meat"" that simply meant ""food in general"" rather than specifically animal-based food. It’s only now the original secondary definition of meat has become the dominant one that mincemeat and sweetmeat seem like misnomers, but they’re really not. They’re simply using an earlier definition of the word ""meat"" that no longer really survives outside of those two specific cases.
Fun exclusive holiday fact: the Elf Krispy Kreme in the UK actually have an exclusive Christmas tree donut that we don't have in our US Elf donuts.
I see Joe has a similar opinion to me with Reeces...any ""shaped"" Reeces taste horrible, but I love the regular ones.
Nico should try the regular nutty buddy. It is covered in chocolate. They taste loads better than the shaped Reeces. I like butterfinger, but they are difficult for me to eat these days...I would much prefer a nutty buddy over the butterfinger.
This continues to be an excellent series! However, it's a shame when some things aren't tried by the presenters. One of the key selling points of Food Wars is watching the hosts put their body through real torture in the name of telling us how things taste 🤣
good episode , had popeye for first time cple weeks ago liked it  even had an american buscuit with cajun gravy , im a big fan of america biscuits and there other alter ego as scones  , i see dominos do a turkkey pizza but had pizza xpress xmas pizza cple awhile ago and that blew me away how nice it is but as im having pheasant breast for xmas with bread sauce and all trimings i guess expecting pheasantr burger out of question can u clarify eggnog latte i couldnt find it advertised so bought own syrup and my friend whose a barrista in indianna srabucks said its off menu in usa
After Eight mints were a staple of the holidays at my house. It was a treat when my mom would pick some up at random times of the year too.
The Starbucks gingerbread got chai is indeed really good. The only other thing I've tried in this video is the cranberry Sprite and it's very mediocre. It's more sour apple flavored than cranberry flavored to me.
UK here and my family usually have a baked camembert for a starter before xmas dinner. I dunno how widespread that tradition is, but McDonald's picking camembert as the xmas cheese makes sense to me
These christmas episodes are always good Insider Food 👍
A 45 minute episode!! We are in for a treat guys!
Happy holidays and merry Christmas to the entire Food Wars team and community.

Great to see Tony's is alot more confident infront of the camera. Owning the channel when Matt isn't there. Really well done team 👏
Man Tony is a riot. Love your dad. He deserves his own channel !
Matt, your dad is a funny man, a pleasure to watch and his energy is amazing. I wouldn't mind spending a day in the garage with him, it'd definitely be a good laugh 😂
You can drain the torque converter (there is a rubber cover on the bottom of the bellhousing which exposes a small plug in the torque converter, you may have to rotate the engine to find it, some 722.9 transmissions had drain plugs which were the later trans) do all this at the same time as you change the filter, remove both cooler pipes and blow out the cooler lines as well this will help the convertor drain as well, the little green tube you can actually just knock it into the transmission sump (usually breaks) which will help drain 99% of the oil, I only use the Merc trans oil it's green in colour just quote the VIN to mercedes dealer, I think the manual states a 6 or 7 litre refill, I always get 8 litres, when you refit the filter and the green oil level tube to the sump, simply pump in about 5 liters of oil, start run for 30 seconds, shutoff pump in the remainder of oil, then start run through all forward and reverse gears, then using your diagnostic tool get up the trans oil temp, I think from memory wait until oil temp is at 45 degrees c, shutdown engine and check the level of the trans sump if oil pours out wait until its just dripping, if no oil pours out add more oil until the oil is just dripping out of sump plug hole.

Remember the green tube sets the level of the transmission at 45 Degrees C
Mat your dad is a pleasure to watch. What a wonderful human being, so happy and jovial all the time!
Love watching Mat and the team even when Mats not around. You guys have a great thing going on there!
It's easy to see why Mat turned out to be such a glorious human being just by watching his dad for a few moments.
Absolutely love your dads energy, what a nice chap, hope to see him more doing videos by himself haha, btw love your work matt, keep it up!❤
The relationship between you, dad, camera man, and your fan base is truly something to strive towards. Inspirational.
These 2 deserve their own mini series an absolute funny entertaining duo 😂
Great to see you guys enjoying your sim rig, especially with the motion! That said, it'll be easier to drive if you calibrate your steering wheel so that it doesn't rotate more in-game than in reality...
we need more Dad and friends videos like these.  It's pretty clear that the relaxed and positive and happy personality rubbed off on Mat.  you are all awesome
Your dad is just the best part off the channel !!! He does bring the joy to every bad situation!!!
I love it when Tony does a video, there's never a dull moment that's for sure. You can't help but love the guy, Tony your an absolute LEGEND!!!
Your dad is a freaking legend. Always so happy. More videos with just him!
I haven't known you and your dad for a long time now, but ever since I started watching you and saw your relationship with him I fell really happy just to see him on your videos, it was really a pleasure to see a whole video of his like it was his channel, I really hope to see more of those, I am sure you are gonna love rewatching these videos in the future with your future kids, these things are eternal, so keep creating great memories with your dad, we love it and we know you guys love it aswell.

#DoctorWho #60thAnniversary #TheGiggle #Review",2522,"I think people are missing the main take away here: when the Bi-generation happened 14's clothing was divided between them and 15 got the underwear, so 14 spent that entire time commando
I don't mind the bigeneration. I instantly assumed the 14th would become ""The Curator"".  The 50th special introduced him and was stated he was the doctor who retired, and now the 60th showed his origin. To me, The Doctor  wouldn't willing retire knowing there were people out there that needed help,  but now with the bigeneration 14th can retire and become The Curator and live a ""peaceful"" (for The Doctor) life, and the 15th Doctor can continue saving the universe.
I love the idea that bi-regeneration was a myth, meaning that Tennant’s salt at the end of the universe also made the myth come into being.
From 1966 and Tom Campbell in Dalek Invasion Earth, to 2023 and Wilfred Mott, Bernard Cribins deserves his eternal recognition in Dr Who history.
For me, it wasn't the mention of River Song that buckled my knees... It was them finally acknowledging that Sarah Jane is gone.
Also, how lovely that Donna's story comes full circle. Following on from her advice to the Doctor at the end of The Runaway Bride (""Sometimes you need somebody to stop you.""), she's the person who gets him to stop running and build a 'found family' on Earth.
SO excited for the ncuti era!
I liked how it paid off Tennant’s seemingly bitter frustration in his first regeneration. He wasn’t ready to go, and wanted to do so much more. This time he was ready to let go and move on, but kinda poetically: he was allowed to have his happy ending after saving the world.
This episode had a horror element, a sci fi element, a history element, a cosmic wonder element, an interpersonal familial element. This episode had everything Dr Who has been known for
There's a brief line where Ncuti tells Tennant that he's whole and healthy because Tennant took the time to get whole and healthy. Time Lords doing therapy out of order. Makes me think that when Tennant dies, his regeneration will pull him out of spacetime and drop him in his past, back at the 60th anniversary, to the moment Ncuti appeared. Its not that there are 2 Doctors now...technically as a time traveler all his incarnations are around at all times, its that the regeneration happened out of order. Personally I like this.
The “best two of three” really takes a double meaning with the two doctors beating the toy maker!
Thank you for touching on the absolute bs we ambulatory (we use that word vs ""full time"" users- ""confined"" is generally outdated) wheelchair users get from ignorant people. Shirley is a great character, definitely deserved her 'up'! Also love Kate and the scene between them was well done :)
This was the best episode in a long long time, Neil Patrick Harris was just outstanding in his role and it felt like everyone else upped their game accordingly. Ncuti Gatwa also did a great job, I felt like he just slipped straight into the role, here's hoping he gets some great stories and writing that he can make the most of.
Can I just say what a joy Ncuti Gatwa is? I am ALWAYS reticent about the new Doctor, but he won me over the second he took Tennant in his arms and said ""I got you."" I was like, yes, he's the Doctor. He is someone who just lights up a room. Capaldi will always be my #1 (Smith, to date, is #2) but I am looking forward to what Ncuti will offer us. I'm excited to see where we go from here. BRAVO RTD, you won me back from when I walked away (I thought permanently till now) from the dregs of the Chibnal era!
Loved the episode and I feel that the bi-generation was made possible by the Toy Maker bringing his rules to our universe. Also, to me,  Ncuti Gatwa instantly felt like the Doctor, like when Matt Smith started. No need to get a couple of episodes to feel it with the others.
The Giggle was perfect. This was truly the first of these specials that felt like a celebration of 60 years of Doctor Who. I loved the framing device of John Logie Baird and the invention of television. Really reminded me of that episode from series 2 about Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation. It had all these great callbacks and mentions to so many characters, most if not all of whom are no longer accessible to the Doctor like Amy and Rose Tyler. Is it wishful thinking to hope that no mention of Martha means Freema Agyeman will pop up again soon? Even though it's very clear that she wasn't mentioned because she lived a happy life and their story didn't end tragically. Neil Patrick Harris was fantastic! I loved the switching of accents. Evil camp is always fun, especially when it’s as sinister as this was. And the “Spice Up Your Life” dance sequence. I still have no idea what the hell bi-generation means. I mean we heard from all the Doctors previously in the reboot that regeneration was super dodgy but making a whole new one is not a twist I was expecting! But this establishes that in a one-on-one-hundred-million-billion-billion chance, Time Lords can reproduce asexually. However how many times can the Doctor make a copy of themselves? The end fight with the Toymaker had the frenetic pace of Ten's fight with the Sycorax way back in 2006. I loved Ncuti’s energy. He really felt like a showman, much more than the other Doctors previously. And because they said he processed his trauma, Fifteen seems like he’s going to be a Doctor who is having fun and not haunted by his dark deeds or running from something. Which is a Doctor RTD never gave himself the chance to write. It's like  Fourteen was supposed to go on this journey of trauma healing and at the end regenerate into the happy and fun Fifteen but the Toymaker got in the way. And it looks like we have another RTD mystery box on our hand with The Meep’s boss still left unanswered and now the Toymaker’s “The One Who Waits.” Let’s face it, it’s probably The Meep’s boss. I love that Fourteen’s costume got split between the two so Fifteen spends the entire episode in underwear! But because he got the shows, not only does Fourteen speed the entire 3rd act barefoot and commando, which is hilarious in and of itself, Fifteen feels even more naked. Donna’s “Do you come in a range of colors” is perfect because it addresses Ncuti’s blackness without making it a big deal. _Because It’s not!_ I love that they let Ncuti keep his true accent.  I love that we didn’t have to say goodbye to Tennant again. Not really. That scene of him having lunch with Donna's family, really his family, was just perfect and I'm happy that his last words are technically “I’ve never been so happy in my life."" You can really hear Tennant’s Scottish accent on “wheelchair accessible.” It really feels like they are setting up a UNIT spin-off. And I am here for it! I need it to be Kate, Shirley, Mel, and the Vlinx, whatever the hell that is, and maybe Osgood (fingers crossed).

The Doctor’s bi-generation means that if Michael Sheen ever played the Doctor (hopefully as Sixteen) then Sheen and Tennant (as Fourteen) can share the screen.
I loved this episode. The Doctor has seen and felt so much pain and loss, and has himself lost so much, and he's been running from that pain for so long. The Doctor deserves a rest, and deserves happiness, and now he finally gets it. While 14 gets to rest and heal, 15 will be carrying on the job of protecting the universe. I know I've seen complaints about the bi-regeneration, and complaints that Ncuti's 15 didn't get to properly shine by having an episode to himself when he debuted, but I disagree. I think he shined mightily. The impression I got is that when he separated from Tennant's 14, 15 left behind much of that guilt and pain, effectively unburdening the Doctor of much of his trauma, while 14 will go about healing from it all, and get to enjoy life with people he cares about and who care about him. In this way both Doctors get to recover, and live happier lives. If my interpretation is correct, that means the new series of Doctor Who will see a happier, more playful Doctor, which I think is a wonderful new direction for the show. It now makes sense that they are referring to the time of the 15th Doctor as series/season 1 of Doctor who, because we are getting, in effect, a brand new Doctor, in more ways than one. Not just a new face, but a revitalized, renewed Doctor. I cry tears of joy knowing that the Doctor is getting a much deserved rest and reward, while simultaneously going forward as a happier, healthier person. It is truly the best of both worlds for The Doctor, and I look forward to watching the Christmas Special and the new series, as well as whatever spinoffs they produce, especially if that means we get both Donna and 14 together as well as the adventures of 15. But even if we never get to see Donna and 14 again, I'm happy knowing that he is happy, and look forward to the adventures of 15 with bated breath. At least in regards to Doctor Who, we are living on the best of timelines. Now if only the rest of the world would follow suit. Thank you David Tennant and Catherine Tate for your return for these specials, and a hearty welcome to Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor, and a thank you also to the rest of the cast of The Giggle. Thank you Sean for the Ups & Downs, as well as the rest of the WhoCulture crew who worked on this. Bernard Cribbins, we miss you and love you. Live Long and Prosper, and Allons-y!
As a wheelchair, user with cerebral palsy, the ramp, now being on the tardis, and all the inclusion in all of the specials, just makes my heart so full! I can now truly feel feel like I’m a part of one of my favorite franchises! The new cannon will take some getting used to but I really like what what happened here because I think the idea of all the doctors getting a happy ending instead of a sad one is really brilliant and open the door to make multi doctor stories make a lot more sense, i.e. it fully explains tales of tardis, for example. Neil was just amazing as the toymaker!
This episode was great. I agree that this was the role that Neal Patrick Harris was born to play. Ncuti already has shown he can hold his own against Tennant and I can't wait to see to how his team as the doctor goes. I'm excited. Catherine and David are so good together, I will miss them but I also love that there is a way for them to come back. I'm also excited for the rest of the Toymaker's Legion, the return of the Master, and the mysterious female hand that got the tooth. I also think thanks to Bi-generation, this is how the Doctor... or a version of the Doctor will now become the Curator. By Who knows. *taps noses*
I just realized on a rewatch of the giggle the significance of the 14th Doctor not wearing the running shoes after the Bi-generation signifying his end to running. I love the level of detail put into this show.",24,Entertainment,169000,PT33M30S

The videos of you & Lorna Jane were totally heart-warming. That 2 people can just be OK with hanging-out, being themselves & how you supported & were such nice company for her in the vans, on the boat etc. Yes, you have to do adverts & cover all sorts of stuff but you do it in a way that's natural, fallible & very nice - reason being, you are also a very nice chap....an all-round good egg, but also...a talented film-maker in your own way. These videos take work, and yours come across as if they don't take any work; the sign of a good editor, camera-man & writer. You are a genius David, I meant what I said! Check out Roger Barns & his cruising dinghy videos, you kind of remind me of him....but you're also nothing like him!

Lovely to hear those tones of outraged relish as you relate the numerous fixes she needs, and to see as well as hear your unalloyed joy that Twiggy's there for you. Your happiness makes us happy. Thanks for sharing it.
What a lovely tour of your new spidercraft! Er I mean runabout.  :D  She's very pretty and quirky.  Thanks for the in-depth look!  I can see why you fell in love with Twiggy.
David with a twinkle in his eye talking about repairing a boat. The order of life is restored.
Love your new adventure!
Imagine taking this little boat out across the wash like you did a narrow boat once. Now that would be an adventure 😁
I just love your new boat and so happy that you’re enjoying the canals again.
If you are going to be doing any fiber glassing, you could raise the level of that area in front of the outboard by a 1/4 inch or so to make the water funnel out the drain hole better.
You are the master of telling the way it is, in such a uplifting and inspiring way. Thanks for the promised tour, I could not help smiling carefully 😮😂
Thanks for the tour of the boat David 😊 I'm so glad that you're back on the water and I look forward to more canal stories and updates on your improvements to  the boat . Thanks for sharing,  keep the videos coming and safe travels 🙏
David, you are absolutely correct- ‘it is a fun little boat’. It definitely has lots of potential, and with the TLC  you are willing to give it, it will provide years of pleasurable boating. No doubt when you have completed most of the fixes, you’ll be grinning inwardly on the canals as you skim past all those naysayers. Cheers for now.
I suggest you put the solar panel over the engine aft and hinge it so it can fold down or angle towards the sun. That would free up the hatch.
A bit rough around the edges but Twiggy is full of potential. 
Obviously you’re going to relocate the electrics under the hob and fit a water tank under the sink.  As for matching the color after repairs I wouldn’t sweat that and just have the entire boat repainted which would cover a multitude of sins. Enough advice, you enjoy a challenge and you’re quite good at fashioning solutions so have at it and enjoy your new boat.
Thanks, David, for your tour of ""Twiggy."" No repairs you can't handle, and it will be fun, as always, watching you fix it up and make it your own. Thanks again and keep smiling!
David's trying his best to play the curmudgeon while pointing out all the things that need fixing, but we all know that inside he's rubbing his hands together excitedly in anticipation of all the DIY projects he gets to enjoy in bringing Twiggy up to CtC standards.  Just as we're all rubbing our hands together excitedly in anticipation of all the videos he's going to make while engaging in said DIY projects.  🤣

You've got a great boat with a lot of potential, and we're looking forward to seeing your progress!  Thanks for sharing!
The thing I like about this boat is that, while it is certainly a project, it is also perfectly functional:  plenty of stuff that needs doing, but on days when you don’t feel like doing you can just go happily mess about in your boat!😊 Thank you for the lovely tour!

(On a side note, it is rather nice to occasionally see other people asking “but why” when they’re working on something old.  I’ve been working on my old farmhouse for a number of years and I still come across things that make me wonder what the previous owners were thinking!)
Buy a water bladder for the water supply.  It will conform to the space that you have available, and you can fill it with a hose from a dockside tap.  If you relocate the battery bank to the opposite side, they should counter balance one another.
Hi David.  It is very good to see you back on the water.  A place you are meant to be - especially with a boat needing quite a bit of handymanning.  We always enjoy your videos showing how you overcome all problems with a bit of thought, a few materials and stuff you buy from Amazon.  It's DIY as an art form!!  That combined with your excellent storytelling, great use of video and deadpan humour makes our day.  Thank you.
I'm trying to image the proud owners on their first day taking delivery of this little vessel, and what an exciting time it would have been.
I’m loving this. Reminds me of a boat my wife and I went to look at some years ago, except that yours is immaculate in comparison. It actually steers reasonably, without constantly spinning the wheel left and right like a lunatic to try and keep it straight!! Looking forward to the next episode.",22,People & Blogs,243000,PT20M25S

the fortune tellers saying jaiden would have 3 kids is suddenly making a lot more sense.
GOOD JOB ARI AND TOFU WOOOO LETS GOOOO

If you want to keep the eggs and want to move them out of the freezer you can also encase them in resin as a memento of her laying eggs without running the risk of accidentally breaking them in the freezer or having them explode. Cause normal eggs can explode in the freezer and idk if it would be harder or easier to explode tiny eggs like that.
If you go back and watch Ari's first birthday there's a great segment that goes along the lines of "" I don't know Ari's gender the only way to really know is a DNA test unless it's too late and you already have eggs everywhere""
For anyone wondering, there are two types of birds: nesting and non-nesting. A nesting bird's babies are called ""nestlings"" and (when first hatched) are SUPER fragile, needs constant food, cannot walk or fly, is completely featherless and takes longer to mature. A non-nesting bird's babies are just called ""chicks"" and (when first hatched) can walk, don't need constant food, cannot fly and has a ""fuzzy"" coat that keeps them warm independantly of their mother.

Chickens, turkeys, quail, pheasants, ducks, geese etc. all give birth to ""chicks"", which is why you may be thinking that baby birds are easy to care for. They kinda just figure out life on their own. Nestling birds need special equipment, foods and sometimes medicines to be raised by humans. You need to feed them every 4-6 hours with a syringe, keep them warm and keep them hydrated (which is harder to do when they are kept warm). For the duration of their infancy, you basically have to nap instead of sleep, or have a second person assist you as you both plan your sleep schedules to do a 12/12 shift. You need to take care of them for something or rather EVERY 3 HOURS, ON THE HOUR. Raising a bird seems really cool, but don't raise a nestling unless you know EVERYTHING about the species you are trying to raise.
Tip: if you want to know if the eggs are fertilized or not just put a flashlight over them and look if there is any red spots over the yellow gold.
Jaiden: ""I hope they get along""
The birds: ""bubble gum electric""
As a female cockatiel owner egg binding is a scary concept. I’ve been told calcium supplements and a vet visit to remove any stuck eggs is fine but still. So, Sol’s cage has no possible nesting spots and when she’s out of it she’s always with me so it’s all good 👍🏼 

Sol is such a personable sweetheart, I adore her. She demands head scritches from everyone (including the VET lol) and hates hates hates raisins. Like will literally throw them out of her feed hates them. Learned that the first time when I was hand feeding her bits of her feed and she bounced it off my knee XD

As for the sawdust comment, I can 100% believe that. Sol had a toy meant for the parakeets my twin and I used to have before they passed but never ended up giving it to, and she adored it. She cronched that thing like cookie wafer - sounded like it too. Anyway, the moment it stopped being an out of cage toy and I hung it up inside said cage it got absolutely demolished very quickly, and there was just woodchips. Everywhere. SO many woodchips. I swear the thing should not have produced that many but it did

I adore birds, they’re my favorite kind of pet. But I am very consciously aware that a cockatiel is my best match and not, say, a conure or heaven forbid, an actual parrot. And that’s okay. Also Jaiden is 110% correct raising baby birds is a NIGHTMARE. I would’ve done the same thing, as would many other bird owners. Google it if you don’t believe us. Back on topic though, while in my opinion birds make for the best kind of pet you need to take into account whether or not you are able to give them the time and attention they need. Know what you can and cannot do, and if you can’t that’s okay. Know your limits. But don’t get a bird if you can’t take care of it properly, it’ll just end in tears 

So, to sum it up: egg binding is scary, Sol is the best (sorry not sorry Ari and Tofu), bird sawdust is real, raising baby birds is a nightmare, and birds make for the best pets if and ONLY if you’re able to meet their needs, and there’s nothing wrong with you if you can’t. Just don’t get a bird if so
Pray for Jaden that she doesn’t lose her mind from taking care of lots of birds
As an ER vet who sees birds, I agree with 100% of your sentiments about bird ownership at the end. Loved the video, very humorous but also spreading the truth about bird ownership.
My friend had three parakeets in the past.. the mother died naturally and then the daughter unalived her father.. glad to see Tofu and Ari are well 😅
I love Jaiden’s pet videos about her feathered babies. Hopefully she makes one for Tostada the kitty cat one day too
0:15 i just wanna mention how nice this depiction of this fanbase is. All just calmly cheering for Ari. i love this depiction because fans of any media these days sometimes are portrayed as rabidly obsessed creatures with no sense of reason. and it hurts when you're part of that fanbase. it really shows the maturity of her team and of Jaidens fans. i commend you all. this really is such a lovely, mature and respectful community.
as a long time fan, this is crazy to watch. never would i have thought ari would become a dad. or a mom.
As a cat owner of the most gremlin, crazy cats, I laughed so hard at this video. Pet owners of the pets who destroy things but who you love dearly truly understand where you’re coming from 😂
As a green cheek conure owner: Piccolo and Bansuri are some of the best things that ever happened to me, I regret nothing, and simultaneously they’re the bane of my existence.

Great video.  The hotel is  looking really good.  The water  dowser was entertaining but my vote is for the hydrogeologist.
It’s crazy to watch how much progress you’ve made since 2020 the town looks great
We love your videos Brent, they dont all have to be well planned like they all are. You could just hit record at any time and we will watch and love them all the same. Thanks for being a content creator
I'm not an expert hiker or trail blazer, but I think it would be worth while to put a guide rope or cable on the steep or loose gravel areas of that new trail.  It would be safer for anyone that want's to see that beautiful view of the valley.  Keep up the fantastic work Brent.  I'm hoping to be able to get to Cerro Gordo within the next couple of years.  Till then, I look forward to more and more video updates!
Brent, you are literally and metaphorically a trailblazer. Blazing a trail was the act of marking the trees (leaving stone cairns) on a route for others to follow. Looking forward to reading your book at my home in the surfcoast here in Oz. Happy festive season mate
There’s nothing I want more than to go exploring in the mines with you
There’s something magical about the Sierras. I was fortunate enough to live at 9200 ft for a couple summers at Lake Sabrina. You can almost feel the mountains growing in the still of the morning. The calm and quiet of being away from the annoying noise of a city is priceless.
Yes! Dan is awesome! Love his channel so glad he’s made an appearance
Bravo, Brent!  I'm so proud to have watched your first episodes of ""Ghost Town Living"" way back in 2020.  I never stopped!  Best channel on You Tube!  It never gets old!  Thanks so much for preserving history and taking us along for the ride.  I WILL get to Cerro Gordo one day and visit.  Congratulations on a great month and Merry Christmas!
Hey Brent what you are doing at Cerro Gordo is just simply amazing. I am  a retired water treatment, production and distribution manager that has ventured into the hard rock gold mining hobby and I am looking forward to visiting your playground here in the near future to explore the towns mining history.  Thanks again for sharing your wonderful videos, I am envious of your accomplishments!!
Cerro Gordo is too far away for me to visit unfortunately, but I'd love to visit if I had the chance. Your work there is so inspiring and you patience is something we can all learn from. It's amazing to see a ghost town be brought back to life, especially since ghost towns will become more common as time moves on.
I’ve been watching since before the hotel burnt down and I’m so glad that it’s being rebuilt as well as your spirit and strength with pushing thorough obstacles
Brent, your videos are awesome dude and your adventure has been so pleasing to watch I never miss an episode. I would love to visit one day I am on the other side of the country but man everything seems so fun . Maybe one day I could get a chance to live in your town or build a vacation home to get away from all the craziness lol what you are building is amazing man hopefully I can visit in the near future. Cheers
Brett, you are truly an inspiration to me, and I'm sure many others. I admire your commitment to you're amazing project that you have taken upon yourself with the help of others. you have outstanding perseverance!!
It pleases me to pre-order your book. I now feel like I am just a small part of your world. I hope to visit and meet you someday.
   It is amazing that you have found your place in this world. And even more amazing that you are preserving history.
Blessings to you and your passions!!!
I think hiking trails are a great idea, that scenery is a resource you can mine endlessly. Some choice camping spots would seem like a good fit too, especially once you get a good supply of water on tap. Then the town could serve as a base camp, so you could offer the experience of camping in the extreme desert wilderness while still being conveniently close to help and supplies.
Wow, what an incredible journey exploring an abandoned ghost town! Your determination and enthusiasm for discovering hidden treasures like gold and water are truly inspiring. The way you uncover the history and explore the nooks and crannies of these forgotten places is both fascinating and captivating. Keep up the amazing work, and looking forward to more thrilling adventures like this one! and please release your book to indian market as well.",22,People & Blogs,1670000,PT34M2S

Without body you look like rayman... considering he's apparently a secret agent and extremely cool. Using his floating detatched hands really effectively. That's a compliment... but you lost your ""looking like one of the strongest video game characters"" status when you got arms... also it was in an anime. So cool. Rayman is an anime character now.

I made this an in depth as possible to answer ALL of your questions; hopefully I got them all. Which Hero Equipment will you be using for your strategy?

Here's the thing, the new wall levels take 9M for a single piece. But there are 11 troops that can completely avoid walls, 4 which can shoot over walls. There is a jump and an earthquake spell, 2 heroes which can avoid walls and now this new earthquake gear
I actually like this change because for me, the archer queen's spawned units were usually detrimental to her because they triggered aoe defenses to kill her while invisible.
Im a little concerned about the epic equipment. Especially if its tied to events. It kind of gives pay to win vibes if its not always available.
I'm suspicious of the Epic equipment. If they are only available from special events, and much better than regular equipment, there's potential balance issues.
2:43 those Ore numbers are spectacular
Clash of clans is sure undergoing a massive change. Absolutely excited to try these upcoming changes. Thank you Judo for always keeping us updated with juicy COC contents ❤❤.
I think this is really cool but I am worried about the progression grind to get hero equipment up to a higher level. I really hope that levelling up your gear doesn’t take ages and ages. 

Additionally, I am VERY afraid of having “epic” gear that’s limited. I really hope that isn’t something that’s done because it would mean for the first time that gameplay and ways to play the game would be behind rewards that not everyone will get. Anything limited atm is purely aesthetic, and doesn’t impact your ability to play the game vs anyone else. I hope they keep that in mind
I hope they make the prep time attacks to 60 secs and you could change your heroes gear just like siege machines before attacking, so you could startegize even further
for me, this is just an amazing feature, and something I would rlly like to be added would be for the warden to escencially use different kinds of spell effects (cuz we can see that he can either heal or rage the other troops), by that knowledge, I think it might be very cool and at the same time fun and chaotic (like for example imagine just turn everything invisible or cloned or stuff like that)
The vampire mustache, rage crystal, and spirit fox on the barbarian king is going to be unstoppable. 4 seconds of rotating invisibility while healing at 300 per hit and he can rage up if DPS gets too high… can’t wait to try it out
Great stuff as ever! Will you be doing an upgrade priority guide? I know with most new TH levels it's the usual routine of TH, Lab, CC, Storages, Army Camps etc but this feels very different (and exciting!) e.g. with the Blacksmith. Would love some guidance.
I really hope they make it so that you can choose when to activate the equipment seperately. For instance, using the big arrow at the beginning then using invisibility later on
It’s nice that they made updates for lower town halls as well instead of just th16/15 changes
Thanks for all the sneak peak videos judo. Appreciate all the great content you bring to the table
Explaining the different attack strategies with the new update is very helpful for preparation, thanks!
With the epic equipment for events, as long as it doesn’t require money to get I think will be such a good idea. Make everyone play the events to the max to get special equipment can really increase the amount of people coming back and daily play
This is so awesome, its great to see more than just the newest townhall get new content.These are gonna change the game a lot, and it also adds a lot of new options for them to add cool new gears.
This is phenomenal & provides you with ample content opportunities!  You could make a playlist of current & old strategies and how to gear the heroes to update/enhance those strats!  I'll be watching!",20,Gaming,2730000,PT19M30S

#ManUnited #ManchesterUnited #MUFC",2747,"The pain in his eyes. You’re not alone brother.
The worst thing is this isn’t rock bottom yet… Bayern and the scoucers to come, heads will roll this week
I’m 80 years old - 1st match at Old Trafford in 1955.  My club is unrecognizable - I’m with Andy 100%.  The Glazers have wrecked this club, not just the infrastructure but the whole ethos.  Unconscionable - we have had difficult times with our  teams over the years but the Glazers are not just wrecking the team, they are dismantling the club!
This guy is the real man. Working class, top englishman, lives for his family. The way he speaks about his family, the way he loves this club. We all live and breath United, these players are a disgrace, they dont represent anything we belive in. Just want to live another league title with my dad, but these players are not gonna give us that.
I feel sorry for Andy but know exactly how he feels. I’m 74 and seen a lot of ups and downs at United these last 60 plus years. You will bounce back Andy and support your team irrespective of the shocking standards that some of these players are displaying. Have a great Christmas my friend and we will smile again. I promise you.
I’m a Liverpool fan but always enjoyed Andy’s passion - I’m really sorry for him tonight … hope he bounces back - we all have these days but we are all supportive of each other regardless of the team 👍
Unlike a lot of “fans” that appear on fan tv channels Andy Tate is a real one. Wears his heart on his sleeve, loves his football, calls/tells it as he see’s it. A proper football fan that is purely on here to share his thoughts and opinion, not on for the views or popularity. A man that looks like his club has finally broken him! Enjoy your Christmas lad.
This is deep. I swear I felt pain listening to Andy Tate pour out his emotions like we all feel. Ten Hag might not survive Christmas.
he spoke nothing but what EVERY man united feels right now, big up Andy
Heartbreaking to see Andy yesterday - I understand him. United is our life. Been a United supporter for over 50 years since i was a kid. United's dreams has always been our dreams - it's so hard to grasp - that we have come to this. 70's was not all joy, but i never doubted Sammy, Bryan, Greenhoff brothers, big Gordon (rip) etc...they were all my heroes . ❤️🤍🖤
This is not the Manchester United I used to know. I really feel for Andy Tate. I can see that he's close to tears and this shows how much he loves United. I personally have been supporting Manchester United for well over two decades. This result ranks among the very WORST I have seen so far. This should not be happening anywhere United plays not to talk of this disaster happening at Old Trafford! The Glazers have done so much damage to the Club. I am sad at what I am witnessing. Very horrible time to be a Manchester United supporter.😑
Why hasn't anyone said how well Bournemouth defended?! players sliding into stopping every ball! Masterclass!
We were in their face up front but had no chance because of this!
Newcastle fan here but this is the best fan reactions I have ever see. Passion and you can see the absolute devastation in his eyes. The start of the video was just🔥🔥🔥
I’m a Blue and I’m not going to lie. Andy Tate was always a figure of fun to me. However, I genuinely feel his pain here. All rivalries aside. The hardcore Manc Reds deserve better than the tripe this lot are serving up.
Happy birthday for this week Andy.
I honestly think it’s the training. It’s like the players are all questioning or second guessing every single thing they do in a game. Like Onana who spends a good 10-15 minutes per game passing the ball around the back 4 to show/prove he’s good with his feet. Like Scott who somehow can’t pass a ball 6 yards. I mean - look at these same players playing for their countries - for example Bruno and Dalot are excellent for Portugal and they come back and they’re suddenly crap. I think this is on the manager unfortunately. Ten Hag could have Cantona, Schmeichel, Giggs, Cole, Robson, Keane, Vidic, Stam etc. and I think we’d see the same. I know the wide players frustrate us sometimes, but it feels like he gives them free rein and end up looking shite because no one else is running, afraid to get the ball and make a mistake. Same with Bruno too I think. The back line - I think Maguire is suddenly looking good again because he’s chosen to go back to basics. It’s probably time the manager goes. At least he brought with him Martinez, so it’s not all been bad.
I saw how emotional you were after the match Andy,was sitting in front of you. Never saw someone so upset and could see your hurt,knocked me a bit to see ya that upset,was with my 9 year old son for the first time from Ireland and was emotional myself for him that that’s his first match he had to witness. Could feel the emotion of people and just the tiredness of everything from the fans.
I agree with everything you have said, I’m 72 years of age, followed MU since I was 8 years old, spent many thousands of dollars travelling to Old Trafford to watch them play from Australia. I was at last years Liverpool game coming away so so disappointed, I told my son after that game until they change the manager and players I’ll never go to another United game. Travelling to London next March and I’ll go see Tottenham play City at least I’ll see an exciting match and players that give supporters what they pay for “professional attitude, quality team spirit and managers that knows what they’re doing.
I think the lack of swearing but the heartfelt words make this all the more meaningful. He absolutely echoes what we all feel …. We are all sick and tired of it . And all we want at this stage is good honest , hardworking performances.
Not a United fan but I have to say that it’s sad to see the club where they are today. I hope that they can turn things around, their fans deserve better. YNWA
I feel so sorry for him, i dont even support man united, but like watching these lads because of the passion they have, you can see the pain 😊",17,Sports,728000,PT11M8S

And the rope/line twisting more and more tightly around his neck, cutting off his air.... He didn't have much time left, thank you for saving him!🙏❤
Oh my goodness, how on earth did that poor little seal drag that bucket around? That rope was so tight around its neck, you could see it expand when you cut it. Well done, guys, I don't know how much longer that baby seal could have survived. Another great rescue, a really good job.👍👍
Thank you all! Such lucky, happy little pups. That bucket was one of the deadliest I've seen you do! Great team work.
The little one dragging the bucket was so relieved and definitely seemed to understand he needed help and excepted it graciously.

Как хорошо, что есть такая команда, которая поможет и спасёт! Люблю вас всех! Спасибо за каждого!
😪No way the pup dragging that bucket behind him would have had a chance to survive in the water. Thanks OCN-team, for saving these two pups' lives!❤️🦭👏
#1 seal didn't have much time left, and what a horrible mess it had to deal with. #2 was another one of those ball lines that also would have lead to it's demise the way it was wrapped around the body. Thank you OCN for saving these babies, and talking to them in a way to help calm them down is always so cute! 
As someone with asthma, I know what the seals feel when they are able to breathe freely 😢😅😊 Thank you for y’all’s unswerving efforts to helping seals and other wildlife. Have a wonderful and safe, healthy holiday season 😊❤
Thank you for the work you do.  Its interesting and helps to inform the public what these animals go through just to survive.
Watched Seaspiracy last night--heartbreaking! Thank you all for helping fix this mess we've made of the oceans
THANK YOU to the entire OCN Team for everything you do to release the seals from those dangerous entanglements!
Well done. Two more little lives saved. ❤
The things those little guys pickup . Its a miracle they make it out of the water. Strong to be pulling a bucket around. Thank you for saving them.❤
I’ve been watching these heroes of the sea life for years and keep wondering when they will give up on the endless need for saving seals from ghost gear entanglements. But they persist, with skill and empathy week after week, year after year. So grateful
Congratulations on yet another amazing job.   Your doing work that should be paid for by the fishing industry.

I watched for the scream and it did not disappoint
Love how Olivia alternates between cheerfully soft and angrily tough vocals in this performance!  That applause was richly deserved.
guts was such a masterpiece! I can’t wait for next album! She literally never misses!
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances! 💜
This video demonstrates her creative ability so well. And how much she loves these sorts of performances shown at the start when she crushes the glass. ❤
Being in the audience this performance was legendary so was vampire, Olivia never ceases to amaze me 👏
Her breaking the glass part before the chorus is *FABULOUS* 💜💜💜
Also the scream part is WOW 😭😭😭 her voice there is gorgeous and she really did drop all her guts for that scream part
This is exactly what I would imagine an official mv for this song would be like, and the fact that she performed it live... just perfecf ❤
ok this performance was a MOMENT. also love how she didn’t break character once the song was over and was getting applause. she stood in that ATTITUDE — tongue out, cake on the face, those *eyes* glaring at you, the intensity… so perfect!
i love the way she can sing so lightly to someone who has been bottling up her emotions for a long time 💗
I love how this song labels exactly what it is to be a teenager. Teenage rage is like screaming on the inside meanwhile we're happy and cheerful on the outside. And I love the scream so much 😂😂 Thanks Olivia 💜💜
This performance is insane, Olivia is such a hard worker. Her voice, her emotions, the way she looks is PERFECT. I’m so grateful I am a teenage girl because of Olivia
She's not just another pop queen.  Besides pop, her music has some angst and an edge to it, which is awesome.  This performance was fantastic.
This is one of Olivia's best performances. I love how she combines her angelic vocals with her theatrical skills. So proud to see her evolving in live performances!
Olivia entregando talento como sempre
Being a fan since Sour...this album blown away my expectations, and the performance are just brilliant. I´m a metal and rock listener and Olivia instantly catch my attention with this rock way of her music. Hope to see a show of her someday. Great work!!
MEU DEUS QUE PERFORMANCE, ela quebrando a taça na virada da música ficou incrível
i’m so proud of her and her improvement in performance. watching her grow and succeeding makes me believe i can win at life too. 

i’m glad i’m going through my teenage years with her career existence and her music. she saved me when the sour album dropped, it meant a lot to me, at that time i’m in my lowest point. sour made me stronger and understood my messy feelings better. her songs are very  high emotional intelligence even though it was very angsty. 

it helped me deconstruct that lump in my heart like no one would understand, i was 16 in my room all day and night. because of tracks on sour, i can accept my jealousy towards other girls, i can relieve my anger towards my ex-boyfriend. some her lyrics are eerily  exactly like my situations, like his new girlfriend’s name sounds so much like mine, just slightly different.

i’m 18 now, i was so much happier than that time, i moved on. i forgive and forget. i have a lot of new friends and good memories. i got into a university and my studying great. just like she said she’s so much happier than the time when she wrote sour. i’m so happy for her and myself. 

hope she can do tour in my country!
please come to Asia. thank u!

Mother has mothered again
Sam hitting his head on the question block has got to be the funniest thing I've seen in a long time
You know it's gonna be a great day when Brandon uploads
I never knew that a minute long video could make me laugh so hard.  True comedic genius.
Sam is the type of homie everyone needs in their lives
Sam is what my anxiety will never allow me to do in public 💀
The way Brandon has no fear of being judged in public is just honestly incredible
""I thought you was dead!""
""Well honey legends never die!""
""That's.. that's total bullshit.""

DYING
I hope Brandon never stops dropping bits like this lol. I love the longer videos but bits like this are amazing for the ADHD brain.
“These trolls got holes” got me down on the floor dying out of laughter when you said! Brandon don’t stop what you’re doing!
1:07 That was just such a genuine reaction from Donna 😂
I wish I could fall asleep as fast as Sam can.😅
Also, Donna saying she can’t connect to the internet is super relatable.😂
Sam and Donna is the ultimate dynamic duo and I always love seeing them together
holy shit ""transphobiosa"" fucking hit me like a pile of bricks, literally laughed so hard i started seeing stars in my vision. (or maybe i would've seen stars anyways because there's something wrong with my eyes lol) just completely out of nowhere. i swear i can never get tired of this stuff, it's just too good.
The amount of confident this guy has to go into all these places just to say this stuff will never not make me smile. A modern comedic legend
okay, I love how you can tell that they are purposefully not talking loud, because of all the people around, but they still make their words clear, well done and absolutely hilarious
I love how fans were coming up and he just continued to stay in character 💀you are an absolute wonder, Brandon..
I hope Brandon and Paulette had a blast making this! I laughed so hard, I had to watch twice because I missed parts of it!

I'll never get over how much Nala loves Mark! It's too sweet
nothing more wholesome than mark and zoe's annual gift giving video ❤❤
Not me tearing up about the photo book! It just feels like we’ve been a part of this friendship forever and it’s so cool to see 🫶🏼
mark's immediate ""no✋🏻"" (19:27) is soo funny AND sooo endearing at the same time 😂🥺
It’s not Christmas without Mark and Zoe exchanging gifts!!!! Mark, you are doing amazing at Vlogmas!!! ❤❤❤❤
Mark, thank you for still allowing us to peep into your friendship with Zoe after all these years. To see this bloom and morph into you not only being a friend, but family member and now an uncle to her 2 littles is truly very special. We are lucky to have these moments and shared memories for years to come. 💛💛
obsessed with Nala sitting in the middle of you both just taking everything in 😭
Just want a friend like Mark tbh! I NEEEED that blanket you gave Zoe!
omg i've been feeling down in the dumps for the last 2 days and seeing a zoe and mark VLOGMAS vlog just made me cry happy tears LOL
Mark getting all emotional for Zoe + Alfie growing their family. :') 
Imagine having had Mark as an ""uncle"" when growing up. Someone who'd always have your back, always would be there for you and who'd love you just because and without limitations. Family outside of your ""inner circle family"" who you could always go to. He'd not judge you or close the door. He's one of those who's gonna keep checking in with the kids when they're teens and then adults themselves. 
Can't even imagine how much I'd have needed such a person growing up. 
A friend like Mark, an uncle like Mark, ... Mark's future partner and possibly children are going to be the most loved and treasured people, they'll be the luckiest. <3
These two are the most wholesome bestfriends I’ve ever seen 🥹😭
Mark Needs to do interviews or press releases or red carpet premieres or something film related because he is a GENUINE film/movie fan with a PASSION for storytelling and plot twists. 
Someone get this guy into this field. 
Also love his “la la loo, loo la la” car sing song 😊 I love him xxx
So cute how Nala was sat between you in the beginning, you can tell she loves you :) great video, thank you
Not me crying when Zoe showed Mark the photo book and was explaining the pics 😭❤️ love you guys ❤️
Mark and Zoe’s reaction to the fragrance at 13:45 is identical and hilarious 😂
Having a horrible night and can’t sleep - this is just what I needed as a pick me up, never fail to smile with these two 🫶🏻🫶🏻
Mark is so thoughtful, he knows that Nala loves him and he made t shirt of Nala. So lovely!
Hi Mark! I just wanted to come here and say thank you, just… THANK YOU!!❤️ I watched this video multiple times already since you put it up a few days ago and I'm just so happy to see you and Zoe together🥺💕✨ I've watched back so many of your old home center run and gift exchange videos this winter so far, but I can't get enough of it!! I love each and every one of them so so much❤ This year has been tough for me and these videos bring me pure happiness, truly🥹 ALSO, your T-shirt has my hometown name written on it and I HAD TO share that with you😍 I was born and raised there, and currently live in the city too☺️ Viva Osaka!!🙌🏻💖🤩 I know you've come to Japan before, but I hope you get to visit and travel around Osaka next time, in the future😘 Have a safe flight to the states as well🫶🏻!

#DemonSlayer #KimetsunoYaiba #Anime",2736,"this arc will be the calm before the storm
This arc is pretty cool, but manga readers all know how legendary the next will be
Edit: I think there will be one more arc after the next, or maybe just one big arc smushed together after this one
This is it guys, where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc, get yourself ready for what's coming next
This season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all 🔥
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc 😭 It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Hell yeah! Manga readers all know what's going to come next! The calm before the storm!!! 😤🔥🔥🔥
I can definitely see a lot of people not going like this arc due to the fact that it doesn't really have any great fighting sequence. But I don't care, The fact that this arc is the prime setup of one the greatest arcs in the entire series sends me shivers. Truly one of the ""calm before the storm"" moments.

And for any manga readers reading this, you know damn well that they are going to give us one of the biggest cliffhangers in the series, if you know what I mean.
Demon Slayer is absolutely a phenomenon to experience! It's been almost 5 years since the anime debuted and now after the the Hashira Training arc, we'll be officially 1 arc away (depending on how they animate the final one) from completing the anime. I remember watching the first episode only a few days after its release like it was just yesterday... I never imagined it would become this big!! I can't wait to experience all of what kny has before it ends ❤‍🔥
Happy to see all the Hashira in one frame. *2025 to Infinity Arc*
its crazy how big and popular Demon Slayer got in such a short amount of time!!
hyped for the new season!!
For manga readers out there, what im most excited for is when mitsuri is gonna explain how she got the mark. I LOVE THAT SCENE and cant wait to see the other hashiras backstory animated
A final happiness for us ds fans coz people are not ready for the next infinity castle arc its really gonna break the internet 🤧❤️🔥
I absolutely can not wait to see the arc after this get animated. It will be a legendary arc, and I get chills thinking about it.
This arc is gonna be awesome and can't wait next year
Tengen is sooooo beautiful here ❤❤❤❤❤ 
This arc in manga was pretty cool ! It will be the same in anime with a such good animation ! Thank u Ufotable ❤
My God, this masterpiece that I've been waiting for has finally come out, I don't know if the trailer is official for another hour? This is a dream.
This trailer gave me chills I am excited to know that the season will do.
It’s awkward to see there’s only 8 hashira’s right now.. And soon to be one 😭😭
BUT HEY!! THIS!? THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!🤗🤗
I’m so excited for the Hashira training arc  It really is the definition of calm before the storm.
Once this arc is over, now the real fun starts with some of the most epic fights/best story developments you've seen! (So excited for this to come along with the rest)",1,Film & Animation,703000,PT4M8S
GB,QEt36u4KJuk,Chris Harris on The 1990 Williams-Renault FW13B Formula One Car - Hungarian Grand Prix Winner,Collecting Cars,2023-12-10T14:00:10Z,,93629,3712,"This is one for all you F1 fans out there! As an introduction for its arrival on Private Sales by Collecting Cars, Chris Harris dives into the archives with former Head of Williams Heritage, Jonathan Williams, to discuss the history of the grand prix winning 1990 Williams-Renault FW13B Formula 1 car. 

This car is now available on Private Sales by Collecting Cars: https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/1990-williams-renault-fw13b

With a striking design that any aesthete can appreciate, the FW13/13B model is a particularly notable racer from Williams’ history, claiming three Grand Prix wins across the 1989 and 1990 seasons. That achievement is all the more impressive considering the dominance of Senna and Prost over those two years; between them winning 21 of the 32 races.

Chassis FW13B-08 is arguably the most impressive of all, securing not only pole position in qualifying, but taking its driver to outright victory at the Hungaroring in 1990, leading from start to finish.

Finding a car that has spent 25 years in its team’s private collection is unusual, but another factor that makes this chassis especially rare is that it retains the original Renault RS2 3.5-litre V10. Most of these powertrains were scrapped in period, so it is remarkable to find a car still running its correct and fully functional ‘works’ engine.

#chrisharris #Williams #Formula1 #F1 #Renault #Racecar #collectingcars #thierryboutsen",214,"This is the sort of content the cosmos wants you to produce rather than the Top Gear centrist stuff.  Thank you.  I hope you enjoy doing what you were destined for - I absolutely love it.
Collecting Cars is allowing Chris to grow and develop.
The amount of knowledge Mr. Jonathan Williams has is mind-blowing.
Some people still don’t realise just how good Nigel Mansell was. One of the best F1 drivers ever.
Chris Harris on: Race car History. ❤️
What a treat it would be to have a series of hour long programs with Jonathan Williams talking about each FW car from the 90’s.
Please do more racing stories like this. We need more historical looks into racing than the oversubscribed world of super cars we’ll never have. Great work.
The thing about that Mansell story that went untold - the first time Nigel got in the car and went around the track, he immediately came into the pits and said ""go to the truck and get me the softest springs you've got"". After they were fitted, Nige went two seconds quicker than the car had ever gone around that circuit. That's why Patrick felt they'd wasted 1990 - they'd (at Boutsen's behest) gone completely in the wrong direction in terms of car setup.
This era of F1 was sadly before my time, but thank you for this conversation as I learnt so much!
Fantastic content and production (and where has Jonathan Williams been hiding?  - love to hear more from him)
Brilliant, just bloody brilliant! Great car with that amazing documented history. Chris, can we please have an extended interview with Jonathon Williams.
That was THE Pinnacle of the sport. 3.5 V10 manual. The sound and visual drama. Driver skills were paramount! Very unlike contemporary equipment which has more resemblance to playstation than exciting racing. Pitcrew in shorts and no helmets is just a sight to behold 👍👏
I think I could listen to Jonathan Williams and Chris Harris talk about Formula 1 for a week and still not be bored. Stellar work!
The best era in F1 in my opinion, late 1980's to mid/late 1990's.  That howling exotic sound and titanium sparks flying out the back.  I can't even care about the modern Formula 1 since they went V6 turbo 😢
What a machine!! I was 13 when this car was winning races, remember watching those races with my dear old dad, thanks for bringing back those memories, miss you Dad, peace
Highly emotional. Having been the avid F1 follower on TV in those days, this somehow feels like a part of my own history.
Thanks to all involved in this production.
I feel this video was made specifically for me. It’s 100% right up my alley. The subject matter, the time period and the content. Perfection.
Wow, that didn’t feel like 17 minutes. I legitimately got goose bumps when the book was shown with the run sheets. Incredible stuff. Please Chris, more of this!
That was one of the best videos/interviews I’ve seen for a while. What a knowledge and memory Jonathan has. 👏🏼👏🏼
What something like this gives the viewer is a true, heart of your soul talk. Jonathan Williams' knowledge, his calm precise manner is wonderful. And Chris, his memories, pleasure and admiration of the people and the cars is so good to watch. First Class",2,Autos & Vehicles,238000,PT17M14S

For me, your videos are not vlogs, but more like coming over to a friend's house to share in life. A cup of tea, a good walk, and wonderful, meaningful conversation. I always feel so grateful and calm, so grounded after. Thank you so much for the depth of your sharing.
I've been a chef most of my life and a baker for about half my career...I have never enjoyed watching someone bake as much as I've enjoyed watching you now. It brings me back to times and reasons why we spend time in the kitchen especially during the holidays...it's the joy and fun of just making something wonderful.  Thank you for reminding me about the spirit of the holidays and bringing me back to my childhood of baking things with my mom!! Much love and God bless!! As always!!
Jonna, dont ever feel like you HAVE to do big things on this channel for us, we are all here to just have a relaxing cozy time with you. Whatever you put out comes out beautiful no matter what you do. 
Decorating home and just doing ''small'' stuff like that is so cozy and authentic.
Do not put insane expectations on yourself for us, we are here for YOU and your day to day life. <3
Merry christmas and a happy new year to you and your family!
This was 100% the Christmas video we all needed!
The idea to hang the jewelry out in the trees to soak up the energy of the forest is so wonderful Jonna. ❤️
What a special Christmas tree!!! Full of jewellery instead of baubles and not cut down but left in its full splendour in the garden... I LOVE it!
Dear Jonna, dear Johan, dear family in the north of Sweden,

over the past years you have created a variety of videos which have touched me on a deeper level. This video is yet another one bringing me in touch with my emotions. I can't put into words how grateful I am for your channel and from a higher perspective also for the way of living you have chosen. Your video felt like a warm hug for me. It was exactly what I needed. My beloved father died on November 19th, 2023 and it hasn't been easy to create a new life for us with this loss. I know he is still with us in spirit. 
Thank you so much, dear Jonna and Johan, for creating such a cosy atmosphere and embracing Christmas season. 
I am sending you love as well, for you and all your loved ones.
I  so grateful to the girl that bagged my groceries a few years back and told me about this channel. Ever since I get these rare moments of enchantment. 
If ever there was a place that lends itself to the beauty of Christmas decorating it is this far away , mystical woods where we find Jonna and her loving husband.
Each time she uploads And unlike any other channel I watch I get rid of any other distractions and my seriously chaotic brain settles in for what is sure to be a lovely respite from my world!  
I thank you Jonna for doing everything so beautifully for us ESPECIALLY when you are both under the weather!
I love how comfortable Johan is on camera now. I love to see the two of you interact and all the love that is shared between the two of you.🙏🏻🤗🎄
As someone who lives in Greece, the coldest weather I have been to is 0 C degrees. And that feels so cold!! I can't imagine how -21 is like!! Thank you for everything Jonna, your energy, for capturing the beauty of nature and sharing it with us, for the happiness and coziness you bring to our home!!! For the joy you bring to me and my sister!! We always enjoy your videos together and every time we dream of experiencing snow, northern lights, beautiful skies and all the Nordic beauty!! Really, thank you so much!!! Merry Christmas to you and your family!!♥ :))
Sending well wishes. How sweet to hear your husband express gratitude for your effort in cleaning. Its the little things.
Dear Jonna, most of all I like you for NOT trying to be perfect, but just for being yourself! This is what makes your place not just another social media channel, but a cosy place where everyone is welcomed as a dear friend. Greetings from Saint Petersburg, it's also cold and snowy here! Anna.
This is the most sweet and cute Christmas preparing video I ever saw - so perfect in it's imperfectness, so full of love and humanity, deep cosy emotions and humour - wow, I 'm really moved of your kind personality and personality and how you both harmonize together. Thank you for letting us in, although you were sick (I am not able be so busy when I am healthy 😅🙈) and from my heart I wish you a wonderful Christmastime! And YESSSS - I will embrace it, too 😊🎄❤️
This might be a new favourite way you do videos ❤ Don't get me wrong I love your adventure videos up into the mountains or the city, but the slow life ... that's something we all need desperately! And I feel you, was sick and had a week off never been more creative drawing from early to late because nothing was acquired of me 😄😊
Tack fina ni för att ni bjuder in oss i erat liv 😍🌟
“It’s new times now; we want the wrinkles!” 😂 Johan is such a supportive partner. 💯 Merry Christmas all!!
I was just reading some of the comments. It really feels such a privilege to be part of your community, Jonna  and Johan! Please don't stress, we all love you and love your vlogs, the long ones and the shorter ones. Have a wonderful Christmas Jonna, Johan and the whole community!❤",22,People & Blogs,5040000,PT39M20S

Joolz gives his friend Simon the tour while Simon films. Simon is filling the role of the tourist in our place. We viewers feel like we are personally on the tour. Thank you Joolz and Simon for the enjoyment I’ve received from these videos. It’s much easier than traveling all the way to London. 😊
these areas of London are absolutely fascinating and it is wonderful that these shops go back so many years and can show you Ian Fleming and Winston Churchill's fragrances!   beautiful buildings from a beautiful era.
Last summer I visited and spent the afternoon inside the fascinating London Library! It happened by chance and I wasn’t aware that Bram Stoker had visited the same library! Wow! After wasting most of my morning inside the Cyprus consulate, which is also in St. James Square, I was drawn to the library once I spotted it and I felt compelled to pop inside to have a look! I was very pleased that I had because The London Library is indeed a very fascinating place! 😊
Superb episode - loved Floris, Hatchards and Sotherans and the time map! Great stuff yet again.
Not enough words to describe how good this episode is.
Astounding yet again Joolz. Particularly fond of your dedicated to fragrance shops video idea. Now, if you can also add a dedicated to unusual/niche/secret bookshops & libraries video, I would be most grateful. Especially if you can locate a copy of the original Necronomicon  😈😺

As always - brilliant episode.
The assistants at all those shops were marvellous - friendly, warm, knowledgeable and welcoming. Great advertisements for their businesses!
(Also great reference to The Pogues - RIP Shane)
🎄❄️☃️When I visited Picadilly Circus & The Strand, I was overwhelmed by the inmense history and rich culture that this part of London contained. Excellent as always Jooz Guides 🎩
I spent most of 1975 working in the staff canteen of the Piccadilly Hotel, two floors beneath street level! This 21 year old Canadian saw both sides of London (Shades of Orwell’s ‘Down and Out in…’). I roamed every street you showed, loved every minute spent there. Thank you for reviving grest memories!
What a great tour! So many wonderful historic shops. Thank you!
I appreciate, and have a lot of respect for you, with the way that you not only will show and talk about businesses in the areas you are touring, but also will go inside and give the owners/employees a chance to tell us about the place in their own words, give some history about it, and promote the local businesses to make the people watching your videos interested in going there and supporting them. Even though it's also a way for you to get more information and content in your video to make it longer, add some interest, and have more accurate descriptions of the places and what they do, it really is a Class Act for you to do that simple gesture especially when they aren't paying you to come there and include them in your videos!
It's also kind of funny that the two girls  were taking a picture of themselves under the ""underground"" sign while touring the city and they were mere feet away from the greatest tour guide they could hope for to show them around, give them the history of the city, tell them not only facts about it but also some things that may or may not be facts but should be! lol!
Thank you for sending me your signed book with devotion so rapidly, dear Julian! I was lucky to have noticed your announcement about the signing event in November and made use of it😊. It was delivered very quickly to Germany. I have already my favourite routes in your book and will be happy to walk them through when I will be next time in London😊. I also rewatched the episode with the favourite places of your mum and was delighted by her fine taste: I noticed that it would be an ideal day for me, if I spent it just like in that episode! Every site was a pearl - and ended in Victoria&Albert Museum🎉. Magnificent. And may this educated and kind hearted woman rest in peace.
Absolutely scintillating. My favorite area of london, and my favorite joolz guide so far. Stacked with information too. Bravo! 🎉🏆
A cup of Earl Grey and a tour of Piccadilly with Joolz. The perfect way to end Sunday. Thank you so much!!!
This was a great walk and so interesting.  Too bad Tower Records closed but if I’m not mistaken they still have a store in Japan.  There are plenty of record stores in London; maybe you could do a tour of those🤔Your channel is great for those of us that don’t get to travel. Thanks Joolz and Simon!
I do love these videos! A stressful period yet I’m sitting here watching with interest and then realise that I’m smiling away! Oh, and the book is ‘brill. 👍
Another great film, always good to hear Tom singing too 🙂Spotted the Cyprus flag - my adopted home country. Piccadilly just isn't the same any more, just glad there are still many old parts of London with lots of history for you to tell us about. Plenty to fill many books I am sure   😉

Summary by TammyAI
Joolz, you never fail to amaze by by finding some gem or other. Even in somewhere like Piccadilly - which, although from Australia, even we have walked half a dozen times - you uncover Ian Fleming's scent No 89, Blades/Reform Club from ""Die Another Day"", and a first edition ""Casino Royale"" for a mere £30,000 at Sotherans Rare Books and Prints. I'll be in 00heaven. Plus, I'll have to go rummaging though Hatchards trying to beat Bill Nighy and Tilda Swinton to a signed copy of your book, secretly secreted in the stacks! Merry Christmas to you!",19,Travel & Events,280000,PT34M39S

Now he knows what it’s like to play the Chiefs 😂😂😂
The call was 100% correct. Chiefs have no one to blame but themselves
For those who didn't watch SNF tonight...

This penalty was called once in 2021, twice last year and 11 times coming into the game this season. 

So it was obviously a point of emphasis for officials. And the flag was thrown immediately upon the snap so it wasn't some conspiracy. 

Mahomes' reaction is really rubbing me wrong and comes off spoiled.
There has been a lot of bad officiating this season. 

This was an example of good officiating.
Hes looking at the baaaaaaaall , and still line up off side....WoW!
Chiefs are arguing that such a ticky tack call shouldn´t happen at such an important point of the game.  We should go back and see what the Eagles think about the holding call in the Super Bowl last year... Chiefs weren´t complaining then...
Never understood why ANY player, whatever the position, would line up offside.  These guys have been playing this game their whole lives and are the best at what they do.  You don't even have to move your bod, just use a couple of neck muscles, turn your head and LOOK.  Unbelievable.
Because the Chiefs have gotten so many favorable calls over the years, Mahomes wanted all the spotlight to go on him. The bills won this game and they don’t even get to be applauded for it because the only thing that people are going to be remembering from this game is this play where the penalty was rightly called. Mahomes does not need to get mad at the refs, he needs to get mad at his receiver for lining up offsides.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral 🙌
Still one of the best plays seen this year to bad toney didnt look where he was standing
If you're lined up as a receiver and you have to look back over your shoulder (around the defensive lineman standing next to you) to see the ball.  You're offsides.  How did Toney not realize the ball and center was behind him?
Doesn't matter how many times it was called before. You know the rules, offsides is offsides, end of story. He could have just as easily went to the line and moved his foot back a few inches, he knew the game was at stake, and if he didn't know he was offsides then the person next to him should have known.
He was looking right at the ball. How could he not know to move back? That's on him.
What's shocking is that Toney didn't drop the lateral from Kelce.
All penalties aside, that was a sweet lateral
Ive always wondered why back laterals werent used more they are used effectively in flag football i know theres no contact so its a bit easier but if done correctly there is alot of open plays for tds like this one
As a Broncos fan it puts joy in my heart seeing him like this
It does look like offsides but what a cool play. The Chiefs are an amazing team.
Geez that was a great throw, a great catch and an amazing pass ending with an exciting TD…. Would have been fun in highlight reels, Kelce probably can’t reenact that last-second pass, what a shame!!",17,Sports,268000,PT1M5S

Kier keeps playing with fire at this point dev might make another torture manhunt
The amount of dedication they put in this is more I could put in anything
Why does Dev always get the most infuriating challenges...? 😂😂😂😂
You know it’s gonna be a good day when kier and dev upload
Dev started as a hunter, and when he got detached, he still decided to be speed runner XD
I would love to try some of these challenges myself. They seem fun. But my computer can barely handle running Minecraft with graphics at the lowest setting, never mind multiplayer high paced PVP related stuff. Also, I can’t speedrun, so it would be several hours to complete a challenge like this.
I love how intense this video was, and then the end was the most anti-climactic thing ever
“it was supposed to be fun.. like friends work together.” actually kinda hit me in the feels. feels bad man
Kier is channeling the ultimate little sibling energy
this actually isn't a bad twist, imagine boosfer being stuck with ondreas against you and kier but you and kier cant damage each other and can punch each other to fly
You know, I'd love to see a Manhunt with all the speedrun strats not wortking. I.e. Trading doesn't give pearls. Enderman only spawn in the overworld. Water+Lava source gives cobble. And have Dev be the speedrunner. Maybe then he'd be Kier's speed <3
this channel will never fail to make me question my life decisions. in a good way, of course
I'm so glad boosfer finally agreed to do a manhunt
This is my favorite color crew video in awhile. It was very funny and a completely different unique idea compared to most manhunt twists currently. Also having Boosfer in a manhunt must have taken a lot of bribe money.",20,Gaming,1100000,PT21M40S

#DougDoug #skyrim #mod",15153,"We all know the reason chat makes Doug’s heart rate increase is because Doug loves us
Doug's heart rate being 20bpm lower than mine shows that a well oiled heart is important
Chat:”Doug do a small dance” *Doug proceeds to dance violently knocking down his green screen*
There is never a moment where you feel disconnected from Doug, his viewer interaction is Completely Unmatched
The way chat just said “let him cook” well they were playing rock, paper, scissors was hilarious
I'm amazed he kept his heart rate down when CHEESEWHEEL GAMING was on screen. What a trooper.
Don’t you just love Doug’s CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments? Fucking incredible
I sure do love it when Dough pours his CHEESEWHEEL GAMING all over his viewers
The voice for the spawning bot is perfect
I love the part where Doug said CHEESEWHEEL GAMING and he cheesewheeled all over us
My favorite part of the video is when Doug said “ITS CHEESEWHEEL GAMING TIME”, and CHEESEWHEEL GAMINGing on all the bad guys
I love how much effort Doug puts into his
CHEESEWHEEL GAMING videos
The harmonious ending supporting Doug's venture was truly CHEESEWHEEL GAMING so inspirational
as always doug never fails to deliver content to us. big CHEESEWHEEL GAMING content there
I love that Chat decided to play along and spawn an army in that rush to Dragon's Bridge!
I was at the edge of my seat when that CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moment happened. Good thing Doug stayed so calm!
Love how Doug's CHEESEWHEEL GAMING moments are always amazing to watch even while having so much cheese.
It was a real experience to watch this live. The tragedy of so many lives lost to trucks will never be forgotten, and we will always have CHEESEWHEEL GAMING to remember them by.

@HopeScope on TIKTOK for some laughs",3064,"Does this mean we're getting an ""I Bought Every American Girl Doll"" video? Because I would definitely watch that.
I find it strange that the monster cereals were apparently discontinued because I still see them every year.
We loved having you and your team out to the Electric Starship Arcade. Thank you for hanging out with us Hope!
As an American Girl Doll collector, you did AMAZING at pointing out the differences between the eras of dolls. I’m so happy to see so many people finding their love for these dolls again!
As a professional baker, i’ve made a barbie cake like that before. A few tips for the next time, wrap the lower half of your doll in plastic wrap before you stick her in, less mess that way, also stick her in before you decorate the cake that way the bodice of the dress matches the skirt 😊
Love how you called the newer Polly Pocket's clothes 'chewy'. 😂
I could feel the serotonin flowing while you played the Mary-Kate and Ashley mall game. I would definitely watch a live of you playing it to relive my childhood!!
Hey Hope! That Polly was original but the castle is actually a Star Castle! I had that exact one. Equally as cute and nostalgic but definitely it's own vibe ✨️
As a kid, I had a chore chart with a picture of that 2000s Samantha doll taped to it as a reminder of what I was working toward. After months and months of getting a few bucks a week for doing jobs around the house, she was finally mine! 😊
the monster cereals were fully stocked at my Target for Halloween this year. They bring them back every year for the holiday, so I was surprised to see them in here lol
I had the tiny Polly Pockets and Rollerblading Kira!! She was so hip and the little fanny pack was everything. The essence of 1991. I had no idea they were discontinued, but they basically work just like a lighter lol 😂
I wanted a Samantha doll more than anything as a kid. Her books were the reason I started to love to read ❤️
I love seeing how far Hope has come I remember watching y’all her videos in order and I would get sooo excited when I got a notification saying she posted and I still get as excited.I wish you good luck on reaching 4M.
I was 30 in 2004, but the Mary Kate & Ashley game still got me. The graphics were crazy, lol. I remember my children wanting some of these items, lol. Thanks, Hope!😊
hope is amazing she puts in so much time work and money into these videos i am just so grateful for her
Actually loving all the background changes in this video ❤ it made it much more animated and fun!
I legit had that rollerblade Barbie!! She was my favorite! I also think AG dolls were better overall quality when Pleasant company was still in control. The most noticeable details were in the dolls clothing. Everything was so true to life with little clasps and now it’s all cheap Velcro but for the same price .. also the dolls were made in Germany back then .. not China.
I wish there was hours of this content it is scrumptious & I love seeing childhood products I never got to have. if you ever want to make this videos longer wed watch queen
For the polly pockets they brought back the 2000s ones, you can find them at target. It made me so happy to see 😊
My daughter actually loves Polly Pockets! They make them in different varieties now. There are ones with the “chewy” clothes lol. Another with the hinge bodies, and others with plastic/silicone forms called Micro Polly- that’s the small compact versions. ❤️❤️",26,Howto & Style,3920000,PT19M42S

Thanks for having me along for the day man, was a lot of fun!
Hope you’ve got some snacks ready - this is the longest video we’ve EVER made 😂 Which country’s tech do you want us to test next?
Looks like you guys had an amazing tech shopping spree in Japan! Next time round, how about scoping out some everyday gizmos. Would love to see how Japan's home-tech game stacks up against ours.
your one of my favorite YouTubers Arun. you always have a fresh happy smile on your face
Fun Fact, there was actually another company in Japan called ""Logitec"" (it's spelled the same as Logitech in Japanese), and they were in Japan before Logitech was able to open up anything in Japan, so they had to change their name to Logicool in Japan only to avoid a name conflict.
This is so surreal. I've been letting the Abroad in Japan channel build up videos to binge, and after the Frozen Frontier series, I went back to another video from Arun to finish it, and I was like ""Oh yeah! There's a new video, I wanna watch that!"" And now seeing Chris walk in was like...

The only way I can express the feeling was imagine you watch a TV show, and then switch to another TV show, only to see the character from the other TV show nonchalantly walk in. Like, what?
That trackball mouse is something I used at my job back in the late 80s, early 90s. You’ve never seen one before?! 
This was a great collab!  Love to watch both yours and Chris’s channels. 
That store completely blows my mind. I could be in there for days…
Love the longer video, btw. This was enjoyable to watch.
I might be one of the few Japanese subscribers of your channel. Your videos are awesome and I genuinely hope more people here can enjoy them (maybe difficult because of the language barrier tho). Hope you’ll come back soon🇯🇵🙌
I think I can go an entire day exploring this shop without rest or food, genuinely amazing.
the timing of those memes is just *chef's kiss*
I love how excited Arun gets about this stuff that has been available all over the world for years now lol.
The ball mouse is called a trackball, pretty useful especially helping reduce RSI. its been available for years in the west but we hardly made a fuss about it. Also for fine control, you can use a hotkey on your keyboard to move super slow to be accurate.
39:20 first time in Japan (over twenty years ago) taught me that rice is not a ""bulk up"" / ""filler""  meal item but  something to be enjoyed as much as any other item on the plate, even in something as texturally and flavour diverse as a shojin ryori meal the rice is as much a part of the experience and been mildly evangelical about spreading that opinion - it's a hard sell to a lot of Westerners   
but  it's my occasional, once or twice a year, life mission.
I’m a Japanese in the UK and I really enjoyed this.  Shame the kids watch won’t work in the UK. With child safety more of an issue here than in Japan it would probably do relatively well here.  I love rice cookers and bought all my friends one over a couple of years.  Yum Asia do good ones in the UK and not as expensive as the Japanese leader but similar technology. I didn’t see it in the video, and I know it’s not a cooking channel… but I hope you washed the rice first…. 😅
It’s my dream to go to Japan, definitely visiting this tech place when I eventually go 🥰
Touch Ball Mice are used a lot in North America (Canada more then USA) they are used a lot for work in fields that use programs such as AutoCAD Maya, Blender and image creation such as Krita, Photoshop etc. They work very well for a lot of things even gaming. I loved mine but the ball has a small accident, exactly like the one you had when you picked it up, My sister and I nicked named the ball  ""BOOOTS"" its a joke from Baldur's Gate 2 with the Gigantic Minatare Space Hamster and when it would fall out of the rest of the mouse it was one of those moments of almost yelling ""NO BOOTS!"" as if fell and if it hits something hard or even a pointy pebble and gets a scratch on its all over, its done and now you are sad. I would buy another one should they drop in price as they became more rare in stores and the reason that is important is unlike a mouse that you can usually find a way to hold relatively weird mice, with ball mice you need to make sure it fits your hand in a very comfortable way while you control the ball with your thumb so it makes sure you can do that for extended amount of time so if it does not fit your hand right you will hate it with a passion, when it fits right, you wonder why you have not been using this type of mouse for your whole life. So you need to make sure its the right fit for you and make sure you never drop the ball as that is how ""BOOTS"" died one little scratch and the dream was dead but got i believe 4 years out of her before that unfortunate accident. After that time no stores were carrying them except one and it was a crap one and a very shitty size and quality. 
Final thing there are some that use 2-4 optical sensors that make it be able to do much more control in a 3D environment such as 123D, AutoCAD and others, but it also makes games such as MMORPGs, FPS and RTS a joy to play and target with insane accuracy for headshots, especially the multiple sensor ones.

So find the right one that fits your hand and has the amount of sensors you want with the DPI you want and never look back, that said you should still have a normal mouse as sometimes if your hand is tired or your thumb is soar or something like that, a normal mouse can be a little easier to use for those moments.
I love coverage like this. I'd love it even more if you got a little input from the target audience of each device. For example the portable record players were old tech in the late 80s (a portable record player was one of my first repairs). I'd be surprised if those devices have had any innovation since then. I suspect that the target audience for those is not tech enthusiasts, or vinyl enthusiasts, but instead retirees, whose entire music collection is in vinyl, and are just happy to still be able to play what they have.

I felt this way about a few of the items in this video, and some recent videos. I think it's especially important to get input when visiting other cultures and passing judgement on their choices.

Other than that, you've done an amazing job, as always. And I can't wait to see the next one.
Thank you so much for giving us so much quality content and being so interesting❤ you look like you had a fun time🎉
This is a dream collab! For a long time I watched you guys' channels and appreciated you in every video, but seeing you conquer the biggest electronic store together is such a nice surprise. Japan lifestyle carries both futuristic prospects and the relics of the past, so any kind of video from there is bound to be the most interesting tech and lifestyle content.
Arun consistently amazes me with the incredible dedication and effort he puts into his videos. His passion for technology shines through in every frame, and it's truly commendable. The buying and reviewing tech series is, without a doubt, the best out there – his thorough insights, engaging delivery, and genuine excitement for the latest gadgets make each video an absolute delight to watch. Keep up the fantastic work, Arun, your hard work does not go unnoticed, and your content continues to be a beacon for tech enthusiasts like myself!",28,Science & Technology,17300000,PT40M10S

Thank you Santa Monica
The fact they put many hours into this dlc to make it free for us is too nice thanks Santa Monica
This is why Santa Monica Studios is such a gem within the gaming industry.

Not only do they release such an exciting DLC, they do it for free, knowing how much their fanbase will appreciate this
The game mechanics in GOW Ragnarök are insanely well made! Can not wait to play this free DLC. Thank you Santa Monica Studios!
Love a studio that loves its fans. I’ve gotten so much pleasure playing their games over decades of time. To know they recognize that and want to give this to us for free solely for our enjoyment is just icing on the cake.
This is why Santa Monica Studios is the best, not a lot of companies do this kind of stuff for their fans. Thank you Santa Monica Studios for blessing us with this dlc🙌
I've been counting the days until the new GoW DLC drops, and every sneak peek just amplifies the hype! 🙌 Kudos to the Santa Monica Studio team for pouring their heart and soul into this—feels like we're not just playing a game, but living through an epic saga. Who else is ready for this immersive adventure?
Thank you, Santa Monica Studios, for making this, releasing it on PS4 as well, and giving it away for free. I can't wait to dive back into this incredible game.
So excited to play this, Ragnarok was an amazing experience that gave me the feeling I had growing up playing games that you could just tell had a ton of love and passion put into them.
We love this Santa Monica! Can’t express our gratitude enough that you put in the work after game release to add additional content for FREE! Thank you all very much for your hard work 🎉 I hope other game companies see this as an example of what dlc SHOULD be
Thank you Santa Monica!

you guys are legends and the work you've done on GoW is astounding and amazing.

thank you so much and happy holidays to all of you!
You are truly the best! Thank you for the free DLC dear Santa Monica Studio. This is not at all self-evident. We as fans really appreciate that. Please keep up the fantastic work! I hope that we can experience some more new adventures with Kratos.
Greatly thankful for the work put in and for free dlc.. The fact that you went and developed this dlc without any fans asking for it, (in this day and age where others AAA studios do bare minimum and get way with it) speaks volumes and greatness about Santa Monica.. 👏🙏
Thank you, Santa Monica! Thank you for an incredible and outstanding game, and thank you for this additional content. Excited to see what is next from the studio when you’re ready to show it off!
The fact they made this free AND quality shows what an excellent studio Santa Monica is! Hats off to them. Thank you for another masterful experience!
Solo diré gracias, son unos genios y que gran aporte a la comunidad.
I love the fact they encorporated the Greek era music in this and I hope it's in the game and not just in the trailer
This is gonna be so fun not gonna lie. I hope we get to see at least one glimpse of Atreus at the end with him somewhere else, or get a little mention of him. Im so excited for it
this looks incredible. cant wait to play it. i hope some day they remake the original trilogy in the same style as this.
Such a cool thing to do, and a great way to show appreciation to your fan base!

ryan joining that group of kids and excitedly running up the stairs and riding in the tubes with them is the most wholesome thing i have seen today omg. im sure they were so happy that he joined them, soooo adorable
Ryan risked losing his Apple Watch just to test a review. Mad respect
The fact that Ryan is able to talk to a camera in public without getting embarassed is insane.
I was cracking up from start to finish. Thanks man, I needed that 😂
I always worry about content creators' ettiquette when they're recording in public. It fills me with confidence to see you being genuinely polite and cordial to the service workers :)
I went on the Harry Potter ride many times, but this one time I did actually get stuck for a few minutes. The people were very nice about it and even let me skip the line so I could go on again without waiting. I have to say it was worth it 👍
Watching Ryan and his dad have fun at the place they've talked about going together for so long is really heart-warming <3
As someone who's been to Universal Studios once and loved every second of it, I was shocked to learn it had such a low review score. I guess the waiting just doesn't bother me that much, since I'm already used to Disneyland waiting time.
I don't know why but asking the kid if she knew Janelle made me laugh so hard. And then you saying she is upset and the kid going ""oh""... comedy gold.
*Ryan is the most humble heartwarming person to ever exist! 🎉*
I love his videos cuz he is being himself and still makes me laugh. 😂
Universal Studios is very popular so there is a reason why it’s so packed and that the lines are so long. There really isn’t anything the workers can do to change that. The main thing that can change waiting in line is to get a fast pass depending on if you think the money is worth it to not wait in line. Some lines are kinda crazy. Of course there are a few rides in the Harry Potter world area that do sometimes jade technically difficulties. The ride getting stuck can most likely be fixed with some maintenance on the ride. Whenever I’ve gone and the rides got stuck the employees let everyone who was stuck get a free fast pass
Ryan Trahan definitely has infinite ideas to entertain fans and to never disappoints us with our content, he took this to an absolute infinity win.
I agree with Mark, we got stuck on the Harry Potter ride for 15 minutes in this weird cave section that always creeped me out. I was scared and didn't know anybody else on the same coaster. So, I just had to sit there with my head down while these ghost things were swirling around everywhere.
i watch your videos on regular days, but i find myself reaching for them on the days where i am especially upset and sad. i got bad news last night and your videos are making it better. thank you ryan
Ryan never fails to make me smile 😁
Ryan having fun with a bunch of 12-14 year olds is weird wholesome😭
I just love how ryan talks to people without being hesitated or nervous :)
Your dad is so amazing and y’all’s relationship is so wholesome. I wish I could have something like that with mine",24,Entertainment,14100000,PT21M13S

her vocals have improved so much better since Drivers Licence!
Her voice, her passion, her act , her melody, her story , her visual, everything about her is just perfect.
Imagine singing this live without backing tracks and just with your raw voice, this was absolutely hard!! Hats off to Olivia
her vocals, her high notes, literally everything about her is amazing.
her vocals is so amazing both live and in the studio
Olivia's vocals (live or studio) never fail to amaze me. This quiet but powerful version is amazing
This song is really hard to sing and I applaud her courage to sing this live❤
Was her singing perfect here? No. 
Did her singing move me? Yes
Her delivery, the lyrics, the piano, it moved me and I love her live versions of vampire.
I was so surprised to see she had no earpiece, she did so well!!!  What I really don´t understand though is people saying her ""vocals have improved so much"" like huh? She has always been this good live, maybe her confidence grew and her vocal techniques got better but she´s always been an incredible live performer.
Love this! Her talent has bloomed so dramatically in the past 10 years. Videos like this prove this to be true.
her voice is so perfect and angelic! love you Olivia XOXO can’t wait to see you in concert
her vocals really improved so much from the past years, great job mother liv!!!
Ik she has some voice cracks in this but the fact that she still sounds amazing live says something!! She sounds just like how she does in studio recordings. And nobody should hating on her for having voice cracks in her live performances, every singer has them sometimes, so don’t hate on our amazing Liv!! 💜
Olivia conveys so much emotion in every song. I love seeing artists perform with no gimmicks. Just a beautiful girl and her piano. Well done!
The amount of talent she has at 20!! I can't wait to see what she does in the upcoming years
What a trip. The comment section is totally astroturfed by bots. She was a little off key a few times and the sh-sh-sh style of vocals is unnecessary but it was a great performance. No auto tune is a good thing. Hearing mistakes makes it better because it’s genuine.
this performance feel so real, like her vocals expressions and just genuine felling in this performances is by far the best she's ever done
A voz dela é simplesmente incrível
Love this slow, intimate piano rendition of her song! A completely different take that felt more hurtful and somber. Just goes to show what a good actress she is",10,Music,201000,PT4M1S

Alan deserves an Oscar award
The Cowboy hat was clever. At first I thought it was just a random aesthetic choice until I realized it also was there to contextualize TSC's rotational position in 3D space, since otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell what direction his body was facing unless the surrounding objects and environment were not symmetrical in shape, which most of them were.
If you could turn this format into a video game, you'd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids physics.
Please never stop doing these. Biology, Chemistry, Logic, History, anything you think you can display the concepts of with your teams incredible animation. Thank you.
For a spiritual seeker physics student, this is emotional❤
As a physics student I can say that this is amazing! I see we’re going for an “interstellar” interpretation of singularities, which is cool to see as well.
Alan successfully escalated from classical mechanics to string theory
This was absolutely stunning to watch. I can’t wait to see what comes next!

Maybe an “Animation VS Chemistry”? 

Chemistry is so much more complex than most people realise, and the kinds of things you can do with it are nuts.
Genuinely a brilliant demonstration of these concepts. It's like a whole season of Bill Nye compressed to the size of a single episode. You would make an excellent teacher
One of the most relaxing videos I have ever seen. Proud to say I learned something from this, and glad to know I get to exist at the same time as this. All the work you've done is incredible and deserves all the praise ever given.
As a guy who loves physics, I absolutely love this, from classical mechanics to general relativity, then quantum mechanics. Alan and his team are do amazing job at this
Absolutely beautiful portrayal of such complex topics in a simplified and fun animation. I absolutely adore your passion and commitment to these amazing works, keep up it up! You and your team are absolutely amazing!
Woah this animation is super amazing and mind blown! Just like in Math, Physics has a lot of broad and interesting topics like velocity, acceleration, friction, gravity and many more. I honestly love how you visualize every details that some people don't know which is crazy. I remember learning Physics during my high school years until college. I know that it sounds really difficult to understand but I'm sure that this animation will help a lot of students motivates them to study more about physics. Thank you so much, Alan Becker and the whole team for making this animation. I hope that you guys continue to make more this with new learnings and creative visuals. 🤯👍
I'm loving these new new animations.  There is so much information packed into every frame and equation with a storyline at the same time.

Amazing job and I can't wait to see what's next!
As a Civil Engineering major (junior), this and ""Animation vs. Math"" have brought me to tears. BOTH of them beautifully encapsulate the entire reason why I'm still passionate about what I'm studying. Thank you <3
This is one of the most impressive things I've seen on YouTube in a while. Respect to the team behind it.
This is by far my favorite animation on this channel, it’s so complex yet so simple at the same time and it is executed so beautifully. You deserve a damn Oscar for this
Spectacular animation, as a physics student it clearly and intuitively presented many of the concepts that I've learned, and for the ones that I have yet to learn, it was described in such a way that even without the practice or instruction, the simplicity and action allows for a good understanding of what each variable is, and why it is being used in the manner that it is. One particular example would be your demonstration of gravity assist, for even without ever having been involved in an equation of the sort, the explanation through animation was able to clearly demonstrate why the input variables were there, and generate a broad stroke understanding of how the equation functions.
This video was a masterpiece from start to finish. It has wonderful animation, a mere loud story, the way you played with lighting and music was genius, and it shows the way physics work in a marvellous and fun way, both what we know and what we don’t. 10/10.",1,Film & Animation,25500000,PT16M8S

It's incredible how relevant LB has been since 2003 in the NBA.
The in-season was a great addition. Good work NBA
honestly we can all agree the in season tournament is a great addition with the court being all fancy and good looking. i really enjoyed it all. i just wish AD was just consistent as this.
NBA administration gave to the players another reason to play. Not only championship but also winning something else would be moral-booster. Great job 👏 ❤
If only AD play like this every game, he will, become mvp for sure!
In season tournament was a nice addition
Let’s go, Lakers! 💜💛 
This is the AD every Lakers fan wants to see. He bossed it tonight. And LeBron adding yet another trophy to his list. He ain’t stopping for anybody just yet. This in season tournament has been a really cool addition.. even if the courts haven’t looked most pleasing, but I hope it’s here to stay.
NBA thank you for adding this tournament because this just hypes the regular and play offs season of that year and makes us know that even the unexpected teams can win it
What a feel-good moment 😊
At least we had a chance to witness the Championship Pedigree of the Lakers. Feelz like 2020 all over again.
The Lakers are STRONG! Dayum!
Loved watching reeves come up, hope it sticks
Buen formato, daivis demostrando que es el hombre del saco y lebron que sigue siendo el rey de la nba
If AD can maintain this form every game  Lakers will be cruising the West
Congratulations to the LA Lakers. What AD did in this game was what I expected from Brook Lopez, the kind of pass LeBron was giving A.D   Wwas what I expected from Lillard & Middleton. They failed to use their size advantage like the Lakers did.
This tournament should be taken only by LeBron...this dude is the real winner in this generation
Well done Lakers 💛💜
Congrats Lakers... Great Job
Go Lakers! 🔥🏀",17,Sports,1090000,PT3M13S

The sounds effects are so satisfying!
There's something I've dreamed of seeing in blox since I started playing, collision between attacks. Being able to defend attacks with other attacks or barriers will be simply incredible, using the ice X to stop attacks for example. This would definitely change the blox combat style, as well as making it more complex and, in my opinion, interesting and undoubtedly more beautiful.
I personally think that mirage needs a rework where there is the normal view on the island and you can put the blue gear in the ancient clock at the temple of time that is accessible by talking to the mysterious force at the top of the main tree in the great tree island I think that we shopuld be able to teleport on top of the great tree with the portal fruit c ability labelled ""Tree Top"".
the Z move is a little underwhelming but can be an extender, X move is lookin like the best combo starter, fox fire is a good extender or damage dealer, F is good for dodging or dealing a lil extra damage, (Base)

(Mode)
riding is ultimate furry (half joking lol)
Z move looks alot better, fits the transformation
X move is honestly worse than non mode X, range is way to short and can only be used as an extender, but since you cant use melee or sword it would be hard to use
C move is practically the same, just more aoe and (probably) damage
F move is just a slightly better version of itself, not much to say
you can walk on water which is cool for non sharks

Opinion: Is leopard better? yes and no, leopard is more spammy than kitsune, but kitsune is a way cooler furry than leo, honestly until release and we see what can and cant be ken dodged and the damage i have to say leo is probably better for now

Bonus: Fox lamp
Z move looks like its good if you can aim or extend off it, 
X (tap) good extender with seemingly good damage
X(hold) imo worse than tap X but better for aoe

Is it better than the best sword aka Cdk? No, it has potential but cdk has more combo potential (and most likely more damage)

I wrote this for no reason since no ones gonna see it lol
TIMESTAMPS 😀(Please pin this as it helps many people)

Kitsune Fruit(Mythical)
Value higher than Leo(as showed on twitter)

Fox Lamp Weapon

Z move scorching azure 8:42
X move Infernal Firestorm 9:14
Both moves can be held for more damage
The devs worked so hard on this thank you so much for the dedication on this beautiful fruit you guys are evolving a lot
I wish the tails and eyes glowed when it transformed but it is very nice nonetheless. I do wonder if they will ever add vanity options for the accessories cuz some dont look too appealing but have good stats while some are vice versa so i think adding vanity option would be pretty nice
Most visually pleasing fruit imo. Hope for more much better updates to come. Been playing this quite a while and although I hate grind games, this one really piqued my curiosity and became one of the best games I've ever played.
Moves are very clean and the music fits well with the fruits attack animations. I am looking forward to using this fruit in the future!
This seems to be a good anti-teamer fruit. Flashy, incredibly fast and all over the place and can drag others. Plus I see amazing combo potential with Kitsune and Fox Lamp
there should be more fruits that can change color like dragon can with the rings and this seems like a really good candidate
I started playing Blox fruits a while back and Blox Fruits has really stepped up their game. They have recently come out with Update 20 and it has many cool new features such as new looking fruits and a new Max level- this new Max level gives old players that stopped playing because they got to max level another reason to play. They also definetly know what they are doing. They always release trailers and peaks so that players get excited and want to play more often. This update 20 came out somewhat around the time of One Piece Live Action which means that when players watch One Piece Live Action they might understand more about Blox Fruits and want to play. Well done Blox fruits :)
I think there should be an exchange of materials in an upcoming update soon. I hope you will take this into consideration in my opinion.
I love this fruit and all the mechanics, the moves and animations looks very polished and clean good job blox fruits developers. Can't wait for the Dragon And Control Rework!!

It would be nice to get a sneak peak of 1 of control and dragon's moves just to see if they are worth buying
0:55
*Let's just appreciate how much a lot of time Gamer Robot puts in these awesome videos to make our day, huge respect!* 😆 👍
When transforming like a fox, maybe the tail should be given an effect to make it better and cooler!😊
Maybe its better if u put some blue aura around the transformation but this showcase and the fruit is looking good keep up the good work!😄😄
I think they should add another skill fruit that is hard to run / skycamp with tbh
the other mythical needs to keep up with the kitsune fruit which means every mythic needs a buff and others rework",20,Gaming,2870000,PT11M26S

Brawl stars you should give the stars drops from the trophy path to those who have already taken the levels previously
por primera vez estoy muy emocionada por la actualización❤ pero en serio me siento mal por que ya no podré conseguir el brawl pass con gemas 😢😢 pero al menos se compensa un poco con la mejora que le pusieron a las recompensas gratis,
aún así gracias supercell❤❤
The star drop change for the trophy path makes a lot of sense but is super disappointing for people who did get way worse prices in the  past. The fact that we do not get a compensation is not understandable for me at all..
🎉\0/ ameeei demais ❤ quanta atualização ❤❤❤❤❤ ansiosa
Eu amei o visual brasileiro da Piper! Vlw Supercell! Inclusive acho melhor  o 5v5 do FUTEBRAWL
2:40 si se dieron cuenta aparece el acceso anticipado de kit y por eso aparece que se puede comprar con oro
Ojalá y agregen mas recompensas a en la cuestion del nivel de experiencia ya que es algo que esta olvidado en el juego desde siempre y estoy seguro que muchos ni saben de eso, solo se han enfocado en el camino de trofeos
When will the new warrior kit arrive?
Essa atualização tá incrível, só que eu não estou conseguindo a sequência de vitórias, ontem eu estava conseguindo mais hoje não
Hola supercell, tenía unas cuantas preguntas , les agradecería si pudieran aclarármelas , un saludo y gracias 
Para la gente que ya hayamos conseguido las 50000 copas no hay stardrops legendarios ? , la recompensa antigua era mucho peor a la de ahora ….
Y cuando tenéis pensado actualizar la supercell store ? Para poder comprar los pases desde ahí

Yes! http://turnbackmovie.com
Burgers and microwaves: Together again in our hearts. Or, more to the point, our arteries.
Previously a dark combination of damp, spongey bread and reheated mashed-up cow flesh, they've improved over the years (mostly by telling you to toast the bun). Now we've got some super-budget microwaveable snacks - burger, sausage and hot dog - to look at. So, er, let's do that.

#microwave #burger #ashens",922,"Nothing beats a classic Ashens food special ❤
Ah, Ashens once again showing his enlightened hotdog technique.
Wow, Ashens is really dedicated to travel all the way from Dan's place in [REDACTED] to Norwich and back just for some microwave burgers
I mean for 90p it's definitely a better option than rustlers which used to be cheapish and are now basically as much as a proper sandwich
Crazy how you could make both an advent video with Dan and this on the same day. Crazy.
6:27
You can see the bun slowly re-inflating itself as Ashens positively remarks on the taste.
I’ve had these before, the cheapest Feasters (yellow packaging) are disgusting but the more expensive ones (red packaging) are actually very nice.
For some reason ive been binge watching these videos and I literally cannot distinguish between a 9 year old video and a brand new one.
Thankfully Ashens aged better than most of the food in his videos 😂
You put the mustard on that hotdog perfectly.
As an ASDA employee i see feasters come through the tills quite often, i shall now forever think of Ashens everytime i see one.
Only Ashens could have me enthusiastic about looking at Feasters
Hotdogs marketed specifically as microwave hotdogs have always confused me. Bread rolls aren't expensive, and it's not like you can't do a normal hotdog in the microwave.
Oh microwaved hotdogs. One of the things I never thought I would miss from going to grandmas after school. She's still alive and I am a grown, hairy arsed man, man. Just no one told me I'd have to watch her slowly lose her memories and herself. I hope she goes quietly without pain.
Feasters is just the brand name Asda uses instead of rustlers for its microwave burgers. They're exactly the same
Feasters will use Ashens quotes in their promotional materials for the sausage bap, like ""you can tell there's something in there"" and ""it's not super-unpleasant"".
For me, the Aldi version of these is my fave, price measured against taste. They’re a godsend as a midnight snack after, erm, y’know, a few wobbly imbibements. Saved me a fortune on impulsive dirty takeaways.
From my long experience working at call centres, the number 1 use case for this sort of thing is for when you've got a 30 minute lunch break and Tesco ready meals want a full 8 of those minutes in the microwave plus cooling time
It doesn't LOOK terrible. Too be honest, these kinds of burgers and sandwiches are kind of a guilty pleasure of mine. I've made many an acceptably agreeable breakfast out of the odd microwave burger.
Stuart is eating food that hasn't expired, I'm impressed
When I was in the UK living for a while, I was that poor with my wife that we ate nothing but home made pancakes made with water flour and sugar for 5 months, every meal. These would have been perfect",24,Entertainment,1610000,PT13M21S

GB,_SI8bPuHx54,Becoming The UK's BEST Fisherman In 6 Months,Fish With Carl,2023-12-09T11:45:03Z,,132119,4369,"Tournament or match fishing is exciting and lucrative, if you're any good at it... In this video I'm fishing my way toward a £30,000 prize! 
Check out my vlogs! @more_fishwithcarl 
Learn more about fishing on my @fishingtutorials channel!
Follow me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/fishwithcarl
For my books, clothing and more: https://fishwithcarl.co.uk

My fishing videos are supported by Korda and Guru Tackle, so big thanks to them!",442,"Carl , in my honest opinion, your videos have become as good as if not better than most TV shows. The quality is brilliant, and other than Bob and Paul in Gone Fishing you are the man . Keep up the great job mate 🍻👍🏼
Fair play to you for giving it a go. I took up match fishing after 25+ years of pleasure angling. It’s a massive step to take and a whole different mentality, and I’m only fishing at club level. The golden rule I was told at the start of my journey is never tell the truth (about your catch. Or your tactics) and never believe what others tell you (about their catch or tactics). It has served me well over the last couple of years! 😂 

In all seriousness though, once you get past the nerves and self consciousness of fishing shoulder to shoulder with some very competent match anglers, it really does force you to think about how you’re fishing and it’s done more to improve my fishing than any amount of books/magazines/videos have ever done. Plus, that first time you frame, even if the prize is a mere tenner is an awesome feeling. Still waiting to get my first win (I’ve been within 2oz), but I’ll get there! 

Great video as always!
Can’t wait to watch love the videos thanks for getting me into this sport loved the video keep it up
My dad was a match angler and remember him telling me tales about winning with small silvers. I enjoy pleasure fishing, I only started up again properly this year and have had some great sessions on my own and with friends. Even when I blank, that time spent outside engaging with your surroundings is priceless. Like you said at the end, fishing is what you make it and for me the removal of life’s stresses for a few hours is cathartic
Bloody awesome Carl. What ever it is you’ve got it. You’re becoming the new John Wilson. He was so watchable just like you and your team. Keep up the good work it’s so appreciated.
As a match angler this film was right up my peg! Big fan of Matt and Rooney.  Would love to see more content like this, maybe try tackling a a match on a commercial venue on the pole would be amazing! Well done on coming so heartbreakingly close though hope you have another go in The future!
Awesome vid as always Carl
Hats off to the match men, catching as many as quickly as possible is a skill in itself but takes the fun out of fishing when there’s pressure and money involved. Pleasure and specimen fishing is definitely the best in my opinion.
Geat video, Carl! Being a former match angler, I know that diving into the match scene as a newbie is no walk in the park. If you're a decent angler, you can rock it when you're in your element, fishing the waters you know and love. It's all about that know-how! 
But to keep knocking it out of the park in different waters, with various fishing styles, tackling different species, and handling all the different situations you might face, you've gotta clock in those years and years of experience. 
I'd love to see you giving it more tries in the future. You've got the gear you need now, and the best guys to support you, for sure! Keep up the great work!
You are so inspiring, Carl!  Way to go on getting the two tickets Omi, this would have been a rather short video if you relied on Carl's computer.  You gave match fishing a shot, Carl, and you were so close to competing in the finals.  I love it when you upload videos, it always makes my weekend.  And I don't say this enough but you are an advocate for people that suffer from anxiety and depression whether you know it or not.
Hope you don't give up so early. Your on the learning curve and should try again next season, building on what you have learnt this year.
The balls it take to put yourself out on youtube from zero! Respect man and you are a great great fisherman! Literally best YouTuber too!
The fact Carl consistently pumps out content that is miles above 90% of the TV being made and with such a small team is insanity

His potential is literally limitless
I work in an fishing shop and the talk I hear about the match scene (I'm a carp angler) tells me two things. It is always the luck of the draw and getting a good peg. And also knowing the venue and how it fishes in various conditions is also key. The guys that do well, fish a LOT of matches and fish the venues on a regular basis. Personally I think it was an incredible result to do as well as you did. Keep it going.
Loved this! Don't give up but do try to keep sane as I bet matches will test your mind management! It would be great to see more near-misses so keep them coming 🎣 👏
I don't even really like coarse fishing, but yet find myself watching all your videos. They are so well put together, epic content mate.

Please try this again, I want to see you make the final..
There is never a dull moment with you Carl, great angler and my favourite.. also thank you for my new jumper and hat from yourself!
Great video As always Carl. I feel sick loosing a fish when I'm just pleasure fishing. Can't imagine how it feels in match.  Great effort mate 👍
I look forward to watching your videos with a cuppa every time you upload them. It's great to watch and see that you remind me of me in many ways. This match fishing journey was great to watch and I hope you have another chance to do this again next year and prove to GURU that you have what it takes.
well done buddy, absolute well done. for me this was one of your bests this year.

Golf life x",411,"Always thought golf was an old man’s sport, but I caught one of your videos a few months ago and I’m hooked on it, now heading into winter having golf lessons and range practice to hopefully get on some courses next year in better weather, it’s all thanks to this channel and what both the videos and the game itself have done for my mental health! Well done boys keep up the great work 👌
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, why Jimmy has changed from his SIM MAX driver to the ping I’ll never know. I have the ping myself and yes it’s a great driver but Jimmy never missed with the sim max. Now he’s leaking left and right. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it Jimmy lad ❤
Another top guest Ollie was. Would be great to see the three Golf Lifers take on three of the cricket team or any team really. Also be good to see Ollie back in summer time as I bet he hits it a mile in dry weather.
Get to get Pope in and hear him speak golf, cricket and get to know him a little. Great how you boys are branching out and reaching other sports people. Just can’t help but love all things golf life. Up the golf life!! 

I do think you should have a team GL v Ben and the Fozcast lot. Have a few challenges/forfeits etc. Maybe invite some of us legends along. Top work Tubes, Ange and the boys ❤
18 months playing this sport now, twice a week, even with the cold snap. Playing off 16 at the moment, my goal is to get to around 12 in the next 2 years. Im 6ft 5 and 17 stone so the driver once hit clean travels, my issue is not having soft enough hands around the approach of the green, anything 80 yards to 50.

Anyway top guest Ollie was, a real nice bloke which really made this video a calm and great watch.
I thought you’d got the Stig playing today guys, and Ollie what a decent young lad 👍🏻👍🏻 keep up the golf life you legends!!
Another great video on a lovely winter morning, young Ollie gave Jimmy a good run for his money. Dressed like he was the birdy dance for Bully should now be called the Seagull !  Keep up the good work boys, you make golf worth watching for a non golfer like me. 😊❤
Love Jimmy dressing in the cricket colours. Looks like an old school caddie  more than anything. Gotta get Jimmy and  tubes vs broad and Anderson on the channel. Love the channel awesome content keep up the work up the golf life
Another cracking video, your getting some great guests for JB to play,it makes this channel the best,well done everyone involved, looking forward to more of the same.👏👏👍
Simply the most entertaining golf YouTube channel. Love the chemistry you guys have. BUT purely for my own entertainment I’d love it if you played the full 9 or 18 regardless of the result. 👍❤️
Love the fact that Jimmy played a round of golf dressed as a Die Hard Villain! Go on Jans Bullard!
Another great video. Great guest Ollie Pope. Some amazing insight into England Cricket. Some cracking golf played too. You’re not getting this content on any other Youtube golf channel. Up the Golf Life 👏
What a great guest Ollie was, such a down to earth,  professional sportsman! Great nature about him, definitely one to get back on the show!
Loving it boys. My golf game in the last 2 months since I been watching your channel has improved so much. I’m out there enjoying golf and having a laugh. My handicap has came down from 22 to 17 so far and dropping. Keep up the inspiration loving the channel
Great video again boys, what about a series of getting Tubes and Ange to single figures? You boys have lessons with your club pro that are filmed and it’s like a journey? Ask us lot what a realistic target is for you both and film over time starting from next season?
Another great video guys! What a legend Pope is! Cracking player. I have never noticed this before, but when he hit his 4 iron it made me wonder if he uses single length irons? Again Tubes, I owe you a beer for Cobra Putter recommendation, I am so impressed with mine, my putting has transformed!
Petition to see Tubes & Ange back playing more!!
Top class again lads. Love the Q+A bit near the end - can see Jimmy was loving. Ollie Pope - absolutely gun bat and can whack a g ball too!
Jimmy Bullard is so balanced on every shot.  Fabulous.
Another belter boys 👌 I’d love to see you three take on Bob Does Sports. Tubes v Bob, Big Ange v Joey D and Jimmy v Fat Perez. Think they’d all be close matches and great entertainment.",17,Sports,251000,PT55M15S

#kurtisconner",7115,"when i see a new kurtis upload i jump up and down and squeal like a little pig
thinking we’d actually get a barbie analysis from kurtis was too good to be true
I understand the trilogy has come to an end… but a bonus round comparing Barbie video games to Bratz video games is kind of warranted.

i loved that kurtis reverted back to POC women to tell their stories of how whitewashing these bratz characters hurt POC women. an ally through and through
""How dare thee call me a wizard"" has to be one of the greatest throwaway jokes of all time
I don't think I'm ready for the Barbie vs. Bratz series to end.
mad respect for the pokemon sponsor this is probably the only time i haven't skipped the sponsorship bc i felt so happy for kurtis
as a Barbie girl from childhood to now, I am PRAYING for a new and/or “remake” of the Bratz live-action. Barbie was PHENOMENAL for what it was, imagine what we could have with BRATZ?! And to add: we NEED a better monster high live-action. I said what I said.
So glad the microchips line that's been one of my vocal stims for years is finally getting the recognition it deserves.
watching the bratz movie when it came out at 8 years old i was convinced it was a cinematic masterpiece. it might have flopped at the box office but they know their audience and hit the mark perfectly
Literally just made my heart soar that you watched and loved Lifesized as much as many of us did.
Congratulations on being sponsored by Pokémon!!! So proud and happy for you!!
As a bratz girlie my heart aches that this masterpiece of a barbie film is compared to what they gave us with Bratz
Glad the “you dont have a daddy OR a bankaccount” line got the recognition it deserves. Been on my mind for years 😭💀
as a hispanic person, yasmin's part was so accurate
i love waking up every morning saying buenos dias to my mariachi in my living room
You should actually never end this series and actually make a hundred more, please and thanks. Target audience reached.
idc how “bad” the bratz live action is, it will always be part of my core memories
The moment Life Size came on screen... Literally no contest. Absolutely iconic!
Her saying “you don’t sound deaf” is wild 

His quick “you don’t look ignorant but you can’t judge a book I guess” comeback was amazing.",23,Comedy,4740000,PT49M29S

Danny not knowing the nutcracker was a ballet with no words is probably the most entertaining part of this video
For me, Barbie in the Nutcracker will always be the superior adaptation.
I would just like to point out that Danny’s little nutcracker guy is not even a nutcracker. It’s a toy soldier.

I could not take it with the dad’s reaction to the pebble I was laughing so hard. The blank stare, the trembling hands. The concerned look from his wife. Like what could this rock have possibly done to you?? Why do they never talk about it again??
I love how what started as a quirky and unconventional Nutcracker adaption quickly spiraled into an existential nightmare that only left Danny with more questions than answers about the original tale.
Fun fact: This movie was funded by literal Russian state and was the most expensive Russian movie to date.
Ill be honest, as a ballerina, just seeing your takes on the actual ballet was _hysterical_
I would GLADLY watch you review ballets! Swan Lake has like 4 different endings, i think you should pick a random recorded version and make a bet to see who survives.
As a ballerina, watchig you react to the real nutcracker was hilarious. Especially when you referred to Fritz as ""this little freak"".
That end bit scared me so bad. I actually gasped with horror and my heart skipped a beat. Seeing Danny staring at the camera with that vacant grin and facepaint was the most terrifying thing I've witnessed in a while
It's nice to see Danny hasn't lost his Christmas spirit even after his room was broken into and all his stuff was stolen.
Can we appreciate how well this comes into a full circle with that one skit from a long time ago with Danny's toy soldier becoming a real boy through the glass.
I laughed so hard I fell off my bed when he said ""He misses his pebble.""
I'm honestly surprised that Danny didn't make the connection that Love on a Leash ALSO had a supernatural esque love interest that was a horrid piece of sht in their cursed form and completely entirely normal in their human form. Now I just wanna know if there's any more movies with characters like that
What a stunning cast... Baby Elle Fanning, Snowbell from Stuart Little, and Moaning Myrtel all working together to make the most amazing rendition of The Nutcracker the world's ever seen...
Hiring Albert Einstein as a babysitter is the most hilarious flex I've ever seen.
Thank you for watching the ballet Danny! Sincerely, every ballet dancer who has suffered through performing the Nutcracker
My little sister was obsessed with nutcracker a few years ago. I rented this for her hoping she'd love it. I feel so bad 😥🤕
In all the versions of the nutcracker I've seen, Drosselmeyer has a clown/assistant guy with him not a child. I've always loved the energy of just showing up to a family event with your clown friend who doesn't break character the entire time.",23,Comedy,6360000,PT28M49S

LENNY ~ a hidden character representing happiness & good energy
http://instagram.com/lenny",5531,"Instant classic, flow, knowledge, and video off the chart
Jack Harlow was smooth and held his own and Dave gotta be one of the most sickest rappers to walk the earth
Dave has literally mastered rapping at whatever pace he chooses. So relaxed and smooth man
Dave is properly a master at the verses that go on for ages. This is probably the best song I’ve heard from Jack too
Shout out to all the LOAN survivors 🙌
UK rappers are finally getting love in the US. It took way too long but anyone who hasn't been following UK Grime and Drill is going to be surprised at the talent that's been overlooked.
Harlow went fucking crazy! One of his top tracks for sure 🔥🔥
Dave is genuinely an expert at the lengthy verses. I think this is Jack's best song yet as well.
Jack’s really following his mentors footsteps with this level of consistency, he is really going places.
Man Jack’s progression is crazy🔥
Jack&dave never disappoints
They both slid!!! This beat is absolutely perfect on the ears I wouldn't mind a collaboration album from these two!! Dave is that guy !!!
Both artists ending the year with an absolute banger
The collab we didn't know we needed! Blown away both went crazy
Dope bars from both artists! The end of year collabo we didn't expect.
Can't get over how well this video is shot. Videography + editing on another level! Huge props to Cole and the crew.
This is so fire, artist's need to make more songs like this.
Jack's best verse by far, well done. Dave snapped as usual.
As espected from Dave and Jack - perfect lyrics, rythm and sound
Dave is so good with words... Look at the bars and how collected and smooth he is. Top notch delivery😊",24,Entertainment,21500000,PT4M41S

If that doesn't work, then continue doing what you're doing
One thing I like about the prefab builds is they're modular; You can knock out the walls on a double shack and replace them with Shack Doors to create passible outbuildings.
Biggest building issue I've had is there doesn't seem to be a way to change the elevation of your non-prefab Foundations, making it hard to keep things at the same level.
Destroying bushes is actually easier with a sword
for me rn traveling is the main issue, it cant be that u have to walk 10 mins just to get to a cave once u mined the 2 caves kinda nearby your village or walk 20 mins to the next dessert just so you can die bcs u didnt know that the mobs there are way stronger
You can also build campfires inside of caves instead of using torches , yes it costs more wood however it’ll light up the cave for you so it’s easier to find whatever your looking for
Before commenting understand that deliberately exploiting is cheating, not a tip
Don’t just throw away tools that you don’t use. Use a villager as a follower and you can give them those tools and they will use it. They can hold multiple tools and just swap to the best one depending on the situation.
Really Fantastic Synopsis and Tips. You nailed it! I would add: 
-Build Your First Village at the Edge of a Desert Border AND Near a Knotwood cave, NOT where you spawn into the game. Make your life easier and everything more efficient!
-Build a Bed at the Mouth of a Cave as a Save Point. If you die, you respawn in your bed; you won't have to travel back to your quest point.
-Empty almost ALL of your Backpack before beginning a Quest. You'll need the inventory slots.
-Pack for a trip! MAX Wood Planks to build Repair Chests, Cooked Food, Snowberry Shakes or Cheesy Burgers
Its good to stack lumber mills, it makes crafting so much quicker
something I always do with the spare pickaxes is give it to one designated adventuring villager and whenever I need to collect granite I take that villager and start going at some rocks. unfortunately they still use the pickaxes for fighting even over axes, even tho the brown pickaxe does less damage per second compared to just punching, so keep that in mind if ur messing about in the dark with them
If you find a boulder on a hill and you need mats just push the boulder down hill towards whatever you need and it’ll destroy everything for you
Go on top of moutains that have large trees, cut them down, roll the log down to farm granite and wood super easy
I love to make a village stylish and neat, it is the most important thing! 😊
Man, this was one of the coolest surprises of the year.  I've always thought a minecraft style game in the lego world would be awesome.  Who'd have thought it would be fortnite to do it
You’re lucky - the desert is a 10 minute run away from my spawn point and that’s with infinite stamina.  However, the cold biome is 2 steps away
Make glider , build staircases 11 high. Make platform and u now got a jump pad that will take u way further then the geysers and as soon as I land I build another one so I can basically do the whole map under 10 mins instead of an hour lol I even put a marker on every staircase jump pad so I know the direction they follow back to back , helps tons on the map
Stamina bar is important, when youre flying with a glider, it consumes your stamina while up in the air, by the time you run out, you will drop from fall damage and die.
I personally think temp don’t matter as much,but stam will literally make you op in the beginning bc u can just outrun most early in things like wolves
i noticed when you broke your grill the village points didn't go down, so technically ig you could just place down a crap ton of grills, lumber mills, work benches, etc. then destroy them to get the materials back and do it again and again
The way i get the sand shells is by using a shield and getting one of my villagers to follow me. That way my follower can get the attention and i can go ham for the shells. And the shield helps if the randomly start going for you",20,Gaming,468000,PT11M8S

epic fortnite chapter 5 season OG moments 

USE CODE CREAMY IN THE FORTNITE ITEM SHOP",1569,"If they update regularly this game is gunna be nuts.
I like the new Fortnite Lego game mode it’s something new and fresh.
imagine telling someone who hasnt played since chapter 1 that this is what fortnite would be like
lets be honest. It's way better than we all expected
One can only imagine how they're going to continue developing the mode, it has so much potential, i cant wait to see where we go from here, personally im loving it and im aware its not everyones cup of tea
Also, I found out, if you’re behind a bush while killing the boss dude, he won’t attack you, he gets confused. Also, another glitch, if you put down a new chest and put your swords, farming tools, etc in it, and punch it to break it, it heals your weapons and farming tools (note this will be patched asap I’m sure). But it works for now!
I hope you enjoyed the new mode, it's been a ton of fun for me and the boys :)
I think the second best thing with the update is fixing the issue some people had with the game crashing in the lobby. As a person who experienced that myself, today was my first time playing Chapter 5. I absolutely loved Battle Royale but I clocked in nearly 4 hours straight in LEGO
I had some experience with Motion Capture for video games and gotta say they created a seriously fluid and cool movement animations and choreography overall. Kudos to the devs. It's a funny detail you wouldn't neccessary expect in a game like this one. Ps. You almost saw me as Leon in these new Resident Evil games :)
So far, this mode is pretty similar to minecraft, if they update regularly, this can become an original masterpiece.
Keep it up Creamy! The new mode is really fun tho.🔥
You know it’s a good day when McCreamy uploads
I've been playing mostly following the typical tutorial stuff, but you gave me so many ideas on how to be more creative!! I'm so excited for this game mode. There's so many possibilities!
McCreamy is a legend. Bro makes a boring day into a good one, love this guy. ❤
I think that this is the best day that they’ve had in a while. Amazing job Fortnite! 🎉❤
McCreamy never fails to make good content 😅 😱
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 💖💖💖
I love how he steps out of his way just to entertain us
you can tell this mode is gonna be succesfull and i trust epic games in keeping it updated and interesting
The fact that McCreamy does this for OUR entertainment is just gold. We all love you McCreamy! 😅 😅",20,Gaming,10500000,PT19M40S

#TomPetty #LoveIsALongRoad #GTA6",2794,"Tom Petty got a whole new generation of fans, Rockstar always has good taste
It hit so hard when I heard the first few notes in the trailer. RIP Legend

Soon, we’ll be back in Vice City brothers
This song is going to be stuck in my head for the next 10-15 years. Thanks Rockstar and especially thanks to Tom Petty for having produced such a master piece! Rest well!
This song will be remembered for a long time, a perfect Rockstar Games choice.
RIP Tom. A whole new generation of fans over a 90 second trailer. You will live forever.
80s music will truly never die
Love that a younger generation is discovering a true American Icon. RIP Tom, you’re a legend.
Why does older music always hit 10x's harder than modern music? This is so good, and I feel so stupid for sleeping on this masterpiece for all these years.
Been a huge Tom Petty fan for decades and I can only applaud a new generation of fans coming in. Truly timeless rock music!
The fact that this song is finally getting the respect it’s always had but from a younger generation eases my heart! Can’t wait to hear the playlists they got lined up! I’m 42 years old! I’ve loved this song since I first heard it in late 80’s headed into the 90’s Tom Petty was born 10 years late and for great measure! Now as an older man, who just hopes he can play the next gta! Not sure if I’ll make it to 7, but I’m hoping I can make it rdr3! But hey that’s the rockstar life! Cheers to Tom Petty the coolest rockstar there ever was! Dude quit touring and was like, time to OD! Gangster! RIP!
This music is going to be stuck in my head until 2025... A such masterpiece
One thing Rockstar never disappoints us with is good taste for music
Tom would be so blown away and appreciative of the new love this track is getting. The entire album is a banger and worth checking out.
This is actually one of the best albums ever made. Welcome new fans. :)
We miss you so much Tom. Thank you for the glorious wealth of real music you left us.❤❤🎉
essa musica vai entrar para historia
Esse cantor ja se tornou uma lenda e vai ser lembrado sempre... Se ele estivesse vivo estaria pulando de felicidade por ver sua música fazendo muito sucesso.
La primera vez que escuchó una canción de este cantante y la verdad me encanto,soy muy fans de las canciones de los 80,y esta canción encaja perfectamente en mis gustos
Essa e uma das melhores músicas que ja vi em um trailer

Can't wait to see 20+mins of shayne not being able to take compliments
Shayne is such a talent and has been such a great addition to smosh.
Really happy to see where smosh is currently.
I almost teared up when Anthony at the end says that Shayne has kept the true meaning of Smosh there all along by just having fun with friends on camera. It's so true and that's what makes Smosh so special. Especially the cast now. You can see how close everyone is with each other and from Ian and Anthony to Chance and Angela. (the newest cast members) Everyone just puts a big smile on my face!
come back next week for a new *Assumptions episode with OPENLY GAY PASTORS*
MEMBERS WATCH UNCENSORED & AD FREE▸ https://youtube.com/anthonypadilla/join
Man, at the beginning, when Anthony started listing all the eras Shayne went through, I got so sad. These people carried Smosh through it's darkest times but they were so underappreciated because people were blinded with nostalgia of old Smosh. Shayne, Courtney, Damien etc. truly are the unsung heroes of Smosh.
I’ll basically watch Shayne do anything for any amount of time.
I love this era of smosh. Smosh has been pretty transparent and communicative towards fans and seeing all the ups and downs of the company makes this moment much more sweeter. We're now honoring Smosh for everything they've done. and seeing how they've become a giant family warms my heart. What a time to be alive.
Shayne’s depth as a human is what made me enjoy Smosh more… I remember them showing up at his apartment one time and seeing how well read he is. As someone else who LOVES reading and thinks it, more than anything else, can develop a person, that was nice to see :) he’s genuine, intelligent, and over the top absurd. Love him!
Dearest Shayne, I can’t tell you how much it means to everyone that you have stayed on Smosh this entire time. We don’t know what we would ever do without you. You are not only hilarious, but you are genuinely sweet and care sooo much about getting to know each cast and crew member. I see how invested you are in other people. We all love you and please keep doing what you’re doing.
Ian and Anthony are the parents of Main but Pit and Games are Shayne’s babies. He really carried those channels for so long, my respect for him grew so much during the pandemic. Woo Shayne, Shayne it up!
I actually really like the idea of interviewing Smosh cast members.
Shayne is just such a pleasant person, he seems so fun and nice to be around. Love seeing Anthony and Shayne together again. The ""We Bought Smosh"" arc really is the best timeline.
The way Shayne describes the pride he feels in creating a beloved character is how I know he has the brain of an artist
Him being so kind and humble and sweet and hardworking and mad funny while having an imposter syndrome ... deserves the world honestly
I’m glad that Shayne is getting some flowers. He’s clearly a comedy powerhouse, and very hardworking and loyal, but he also just seems like a genuinely kind person. I’m sure success will find him whatever he gets up to, but I’m glad it’s Smosh right now :)
I respect everything that Shane has done (as he is my favorite cast member), he is a multi talented individual that has brought so much to Smosh & has helped kept it alive alongside Courtney & Ian.
Not trying to discredit the other team members who have helped with keeping the channel alive of course but I feel like having those 3 people at the forefront and all the sacrifices they made have paid off in a big way.
I'm gonna be honest, the only reason i started watching smosh and still watch smosh is because of Shayne. I find him the MOST funny, comforting, relatable and inspiring personality on the internet. LOVE YOU SHAYNE
I don’t know if Shayne was holding back tears but when he was speaking it really made me cry. Like… I remember that scene of the office when Jim says that the documentary people gave them the blessing of being able to actually look back into their lives. And we can see all that with Shayne, Anthony, and the rest of the Smosh crew. They’re all incredible people and it’s awesome to see how far they have all grown.
Shayne seriously rules, him being popular enough to have his own thing going, but just not doing it because being around the others is just too fun... is so genuine and heartwarming. Jeez. Im floored. Massive talent and heart. Courtney and him kept the dream alive, now Amanda and Angela are also just such fun stand-outs. This era is peak.",27,Education,7580000,PT31M26S

From Bethesda and Arkane Lyon, the studio that brought you Dishonored and “DEATHLOOP”, Marvel’s Blade is a mature, single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris, now in development in collaboration with Marvel Games.

If Blade turns out to be as good as Dishonored 2, it will be a memorable experience. Being 100% single-player is a great start.
I could’ve shed a tear when they said it’ll be a third-person single player game.

Thank you Arkane Lyon!
Getting a fresh line up just before running the fade is the most Blade thing ever
SO glad that a gameplay-focused studio like Arkane is doing Blade, some of the most fluid Gun/Sword gameplay in the Biz.
Perfect mix of character, studio and platform!
Can't wait to see more of this!
Finally!!!!! One of my favorite characters gets his own game. I love the dark, ominous feel that this has. 3rd person single player too? Yes please.
Ive watched this trailer atleast 100 times and still cant get over it. I just get excited that someone is making blade.
Loving the art style already. This is definitely going to be visually stunning
Love the addition of the crosses scattered around and how the sunlight makes a cross shape in the shop. It gives a good idea of how paranoid and scary this world is full of vampires.
Esto será un gran juego, gracias por su esfuerzo desarrolladores
THIS!!! A BLADE Game is a FANTASTIC idea. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾This has so much potential the artstyle, colour and lighting is astonishing. The character designs look amazing even the baber looks good and Blade looks like he came straight off the pages. 

And the fact this is going to be 3rd person is just what it needed, the elements of Dishonoured and Deathloop could easily be translated and built upon to fit Blades combat and abilities. Out of the upcoming marvel games this is my Favourite.
Glad to see Blade gets a new game. Hopefully they will do the character justice. Fingers crossed.
The fact that we’re getting the game before the movie is bizarre but I’m so excited I can’t wait for it. This looks so dope.
Esse jogo do blade vai ser foda demais, bom trabalho marvel e que venham mais jogos!!!
Vou voltar aqui todos os dias para apreciar essa obra de arte
Muito interessante,aparentemente sera uma animação linda
Se imaginan ahora un universo de videojuegos de marvel. Esto sin duda sera mejor q el cine ya que es algo que podemos vivir en carne propia sino q tendra total libertad creativa a la hora de tratar a los personajes y mas profundidad

Lyrics:
Hotels
Late nights
Hands through my hair
Long talks
Red eyes
Clothes everywhere
Missing a moment when you’re still there
You gotta thing you can’t find nowhere 

Yeah-yeah
Kissing
Screaming
Straight back to war
I’m walking out until I lock the door
Maybe the danger’s covered by the thrill
Cause I know I should be running for the hills 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me
And keep me around like it’s easy
Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

I know that when it’s all done
I’ll hate you bad in the long run
But somehow it never ends
My heels on the edge of your bed again, yeah
I get obsessive with you
All that I want is attention from you
Break into my life and break all my rules, it’s true 

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah
It cuts me
Cause I know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up
Don’t tease me 
And keep me around like it’s easy  

Cause you know deep down that it’s
Never gonna ever be us, ohhh
Never gonna ever be more than just something that’s fucking me up 

Should be running for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run for the hills, should run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Should run, run, run for the hills, should be running for the hills
The way you touch me
Huh huh

All that I want is attention from you
Break into my life and break all my rules, it's true

[Chorus]
The way you touch me
Straight to the heart yeah, it cuts me
'Cause I know deep down that it's
Never gon' ever be us (Uh, uh, uh)
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's 'messing' me up
Don't tease me, and keep me around like it's easy
When you know deep down that it's 
Never gon' ever be us (Uh, uh, uh)
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's 'messing' me up

[Outro]
Should run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should be runnin' for the hills (Ah, ah)
The way you touch me (Ah, ah)
Should run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should be runnin' for the hills (Ah, ah)
The way you touch me (Ah, ah)
(Ooh) Should run, run— (Ah, ah)
Run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should be runnin' for the hills (Ah, ah)
The way you touch me (Ah, ah)
(Should run for the hills)
Should run, run— (Ah, ah)
Run for the hills (Ah, ah)
Should be runnin' for the hills (Ah, ah)
The way you touch me (Ah, ah)

Sorry for the confusion, i made the list for myself,added the games i interested with. Btw there is other comments with
timestamps for the full event, you can look for them
The orchestra was more than deserting of a bunch of Oscar’s. The Flute Guy especially man, he absolutely nailed it.
I loved hearing the Alan Wake director speak on both occassions, he has such a great way with words and his passion and pride in what the whole team has made is really touching.
1:29:15 Loved Geoff Keighley laughing when the audience cheered for the Hello Kitty game! Best moment for me.
Let's all be honest flute guy deserved an award out of almost everyone there, what a legend
Congratulations Larian, you absolutely deserve all these awards and more!🎉😊
Congratulations to every other winner/nominee as well.

In all honesty BG3 is by far the best in every category they were nominated for imo, but I'm happy TOTK, FF16, Alan Wake 2 and Hi-Fi Rush won some awards as well. Would have been perfect if Lies of P won best art direction.
Sami Järvi (a.k.a. Sam Lake) just IS Remedy Entertainment!!
This guy is living his job. 
Performing the choriography with Poets shows another time that he is really pouring his heart into the games this company make.
Remedy pretty much never dissappoints.
Cheers!
Flute Guy is the pillar of The Game Awards that absolutely everyone can get behind. We may all like different games, but our celebration of Flute Guy is unanimous.
Huge congratulations to Neil Newbon and all the other Baldur's gate 3 makers. You have truly made a phenomenal game and im so glad its getting the accolades it deserves!!
A game dev that is so committed to his game that he goes to an awards show in a suit of FREAKING ARMOUR kinda deserves the win, huh. Keep making games, Larian!

COOKD OUT NOW - https://cookd.store/",3468,"I did not sleep since lego came out so i could film and edit this... and its still only 9 minutes :)
Other streamers: crying when friends blow up their house 

Lazar: Builds his own house just to blow it up
The fact that the Lego mode came out 2 days ago proves that Lazar can make videos in that time frame.

We’ve caught him.
The fact that Lannan is happy and healthy enough to do uploads so quickly really brings me joy! Really gives early Lazar vibes!
I find it hilarous that Lazar can screw around with literally anything his heart desires.
Hands down one of the best gamemodes we’ve gotten
Always gonna be a good day when Lazar uploads 🔥🔥
Lazar never fails to break any game within 12 hours of its release
Poor ceeday getting roasted 😭
Lazar being this consistent feels unreal.
It's truly legendary that Lazar is still using the gingerbread skin despite there being a *LITERAL SKIN* of him
Your creativity in this Lego Fortnite video is off the charts, just like the designs in ytgw0010. Truly inspiring work!
So cool thing about these Golems is that they're not actually Desert-specific? Either that, or they change colour according to whichever biome they're in.
Lazar complaning about ceeday not uploading with his upload schedule is criminal
The difference in the amount of time that Lazarbeam streamed and the and the amount of time this video is just proves how much he cares about us to be entertained
Lazar always finds a way to break every game in existence.
I have to say this, but this felt like an old lazarbeam video. I love just the goofy ideas and music it makes me happy to see this kind of content again. Thanks Lannan!
Lazar will never fail to attempt to break everything he finds, even mully's collarbone

I approve
No way new HelloGames game?!

I love how this trailer was made in the same exact way that NMS trailers usually are.
Can't wait for this, looks beautiful!
The fact that the same team who created a universe are daunted by the idea of making a single planet is a very, very good thing. That's a sign that they're aiming for density on a much smaller scale, despite that scale still being so much bigger than what anyone else has ever pulled off
I genuinely cannot wait.  You guys are some of the hardest working devs around and I really respect how hard and long you guys worked on making NMS an incredible game. I’m more than happy to support you guys in future projects and this one looks like everything I love in one game. So excited!!
Seeing how far they've come with NMS compared to its initial release makes this game very promising. Even if it's not everything we hope for or expect at the beginning, we no they're 100% capable of making it better over time.
As a NMS player since day one, I'm all in for Light No Fire!
After the (eventual) epic success of NMS, Hello Games is now one of the few game developers I trust to deliver. I can't wait to explore this world.
I like that the fact they are sticking to what they are good at and hopefully improving on (Larian studios did the same and we know how that turned out this year), I am genuinely excited for this! I can see this being a huge improvement from NMS for the simple reason it's just one world which they can build on density.
Having witnessed the commitment they have shown to No Mans Sky, I’m all in on this. (Also No Mans Sky on PSVR2 is INSANE!)
Love the artstyle!! Looks really interesting and after delivering NMS you really deserve that this will be a success!
What I’m hoping for most is a world that encourages exploration with good rewards, and some kind of engaging story. If they can pull off both of those this game will be incredible
Everything about this is pure vibes. The atmosphere, the track selection for the video, the editing. Very well done. Cannot wait to play this!!!
I don’t even know how I feel, no man sky is one of my favorite games after that we have fantasy medieval genre, and you guys delivered that 🎉😂 can’t wait
I just want to say, I'm a huge fan of your guys' work. You guys put passion first and money second, unlike the vast majority of companies today.
Feels like a natural next step from something like Valheim, which is probably my favourite game ever. Excited for this. The redemption story is nearly fully complete.
I cherish each of you! transforming an incredible system into a fantastical setting. Great choice of song as well; I adore Alt-J. I'm already very excited about this.
This looks great. Take your time guys. It's done when it's done. Don't let yourselves get pushed like last time. You've build a lot of good will over the years, the community is ready to wait and let you cook.
I remember playing nms and thinking about how much better it would be if you guys focused all the procedural content into one planet  (  not saying your procedural universe was bad )  turns out you guys were already making that a reality long before I ever even conceived it....I dont usually get hyped for games....but I am completely hyped for this one.
This is going to be an amazing experience. I hope it has full mod support.",20,Gaming,115000,PT2M6S

www.jurassicparksurvival.com",6126,"Holy cow, not only is it a ""Jurassic Park"" game instead of ""Jurassic World"" to change it up, but it's a an official survival horror game we've been wanting for years? 🤯
If this is anything like Alien Isolation then we're in for the biggest treat ever. Man I love that they're going back to what made dinosaurs scary in the first place.
It's incredible how Jurassic Park has a different sense of tension than Jurassic World
YES FINALLY!!! I've been waiting for something like this for years 😭
To me the Ford Explorer and Jeep Wrangler will forever be the real heroes of Jurassic Park. Takes me right back to my childhood.
I can't believe they're making an actual Jurassic Park survival horror game! This looks incredible, the attention to level of detail e.g the Ford Explorer, the Jeep Wrangler, the Dinosaurs. I like the idea of exploring how other characters are fighting for survival during the events of Jurassic Park.

Hopefully this game doesn't disappoint.
I’ve always wanted a Jurassic Park game like this!!
As a huge Dino fan. This is something I’m eyeing the most to come out, I don’t care how short or long. I can tell I’m going to throughly enjoy this
The original island....the original park! This feels like the sequel we deserved in theaters in the 90's. I don't even play new games anymore, but I'm really excited just to see this and experience it as a fan. 💿 🎥
It seems like the studios are finally listening to what old school fans have been asking for years now ! It looks promising !🦖💯
I've been imagining a game like this for about 20 years. They finally made one.
I’ve never wanted anything more in my life. I KNEW they were gonna do something like this at some point. So happy to finally see it.
This is what I’ve been wanting from Jurassic park!!
The makers of Jurassic World must take note from this game. This is what a true Jurassic movie should look and feel like. We need adrenaline pumping survivor movies not highfiveing dinosaur movies.
What I would really like in the game Jurassic Park Survival is to see species that so far have only been mentioned in the film but which have never appeared physically in the park, and to see them physically in the game for the first time in their original versions from 1993, it would be completely crazy. For example we have the Proceratosaurus, the Metriacanthosaurus, the Segisaurus, Herrerasaurus and the Baryonyx, this would really be an opportunity and a way to further expand the universe of Jurassic Park and to extend the number of species that have unfortunately never seen and which did not appear, just to fill in the deficiencies and the dark sides that there were in the first film, it allows us to fill a void. 🙏
I'm going to need more gameplay footage.  Looks suspiciously like a jump-scare funhouse, walk and look adventure.
This looks incredible. Already got me wanting to play this game without even seeing much gameplay. Thanks for sharing this trailer!
The music,the scenes,the dinos,same place! Everything is on point! I bet playing this will feel like a Jurassic park sequel but you are in it.

#antiques #vintage #exclusive #boise #remymartin #cognac #baccarat",112,"So what I hear is she can drink and enjoy the cognac and still sell the bottle for $2000. That's a win win
Rémy Martin is my favorite cognac.  I always wanted to try a shot of their very old vintage cognac but I’m too cheap to spend a few hundred dollars on an ounce or two of anything.
Somehow $8k seems 'cheap'.. for something to be nearly 100 years old, complete in box, the finest variant of a famous Cognac... feels like it should be way more!
Enjoy this show to this day. It's amazing what you can learn about the items people bring hoping THEY ARE WORTH SOMETHING.
Would sell for over 10k.
Leave alone for another 15 years and you'd have a 100 year old brandy... Awesome.
Just drink it and enjoy! Its just a bottle of alcohol not the holy grail 😊
It may have value as a rare collector's piece, but I don't believe cognac ages once it's bottled. That happens in casks/barrels before bottling. The fact that there's been evaporation makes me worry that the seal has been compromised and the cognac inside may not be especially tasty. I guess we'll never know. :)
I would think that the only value in the cognac would be the enjoyment of it. Otherwise, it's worthless.
REMY Martian Cognac is among the finest spirits you can get. They distilled for a few years in Sonoma County . Alambic Brandy. Angles Breath filled the   Cask Room. 1990’s Unfortunately My only last bottle was drank by a bunch of ungrateful people who didn’t even know what it was without permission. I have a bottle of Mistel Noel from the distillery and keep it in a safe place
Would pair nicely with a 90 year old Coke Zero
8,000... doubt that. 

At auction I'd expect insanely higher prices.

Remember this is the finest cognac possible said by Remy Martin. And cognac bottles have gone in excess of $1m

I think a fair estimate would be $100k to $250k
My 50th my wife bought me a bottle of Dom perignon (1971) We shared it on a mountain resort sitting in a wood fired hot tub over looking the Canadian rockies And a valley river ..Got make your life full of good memories
Hard liquor bottled in cristal bottles contain high levels of lead that leeches from the glass. Not to be consumed. The longer it sits in the bottle, the higher the lead content.
Sell it! You can never drink it, and it could go bad or break at any time.
Drinking Cognac makes me feel like the grown up in the room. 🥃 Just 1 sip, if only.✨
That kind of bottle was a gift to me. I moved, and it went missing.
I just watched ""The Holdovers"" yesterday and this is the same bottle that Paul Giamatti's character chugs in the car!
Just seen an identical bottle in the recent movie The Holdover (2023) Great film btw, worth checking out.
The bottle should be signed. The bottle should have a number etched on the bottom that must match the number etched on the bottom of the stopper. These bottles are so well known. There are collectors who collect the empty bottles. So not sure why this appraiser acts as if he is unsure of his appraisal. This cognac is better known as Louis the 13th.",24,Entertainment,252000,PT3M32S

Good to see west Indies winning😇

The last time England won a series in the Caribbean was in the ODI series in 2014. Congrats to Windies for prolonging the streak.
You almost would've thought this to be an England home game with the cheers the boys in blue were receiving!
Nice to see West Indies players are bringing back that vibes to the cricket loving nation. Windies fans deserved this moment. They bring carnival atmosphere to Cricket. We miss you all. Hope this series win will set up a big step towards your Cricket journey. Lots of love from Sri Lankan fans❤️👍👊
Darren Sammy always brings the magic he is the X factor for the West Indies always has been 👏🏼🙏🏽
I THINK WEST INDIES CRICKET IS BACK CONGRATULATIONS WEST INDIES LOVE FROM PAKISTAN 🇵🇰❤️
West Indies Play Very Good Cricket in their home. It is difficult to face them in their home. 2024 T20 WC Will be One of the best. No Flat Pitches, 50/50 advantage to bowling and batting, excited overloaded ☺️😁
Am i the only West Indian that feels super proud of this achievement. Mr. Sammy is slowly but surely creating a culture within that team which speaks to fighting for victories and i have to also provide massive kudos to Mr.Hope highlighting to players that"" yes you always have  more time than you think in the batting department. Can't leave out Shepherd which in my opinion was player of the series, wickets when it was crucial and finishing games when it seemed all hope was lost. Shepherd is going to be a crucial member of west indian success going forward along with Athanaze.


WELL PLAYED GUYS, LETS US NOT SETTLE FOR THIS VICTORY🎉🎉🎉
West Indies could have been played WC.We missed their hitting.Come back as champions as you were❤
W.Indies didnt quality but this doesnt make them worst team. They have many match winners , just need to put all together as team efforts. They are never a easy side to beat.
Both carty and athanaz needs to learn  that when you are set you don’t give it away. I’m a huge athanaz fan and early in he’s career I’ve realize he has done it a few times yesterday he played across the line the first game played a bad shot. Yesterday carty after getting a hard fought 50 gave it away. Congrats to West Indies on a series win after 25 years wow never knew it was that long Kudos to Hope and he’s team on the series win. Great debut for Mathew Forde wish him all the best 🎉🎉. One to enjoy for now so let’s do the same in the t20 series and try go to Australia and atleast show some fight
IT IS GREAT TO SEE THE BRAND OF CRICKET WINDIES PLAY AT THEIR BEST! These young lads have great talents. I wish they do not play IPL rubbish and get spoiled. If they are nutured well they will be next world cup winners by far! Goodluck Windies love from Sri Lanka
Even though I'm English, It's good to see the Windies bounce back.
And England need to answer some questions now.
Good going West Indies. Victory sure does feel sweet. Shepherd is consistently becoming a finisher for West Indies.
This victory not only for West indies players but for every cricket fan around the world I'm happy to see west indies cricket  reviving again so much much congratulations all of you love from India
Come back of Indies will be legendary 🎉
They are on their way ✅
After all we’ve been through this feels really great. West Indies ❤
It's too early to that WI cricket is back but I relish this win.  Congrats to WI on a fine ODI series. May we continue to fight and win in all forthcoming One Day Internationals.

Kratos brutalizing enemies to his old music just hits different. And after followng his journey, ending with his new music feels very special.

I am absolutely certain that if 1% of humanity increased the level of interest and passion in what they did, regardless of what that may be, to even a fraction of what you do with and for coffee the world would be a much better place.
Thank you James for encouraging people, through coffee, to do more, do better and question what they do.
The reason you're not seeing particle size differences in your particle sized analyser is probably because it breaks up the electroclumps during the measuring process. No idea the details of how the machine works, but it would be far from surprising if it was violent enough to the micron sized particles to break up the electroclumps into their constituent grains.
It’s fascinating that the spritzing makes a MEASURABLE difference to the extraction of the espresso. I could totally see “well in theory this should have a marginal benefit but in reality it’ll probably never mean anything,” but it’s amazing that they were able to actually measure a meaningful, quantitative change.
I love the citizen science your channel is promoting, and that you're encouraging mixed and unclear results to be shared. There is a signal here, we just can't see it yet. Keep sharing, keep signal boosting, and keep experimenting!
If you close your eyes you can experience what it’s like to have Jon Hamm describe coffee physics to you
I think when collecting data from lots of people, tracking relative humidity in the air might be really important. I keep my house really dry (~30%) for 3D printing, and I see a massive amount of static cling on my grinder, which doesn’t have any bottleneck. So RH may be a significant source of noise.

It’s always a pleasure to watch these videos. And even more of a pleasure to watch James slowly transition from barista to a coffee research scientist with his own laboratory
Decided to try this again after giving up on misting beans ages ago.  Somehow forgot that I’d since repurposed the atomizer for adding orange blossom water to homemade orgeat.  While I can’t endorse deliberately using orange blossom water in your coffee grinder, it certainly made for an interesting espresso and a real Proustian moment while I played “what the hell is that weird perfume flavor?”
My suggestion for the slowing flow rate would be that the coating of water on all the coffee particles drastically increases the capillary action of the coffee bed, which usually I would think is fairly hydrophobic if dry. The oils in the coffee also probably don't help with that. If you try to water dry soil versus slightly damp soil, you see the effect of a thin water coating makes orders of magnitude of difference. So a stronger capillary force from the already present water allows the coffee to be drawn into the packed bed more evenly and reduces the chances of channels forming, leading to higher leaching rates and slower flow rates. This is not contrary to what the prof said. It might be a combination of both.
Even though I'm not ""that into"" coffee and usually just guess each time I make it, I absolutely love your videos. It's not just the information, but the candor, the dedication without obsession, and the curiosity. I wish there were clones of you making YouTube videos on different topics - it'd be a better world.
This is fascinating!  There's a nugget here about grinding frozen coffee.  I've been freezing beans for freshness since I use coffee pretty slowly.  An unintended result is that when I take out a dose of 18 grams of beans to grind, pretty quickly they get covered in a nice even layer of condensation because they are so cold.  It's like getting a mist and mix for no effort.  Hard to control the amount (which is a function of time and the relative humidity in the room), but interesting nonetheless.  I've also had no issues with grinding frozen beans in my Breville Barista Express or my Fellow Ode gen 1, and not surprisingly I've had much less issue with static compared to grinding room temperature beans in the same grinders.
Man, this video is surreal. I don't think I ever had a chance to meet him specifically, but I was just at a small conference with Chris Hendon a few months ago and met several of his students and heard a bit about his coffee research. I don't think I've ever seen someone I've encountered so closely in such a popular piece of media as this. I suspected that he or his work about coffee (though he also studies wine and other compounds more relevant to industrial chemistry) would show up here eventually though. Super exciting stuff!
I am SUPER excited that you got a particle size analyzer, and from a legit analytical science company like Anton Paar. That is an incredible leap towards quantifying the impact of different grinders, burrs, grind RPM, etc, which so far has been limited to assumptions. Wow! That instrument is a significant investment too and I'm thrilled you got to a place where your fame and fortune, so to speak, can be put towards advanced coffee science to benefit all weird coffee people everywhere!

I'm assuming we'll be seeing a lot of grinder studies now using that instrument. Can't wait =)
I used this spritzing water method a few weeks back before this paper was published. My grinder is the new Fellow Opus. It was the first time I did it with the Opus because I never thought of doing it since the grinder has anti static tech. And I was so surprised that when wet, it took vastly much longer to reach 36g than when it’s dry. Now that this paper has been published, I’m going to try it again!
James, I would love if you could get a multimeter and measure the resistance of the various materials the griders are constructed from, particularly where the machines directly contact the ground coffee at the end of the grind. My theory is that more conductive surfaces like metals will better dissipate the charges than plastic insulators. I think this likely accounts for that initial difference you noticed between different grinders -- the Eureka Mignon Oro has a metal spout and cup.
I just tried spritzing for pour over coffee. There was less static cling, which was nice. I also noticed that the water drained through the coffee grounds a bit slower. I only did it once so it could be a fluke.
Well done Chris and his fellow authors as well as you James. What shocks me is that there isn't more science on how to improve the taste of coffee. Probably because the perception of taste is subjectively measured rather than objectively. But there seems to be so much scope to improve brewing and roasting techniques.
Just a simple thank you James for all you do. Endlessly fascinating to me, and rewarding every time I make my coffee.",24,Entertainment,1930000,PT19M37S

Whether people love or hate him, that promo was a masterclass in putting yourself and others over and making a crowd want to pay to watch you wrestle every person you mentioned, you feel like he meant every word.
Nothing about CM Punk ever feels forced or contrived, which is so hard to do when cutting wrestling promos. He is so good for wrestling, regardless of the drama that surrounds him.
The fact that Punk can use LA Knight's chant made my jaw drop. CM Punk doesnt break the 4th wall, he destroys it.
His tone, his movement, his words, his interaction with the audience, everything is storytelling everything feels real.
I was at Survivor Series and I still get the chills when this man’s music hits!!!!
Every time his theme song hits the crowd goes absolutely insane, I put my headphones on, just to feel the reaction of the audience, it’s truly incredible
Whether you love him or hate him CM Punk knows how to get a crowd going. 
His mic skills are off the charts and he never misses a beat.
This segment was way better than the one he did on RAW. This is the CM Punk we all needed.
Incredible crowd management and mic skills. It seemed as if he had never stopped wrestling.
CM Punk Promo skills are off the charts and almost second to none. His promo skills are on par with top stars like The Rock. You may hate him but we got to give him credit that he actually got the guts to fight in the octagon. He don't even need a catchphrase or someone to interact with to move the crowd. In addition he doesn't makes you feel the promo was heavily scripted and that's next level promo guys
Was actually one of the soldiers there they showed for about a sec. Doesn't do justice how insane people went to see CM Punk. Every word he said we hung on to. Great night that Night
Like it or not CM Punk is the biggest draw everywhere he goes. I don’t care who your favorite superstar is. This man is the reason that even more people are going to watch and even come back to watching WWE now. The incline started with Cody, continued with Jade and still continues with Punk. WWE was, is and always will remain the best in the world.👍🏼👍🏼🔥🔥
He understands the point of Pro  Wrestling more then a lot of wrestlers do. It’s entire point is to get people to pay money to watch it, not to do 450 splashes through flaming tables.
I absolutely love the fact he is about to headline mania. Something that 10 years ago he felt entitled to. It took a stint in the ufc, a stint in silence, the creation of a new wrestling company and the subsequent mismanagement of said company to bring him full circle. Life is crazy.
Never been a fan of Punk but as he physically alluded, he absolutely knocked that promo out of the park. Got me excited about several different storyline possibilities with call outs, some direct and others subliminal. Expert level stuff.
Crazy how he’s levels above everyone of this era in charisma and MIC work. That promo was all time
Ladies and gentleman, we’re watching the Freddie Mercury of pro wrestling. Absolute master on the mic that controls the crowd like no other can. One of the best promos we’ve seen in a very long time. What a time to be a wrestling fan!
Seeing Punk back just feels right!   I hope him and Cena can have one final match before one of them retires.  ❤
I wasn't watching during his original run but it's great to see him back in WWE, he's instantly created such a big buzz and he's back where he belongs!",17,Sports,98500000,PT12M6S

She wanna ride with the star

I guess we both going to Mars, ok
I cannot forget the base
I’m taking my mop on my dates, ok
Just look at the look on they faces
They wanna jump in my place, ok
Told shorty she was the one
But I’m taking her friends out to Tan, ok
I told ‘em to load up the dock
But they wanna ride in my Benz, ok
One of one this a new Cullinan
No telling when I’m a stand, ok
Ain’t counting no more dubs again
Only fucking with the Benjamin’s, ok

Straight off of plane to these racks
We gon’ stunt to the vibes
And we gon’ keep it going let’s go
I through a fit in Rick Owens, ok
Momma the shit and she know how she be
Ain’t just talking I got it for sure I don’t play
Send a boarding pass when she get bored, come play
Come hop in the Urus we touring you
Keep it low they know that it’s roaring
Went ceramic the Audemar blue 6v
They ain’t brought em out yet these the new ones
Having motion don’t ask what I’m doing
Tryna see if she pretty she going
Haters hate, that’s their job they gonna do it
I wear white Air Force Ones the Louie
Tell a bitch she fumble she blew it
Bro ain’t do it if the lawyer don’t prove it
She delusional making up shit in her head and believing it

She wanna ride with the star

No telling when I’m a stand, ok
Ain’t counting no more dubs again
Only fucking with the Benjamin’s, ok

Made 100 mill and took over the street
With no sponsor man
Coming through customs
Flying through cali
They checking the jet for the contraband
Brought out the coupe
Shorty got grouped out
Told lil bitch to stay off the Gram
Don’t be the first to get hit with that drako
Soulja boy or that Aubrey Graham, don’t be playing
She holla at the moon I be barking
I am a goon she a goblin
Coke Boy like loon up in Harlem
Ramadan but we ain’t starving
Came out the mud on my own
That’s word to Rick I don’t owe ‘em
Shoot your shooter out his zone
So rich they think I got clone

Simons radiant kindness never fails to spread my cheeks
13 hours of nonstop arcade games +2.5k is crazy for a PS5 😭😭
Such a wholesome ending to the video, and people consider Simon the meanest Sidemen, that's just crazy.
Props to you Simon, giving N'Diyo that PS5 really made me tear up.
He may have spent 4x the cost of a PS5 😅but he also just made someone's Christmas. Well done Simon.
This video just made my day! Such a cute ending and a happy one for the gentleman who stayed behind for you. Goes to show how much you really spend at the arcades, but it's the memories that makes it worth it.
finally a vid that is upto simons standards , w concept
John needs a raise, the camerawork is 🔥
Such a W video, and that ending was the icing on the cake. 

I believe if you do good, good things comes to you, maybe that’s part of the reason why are you blessed. And honestly happy for you.
Not even caring about his own satisfaction. That's a solid dad out there doing his best. My pockets are so empty trying to put smiles on my kids faces for Christmas too. I'd have it no other way.
In his usual week, Simon films a Sidemen Video, Moresidemen videos, SidemenReacts Videos and a gaming video daily and he still takes time outside ALL of this to produce content for all of us, truly underappreciated.
if this was longer this would have been sidemen sunday level
Just another reason to love Simon he's the guy who can never let you down
That’s really sweet/ wholesome, I’m happy for the man’s kids. That was a wonderful way to end the video. W for Simon in the end ❤
Love this! You have just given that kid an incredible christmas but more importantly, you've undoubtedly made an even stronger relationship between him and his daughter. A small gesture for you can be a massive gesture for others 👏
After a few minutes I thought to myself ""I'm gonna have to slog it out to watch through the whole video cause Simon's a real one!"" But it was actually more enjoyable than I had presumed

GOATED ending!
Hes already got the accolade for the most consistent YouTuber
And in my books he's earned the accolade for one of the most genuinely kind-hearted people that exist today.

A tierzoo death battle series is exactly what the world needed
This is an AWESOME turn for the channel! And they don't even always have to be death matches, they could be races to loot or securing an area. Team death matches would be a treat too!
The animation team did a fantastic job! And congrats on finally being able to release the pilot
As an animator myself, Ive got to give massive credit to your animation crew --- theyve done an insane job with styling these characters right and capturing their minor quirks and characteristics. Ive seen hollywood do far worse.

Props all-round -- Super keen to see more of these styles of videos!
As someone who loved watching The Most Extreme as a kid on Animal Planet, I appreciate all the effort you went through to capture the aesthetic perfectly. The only thing missing was the music used in the show.
Dang, the fight choreography was so good! All the animations looked like they were straight out of a nature documentary, but the cinematography made the fight feel engaging. The Cat noticing the raptor, the bluffing, the opportunistic grapple using its superior height by the raptor, the raptor evasion of the cat first neck bite attack, and and the desperate counterattack by the raptor to save its life were all high points.

Such good work!
I didn't realize that there was room for this channel to make such a huge leap in quality... being able to actually make the scenario you want to show is going to be incredible for the future of this style of content. Incredible work
The animation on this episode is exceptional! Kudos to Kuzim and WobblyWorks!
I've always said character animation was much more important than realistic textures to make a CG character believable, and I'd say this is proof of that
I love this so much!! As a big fan of the iconic ""Animal Face Off"" series back in the day, it's nice to see interesting ideas and concepts make a comeback. Awesome stuff as always!
The animations here are crazy cool -- hoping to see more in the future!
This channel has been great the whole time it’s existed, and the skill going into production has been increasing. Thanks for existing!
I'm a long-time fan of Kuzim's art, and it's so wonderful to see the work spotlighted on your channel!
Wow, such a good pilot! This gave me a nostalgic feel to those versus series on TV, but the animation and modeling gave it such a unique and cool vibe. Congratulations to the whole team.

I just missed your ""gaming guide"" style of writing. This one was professional, succinct and great, but the game references are such a good twist that would be a match made in heaven with this art direction.
Sadly I don’t think these videos will hit your normal view count, but please don’t stop making them. The series from this would be amazing and WILL blow up. Great job on the animation from your team.
At first I was a bit shocked by the drop in graphics quality, fearing they finally dropped the ball on Outside’s legendary graphics. But then I realized this is a user made mod made from scratch. Not bad at all! And a very interesting concept to make it all the more appealing! Would love to see more content in this mod.
2 years well spent, this is amazing!! Truly top tier content every single time. TierZoo just doesn't disappoint
The step up in animation is phenomenal! Can't wait to see what you do with it next.

Very cool video, fun to see the differences between normal lifesteal and the public one!
@rekrap2 Just wanted to let you know: since it seems you were trying to hide your coordinates you should probably also blurr the ""target block"" and ""target fluid"" on the bottom right since they show exact coords.
@rekrap2 Just letting you know, if you want to properly blur your coordinates, you also need to blur the ""chunk coordinates"" Which is coordinates measured in chunks instead of blocks... Edit: After trying to figure out if you gave info away, I have found that you did block it. Sorry.
Seeing Rek play lifesteal again is so much fun
Hey Rek, it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown over the past couple of years form EcoCraft to Life-steal then the race to 1M with parrot then to commentary, speed runs, Hoplite and so much other amazing content. Thank you so much for entertaining me over the years.

New ecosystems, new creatures, a mount that let's you glide from high falls, everything from this trailer brought me joy and I absolutely cannot wait for 2025 this was stellar.
SO EXCITED!!!  (づ｡◕‿◕｡)づ⭐
This is what I always wanted to see in monster hunter. Large flocks of animals, more ambiant mega-fauna and large monster types being able to be encountered in hunting packs.

It will feel a lot more like a massive ecosystem, can't wait to see what they cook up for us.
As a fiver, it really is a surreal experience to be here for the next generation of Monster Hunter. I am absolutely stoked to see what is in store for us
""I'll let it speak for itself"" is one of the best things you could say at a game announcement, you know that Monster Hunter is so iconic that players could immediately recognize it in seconds.
The amount of restraint they had by only showing us one new large monster (and Rath ofc) is actually stunning to me. Didn't think they had it in them.
Seeing the way the small monsters interact with the environment, as well as one another, has got me feeling the same giddiness I had seeing the Monster Hunter 4 test footage of mounting and climbing walls for the first time. This franchise is in my blood man!
One of my friends got me into MH back when World was announced. I played World/Iceborne and Rise/Sunbreak. 3000+ hours combined later, this has to be the most exciting announcement for me in such a long time. Here’s to hunting with everyone in 2025, let’s go!
Here's the most anticipated game for me until it comes out. Very hard to top it from my list. 
MHW have such a special place in my gamer heart.
THIS LOOKS AMAZING! It gives me very open worldish vibes! I would love to see monster hunter move more towards this style that really pushes the boundaries of a true hunting, exploring, and researching kinda vibe.
The little bit of soundtrack we get in this trailer is just so legitimately fantastic.
From that deep synth bass at the start which is then punctuated by some really nice synth arpegios underlying the rise into the orchestral parts kicking in. The synth stuff being used is really new to MH or at least it hasn't had a very large presence. They mainly kept to orchestration.

But all of that leading into what is very quickly becoming my favorite rendition of the proof of a heroesque leit motif that each game gets as a main theme.

Truly excited for this game and to hear more of its soundtrack.
MHW was my first introductory into the franchise. It became and still remains my favorite game ever. and I started at the base Nintendo system. This game just brought joy to my heart.
Love the little bit they showed here, the movement feels like a mix of Worlds more Methodical speed and Rises more open verticallity
I absolutely loved World's ecosystem simulation, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what they do with this game!
I thought you couldn't get better than the Palamutes... I was so wrong. Though the mount's different movement types kinda make me think of Koraidon and Miraidon- the Pokemon mounts from Scarlet and Violet. It's a great concept already and seeing it put to use so beautifully here is great. I love this creature and I want twelve of them.
Bro, when I was going into the Game Awards, I had the lowest of low expectations…but then a few game trailers came out actually got me quite interested…and then this came at the very last moment and stole the show for me. I am hyped beyond belief, even if 2025 is quite a long wait, I am more than willing to wait for this masterpiece to come soon!
I want them to bring back 16 person hubs. So much more lively for my 7-12 person groups. It felt more dynamic and was a lot of fun when we had that freedom in monster hunter world.
One of my friends got me into monster hunter. My first game was world and i have been absolutely loving this franchise ever since. Cant wait to see what the new game brings ❤
I'm reaching that phase in my life where i really don't feel like investing so much time and energy into gaming but monster hunter completely overrules that thought...so damn excited :)",20,Gaming,435000,PT1M31S

It's great to see a normal person showing us how she feels. The gesture sends a strong message to the viewers if it reached them.
Don't mess with the staff, they got the last laugh 😂
At least she has a sense of humour. And a rebellious spirit.
Love how she went from genuine to newsreader face in an instant. Did anyone notice the slight raise of the eyebrow? Sassy 👌

God, that last shot of Aerith praying as black feathers fall around her is reopening old wounds.
Cid's voice sounds great! Can't wait to see more of him in this game
The thing I'm looking forward to the most is the Dyne plot line. It seems like they are diving deeper into his character this time around, and barret was already so good in Remake.
This game is literally the only reason I’m going to buy a ps5. In the original, Midgar just feels like a prologue to the actual game. I can’t wait to see how this one compares to that feeling when the world opens up and the game becomes that cozy warm blanket with a side of horror.
Aerith's new white dress is so pretty! Did anyone else notice that it was decorated with the same yellow flowers she grows in the cathedral?
So excited for this game!!!
Props to Loren Alfred for singing with her beautiful voice before the release of the game. truly magnificent ❤❤🤩
So niceeeeee!! Cid and Vincent in the party, Cloud and Aerith, Barret's story...the Gold Saucer!!! and Marlene there with Cloud and Zack, so insane!! looking forward to playing the second part!
Im emotional already... who knew the impact and trauma FFVII would cause a whole generation
Cid was one of my favorite characters in the original FF7, can't wait to play as him again in this remake.
I love Aerith so much, I teared up. Beautiful song ❤
I love Dyne's voice. Well, everyone looks amazing!
Oh my gosh, Cloud and Aerith just two inches away from each other ❤❤❤❤
I still have Phantom Pain from 26 years ago..... That last shot opened my wounds again for like the 7777th Time
This is going to be the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers.  And I don't think it's going to end the way we suspect.  It won't be smiles and rainbows, but I don't think Aerith is going to die, either.  If she did, then it would beg the question of what this was all for.  We know this isn't a true remake, but a sequel to the original game.  (The true remake is Ever Crisis.)
Quite possibly the greatest game ever made
I nearly shed a tear seeing this trailer... I'm not ready for this, I just want to see these characters I grew up with have a happy ending. But I know the journey of Rebirth won't be an easy one... Final Fantasy for Life!
Nobuo Uematsu is truly a legend. He just knows how to make music fit the themes of Final Fantasy games so well. Can't have Final Fantasy without Nobuo you just can't. This song may possibly be the signature theme of FFVII games from now on. The ending for FF VII is definitely gona be 10x more emotional with this. I'm looking forward to when that day comes.
Just when I thought my hype couldn't get any bigger! I haven't even played this game yet and I can already tell it's going to be one of my favorite games of all time.
One of my favorite trailers ever this is gonna be a masterpiece",20,Gaming,172000,PT2M37S

Lyrics:
I was missin in action like Chrisean tooth Back letting loose like a nigga had to point Imma god in Memphis who bigger than me The shit that they did I did at 16
He flexing his money we know that he broke Dick in her mouth NLE throat coat
He pressed bout a girl that’s fucking the city He tender we call him diddy
Choppa so big knock the weight off biggie I’m some like pussy this shit a get sticky Got me in that mode ion plan on glitching I’m back, nigga like I had an addiction
Dropped him Lego
He couldn’t take those Switches and dracos Shooters on payroll
Nigga don’t won’t no smoke they snoop dog We show up to yo door like uhaul
Lil nigga with a pistol stand tall
Quick to pop a nigga ass like a Adderall
Shaking the spot like a ass or some
Lil bruh sped he crash for none
Walk out the house with a mask and gun Better hold yo breath like a asthma pump
I move like the pope
100 some shots inna ghost
Better think twice don’t approach No regular Glocks
Know that it came with a box
We stepping like shoes and socks
One of the realest how can you not mention we slid out a civic now rolls Royce whippin She sucking and spitting double jerking twisting killing my kids like abortion clinics
Take some from who he line man
Nigga don’t feel like dying man
Cook em like grease in a frying pan
We don kilt mo niggas then the klansman
Kkk got ks on ks wanna fuck Kim k and make Kanye watch
Aye bay bay in the club with a drake gen 5 Glock Going down like joc
100 shots inna whip it was shot o’clock
He can run from Nigga but not from this Glock Don’t ask me if it’s one up top
That’s like asking Floyd Mayweather do he box
Walk down on his cat
9 lives he cap
Put his head in his lap we dicked em
Make the choppa clap
Make it sound like a rapper Imma hit this bitch with a rhyme
My dog sick em
Condition critical
Suspect nigga weon never been a victim 7.62 trip em
If I don’t got em tevo a get em
I might just O fuck that percs killing Slow fuck that, if I see his hoe Fuck That, last shotta flow fuck that

Sales from merch will support all life members who opted in.",2912,"""The leaves are all pointing upwards"" is a killer quote
Etho unknowingly roasting Jimmy while he's listening is just pure comedic perfection. XD
the cutoff immediately when Martin says ""When is that ender pearl gonna-"" is golden
I think Jimmy confused ""Guardian Angel"" with ""Intrusive Thoughts Personified""
Joel's ""For the Bad Boys"" hurts way more when you consider that he didn't know Jimmy was there. It was like a moment of them all working together again in a weird little way. My heart.
Grian, Cleo and Etho are like the most wholesome trio that Grian had in the entire life series hhahahaha i love it. Doing that zombie dance without hesitation hahaha
I love how ""The leaves are all pointing upwards."" somehow manages to sound so menacing, even though it means absolutely nothing.
gem's little ""yes!"" when they said the berry bushes got them was so cute. The reds this season aren't even scary, they're adorable
Etho and Cleo simply not reacting to Grians stranger-than-normal behaviour is so based. They got this.
what i've realized from this video is that Jimmy has a brain made for content. Like the amount of things he did that made this video so many levels of entertaining is genius.
them having tasks for the people who died early so they still have fun/content is actually so cute
I’m super appreciative of the fact that the captions in this video are different colors depending on who is talking. Thank you!!
Now I _kinda_ wanna see an SMP where everyone has a secret spectator buddy
Etho and Cleo listening to Grians weird requests and not thinking or asking twice before doing them for him... perfect.
JIMMY’S REACTION TO ETHO’S CASUAL REACTION TO “IT’SA ME” WAS SO FUNNY
Timmy is forgetting that everyone just embraces the weirdness in this series after 8 episodes
The curse of Timmy is contagious. He guides Grian and Grian loses so many hearts, turns red and loses even more hearts!
Crazy how I watched 11 other perspectives and didn't think for a minute that Grian was acting weird
The “for the bad boys” was timed real well with the fact that Timmy is guiding Grian
Ghosts coming back to give information would be very cool for the next series. Being attached to a specific player when you die to haunt them or guard them would be amazing.",20,Gaming,8360000,PT32M51S

Just realized Paimon would make an amazing camera person if she could keep her hands steady.  She’s basically a drone.
I just hope furina gets the well deserved hug. That she didn't receive.
Would be so cool if Navia used her gunbrella instead of the glider  😭
Furina as a director is such a sweet resolution still pursuing the art of theatre but not in the spotlight as she wished. Love that for her.
Rip Meluse and Silver. Went out as heroes even beyond the grave. Rest well. 🫡
Teleporting right to the ""key"" in domains is going to be a MASSIVE time saver. I can't even count how many hundreds of times I did the sprint along the entrance stairs.
I love it when Sarah hosts the special programs.
Fontaine enabling a non-hydro related reaction with Chevreuse is really an unexpected move
You know historically both France and Japan have had influence each other in some point in time (especially artistically), so seeing Inazuma chars in Fontaine, doesn't surprise me in the least lol.

Out of all the news shared, I’m definitely hyped that we finally get to grace our ears with Wanderer’s theme with Stellar Moments Vol.4 outside of his character demo and covers.

ABOUT WIRED
WIRED is where tomorrow is realized. Through thought-provoking stories and videos, WIRED explores the future of business, innovation, and culture.",926,"Thanks again, Wired. More collabs in 2024? 👀
Playing against Stockfish is like competing in arm wrestling against an industrial press, basically.
Stockfish never fails to put Levy in a video
This guy should make his own YouTube channel about chess
Stockfish be like: You missed mate in 54? You filthy casual, my suggested move is to never play chess again.
It took him 34 moves to lose to Stockfish? I could do it much faster than that.
@GothamChess @Wired - thank you for having me on to talk about computer chess!  It's been one of my passions for a long time, and it was so much fun to discuss with you.
So basically the answer to every single question is that Stockfish just analyzes almost every imaginable position lol
I know he is an IM, but surviving 35 moves against Stockfish is seriously impressive. I wish I can survive 35 against my 1000 elo opponents.
I love how GMs don't even get on this. All the less incentive to be one when you're more influential than most GMs. Props Gotham
Just wait until they hear about Mittens
I don't even see the opponents bishop on the opposite side of the diagonal, let alone seeing 2-3 moves into the future
Levy: [builds a YouTube career roasting 500 rated bozos]
Stockfish: [exists]
Levy: ""Turns out the bozo was me all along""

Loving the Gotham<>WIRED collabs!
I love when Levy appears in a video he didn't upload because the title and thumbnail actually tells you what to expect.
This video is so good on so many levels. It's one thing to discuss the capability of a computer. It's another thing to be able explain to the common person why this computer is so good and to make the whole explanation so interesting. Add Levy's humor and his ability to explain things very well, mix that with all that the Wired editorial staff can bring to the table, and it's just wow. This content is just friggin awesome. Thanks, all involved!
Human: *performs opening move*

Stockfish: “after considering half a billion possibilities in a million different realities, I will play knight to F6 🤓”
To think, there was a time when we thought it would be impossible to ever teach a computer to play chess competitively against people.  Until Deep Blue beat the best of us.
The fact Alpha Zero made Stockfish look silly after only 4 hours of learning chess by playing against itself is both fascinating and scary at the same time.
Levy's so good they can bring him on to interview someone else and the video is still awesome.
as someone who's very interested in the world of machine learning (and has looked into how stockfish works), its cool seeing a video covering the fundamental concepts like this. i hope we get more videos like this",24,Entertainment,10800000,PT9M54S

can all of us Jack-Offs agree that jack puts so much effort into his videos?
Jack's A/B testing thumnbails on this video too :)
Love the new content, Jack! I’ve been watching since 2020, and it’s great to see how much you’ve grown! ❤🎉
Jack is by far the most underrated youtuber on the platform!
I love how Jack changed the title because he realized that 900% more isn't 900 times more lol
Alternate title: Jack shows off his Photoshop skills for 7 minutes
Jack's content is always so fun to watch, Im proud to be a Jack-Off
6:07 love how jack somehow made jawed’s name into javed
Спасибо большое за старания ❤
Jack always comes up with the best ways to get a good video out
I am so amazed how far you’ve grown Jack. I am thrilled how your main channel has reached 4m subs and hopefully even further🥳 keep up the good work it all pays off
Absolutely love these analytical and experimental videos! Also your 49 on trending right now jack!!!!
I wanna know whether the algorithm pushes it bc of the update, or whether the improvement in the thumbnail is doing the work. You could worsen some thumbnails to see what's going on here. Love your stuff, Jack!
This video is a perfect example of a classic cool and entertaining jsal video, I love it ❤
Jack always manages to be more creative with everyone else
do a part 2 but instead of only changing 5, you change perhaps hundreds and see how that impacts your whole channel, it would be so crazy to see your channel get 2x or even more views just by changing title and thumbnails
after watching this video i was inspired to edit up some of my oldish thumbnails! thank you in advance jack! <3
This was so interesting to watch, might have to look into it more 👀great stuff Jack!",24,Entertainment,4220000,PT13M44S

Legendary.
Tyler and Bogdan definitely had the best hiding spots. They endured siting/standing in a wall and floor for 3 hours.
JT fan favourite? The insulation was the best hiding spot in my opinion though, especially when James said how disgusting that would be. Like what's coming next year, hiding in the septic tank?
JT hiding in plain sight was awesome
Funniest has to be JT and Andreas hiding in plain sight in the office while James goofed around with his card trick, but Tyler and Bogdan had the best hiding spots for sure. Hard to pick between the 2 though
Wow! Lots of good hiding spots this year!

It's be a shame if someone secretly spent all year digging a hole with a trapdoor somewhere to hide in...
Honestly, Tyler made probably the cleanest and most invisible spot of all. Bogden was in a cut wall so had some form of opening, but Tyler's had absolutely no telling that it was altered and looked like perfectly normal floor tile.
I’m surprised that so many hid from a thermal camera and left little to no clues on where they hid. I was most impressed with JT hiding in plain sight and how long he pulled it off with eyes on him so frequently.
Someone needs to incorporate a hiding spot in a project and sit on it for 6 months just to win next year.
If the Hacksmith Industries ever move to another building, the next occupant will find an unusual amount of hidey holes and secret passages throughout the entire property.
The insulation hiding spot was 200iq. When James pulled out the thermal camera, I thought “he is not going to find that person with the camera”.
I love how much team work they put in, and I love how often James walked past some people in plain sight lol
JT hiding was the best I've ever seen. Dude was just sitting there like nobody's business while James was running around. Legendary.
I really wish other companies understood the importance of this kind of team building. This is the kind of stuff that makes memories and employees will be talking about at future jobs about how they used to work for the coolest company ever.
JT's hiding spot deserves commendation, James was stood next to him and had no goddamn idea
This looks like so much fun! Despite the high-pressure work environment and the demands of producing YouTube content while simultaneously designing and building some of the coolest tech, y'all still manage to bring your A game to hide-and-seek. Great job!
JT hiding right in front James at the desk was by far the best, even though he got caught eventually.
I feel like someone who wants to win this should plan super far ahead... build a spot early in the year so that people get used to seeing whatever changes are made to the surroundings...
If I had a nickel for every time I saw a YouTube based company playing hide and seek with their employees, I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened right
JT keeping his cool with James leaning over his shoulder was _absolutely_ the best! That said, Tyler's hole in the floor was prolly the most effective spot.",28,Science & Technology,14300000,PT21M1S
GB,C3iHAgwIYtI,Starship | Second Flight Test,SpaceX,2023-12-07T18:10:15Z,,1014547,50668,"On November 18, 2023, Starship successfully lifted off at 7:02 a.m. CT from Starbase on its second integrated flight test. 

While it didn’t happen in a lab or on a test stand, it was absolutely a test. What we did with this second flight will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing Starship. 

The test achieved a number of major milestones, helping us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary. The team at Starbase is already working final preparations on the vehicles slated for use in Starship’s third flight test. 

Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting second flight test of Starship!

Follow us on X.com/SpaceX for continued updates on Starship's progress",2431,"We need these streams back on YouTube, I need to see this on a large display.
So great seeing all 33 Raptor engines staying lit during the entire Stage 1 ascent, excellent work!
I REALLY hope you start showing the Spacex launches on YouTube again, their are many many people who don't do social media and miss watching all the Falcon launches and updates.
Great work to all at Spacex as always.
Excited to see SpaceX making history in our lifetimes(:
I’m 67, and I remember the space program from Mercury through Apollo. They used to wheel a TV into the classrooms so we could watch…you can’t imagine how thrilled I am to see this happening! SpaceX is just running away with the ball, so happy for everyone on the project 🙌
I love this!
Please bring back live launches to YouTube, or make a smart TV app for X so we can watch it on a big screen instead of our phone.
This is a spectacular feat of human ingenuity and co-operation, long live the entire team at SpaceX! 👏
The length of the flame plume is completely insane. Starship fully stacked is like the same height as a 30 story building, but then the flame plume spits out to more than twice its height, the plume and starship combined probably are almost 100 stories tall
It looks almost like an animation, the performance of those 33 Raptor engines was flawless 😊
It was an unforgettable and wonderful moment in my life. Thank you SpaceX team!
1:06 The shutdown of the engines, in a ring, from the outside to the inside!! Pure exhibitionism from Spacex!! A true spectacle!!
Inspiring, Mom always told me “shoot for the stars because you’ll land on the moon” I always think about it when I look up, Thank you guys for always pushing yourselves, it reminds me to do the same
It's amazing how close the shot at 0:53 looks to prior renders of Starship, both by SpaceX and by fans
The way the first stage engines shut down in sequence is awesome! Well done SpaceX.
just breathtaking what big steps are being made by the SpaceX team! <3
Go for it!
This gave me goosebumps! I feel so lucky to be alive at such an important time and be able to see this incredible company grab humanity by the scruff of the neck and drag it into the future! Thankyou SpaceX ❤
Impressive epic view of liftoff. The visuals from SpaceX have always been at or even exceeded their rocket tech.   Looks like SpaceX is rapidly approaching the threshold of repeatable orbital flight with these vehicles!
Compared to the first test flight, this one was like night and day. Bravo, SpaceX crew! IFT 3
Это было потрясающе! Ждём с нетерпением тест 3!
The emotion of being able to watch and follow the entire preparation and launch of Starship is something spectacular, wonderful, unique, with all my heart, congratulations to everyone involved in this incredible mission, unsurpassable SpaceX...",28,Science & Technology,6600000,PT1M55S

I lost my wife earlier this year. She would have loved this song. I shed tears of somberness and loneliness this Christmas. Thank you for releasing this song Simon.
XG is one of those rare groups where you can see and hear how each member is trained & honed to their fullest capabilities which led them to pulling off every single concept they take on effortlessly.
What an instant bop for this season!
XG brings soul back in music. They sing with their heart. Every word they say, every note they sing, every choreo, there are soulful sincere message in it. I hope they keep on doing what they doing. They are making the right choice. There are a lot of us who understand real music, talented artists. We’ve been waiting for a group like you our whole life. The fanbase keeps getting bigger. I saw new reactors everyday. They been saying you are their favorite group. So.. keep going! XG HESONO OOOOO!!!!
They really need to play this on radio in all over the US.
My great grandpa passed away in October. Its been really hard for me, and this song in a way made it easier for me to accept the fact that he wont be with us this Christmas. Thanks, XG, for your amazing new song. 🖤
I wish XG would release a full length album with 13-14 songs before the world tour so we can get lengthy concerts🙏🤞
The gals need some radio play for this song.. it’s such a good song and deserves more people to know before Christmas
Toda vez que escuto novamente, meu coração vibra de uma maneira diferente! OBRIGADA XG 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I lost my mom this year. This song made me think of her since she loved Christmas ❤
The more i listened to the song the more it hit harder. Also the comments section made me realize and remember why i never celebrated Christmas for so long. Because when my dad passed away our family stop doing that. This song was so meaningful, thank you XG, XGALX, the creators behind it so much. For making me remember one of my happiest time when i was young 🩵🤍❄️ And yes if i can tell my dad i want to tell him not to worry bc i have a good life 🩵🩵🩵
こんなに奮い立たせるような冬ソングは今まであっただろうか…

全員がエモい。誰を推すとかじゃなくて、全員ステキすぎる
It's sad how underrated this group is.
They slayed every genre..
Not only noisy music and dances
Coco's voice so warm and smooth,  I can listen to her forever. 
Juria's make me emotional.
Maya's and Hinata's voices are so pretty. I'm happy they did a lot of singing here.
Chisa always killing it.
Jurin's and Harvey's parts are mellow but so impactful at the same time.

Love them sooo sooo much
I really want to meet the person who produces/writes their stuff. It is SO authentically American 90s to early 2000s R&B it's crazy!!! Kpop often chases black culture awkwardly, but these girls TRULY pay so much hommage to it in SUCH an authentic way!! It's so amazingly beautiful! Also, Harvey...that outfit at 3:33 - I can't, girl stop...please, my heart 😍😍😍
The beauty of the song, the amazing vocals, the rap production, the beautiful harmonies, everything is perfect.
This song deserves more attention, Xg is such a talented group they’re better than the most of popular groups.
XG is slowly dominating the world. Really hoping for a live performance.
That melody is angelic OMG ✨. Maya’s part surprised me in such a good way, I love that I discover new talents from the members with every new release.",10,Music,2400000,PT4M11S

Can’t wait for the Batman boss fight even if we don’t stand a chance against him
Batman: ""You think you're a team now?"" 

Loved to hear Kevin Conroy's voice once again! R.I.P
Initial news about this game has given me doubts. But I can’t deny that the trailer looks amazing and using Gorillaz for the music was unexpected, but very welcomed
0:59 Hearing Conroy’s voice again gets me so emotional. I can’t wait to see his final iconic performance as the dark knight, RIP.❤️
As a Gorrilaz and A DC fan I will never feel more satisfied in my life.
I don't know what's scarier!!!!!!! Batman with a gun or Batman with fear toxin?!?!?!?!😨🤯
The game looks amazing! One final ride for Kevin Conroy’s Batman ❤
From a story and cinematic aspect this game looks incredible. Can't say the same for the gameplay. But I'm definitely interested in the campaign.
Love how some parts of the music sound similar to the Flash's (CW) theme.
I know it probably won’t happen, but I really hope we get aquaman DLC.  Shazam and MM might be too similar to Superman but imagine having a boss arena in Atlantis where you have to fight aquaman while holding off sea monsters!
""Time for us bad guys to save the world""--- Every badass anti-hero
The boss battles look amazing especially the one with the Flash. Also gotta love the design for the Fear Toxin using Batman
I thought I couldn't get more hyped for this game.
But seeing the boss fight's in the trailer, I NEED IT NOWWWWW!!!!!!!
Gorillaz and Suicide Squad. Two of my fave things I never thought would work so well together.
God, I can’t wait for this game. The green lantern boss fight looks absolutely sick, and this game has won my hype back.
Ok, you got me this time! I will give this a chance! ❤ Fantastic trailer and perfect music!
The gameplay doesn’t look stellar, but the story does. It’s cool that they brought in Nightmare Batman. Can’t wait to see how that plays out.
Gorillaz Clint Eastwood?!

Only Sega can show up with FIVE announcers in one go! *AND THEY ALL LOOK AWESOME!* Can't wait to play 'em, guys!
Now THIS is the SEGA we remember! These legends will never die.
That Sega scream at the end was the cream of the crop! Shows that Sega is back again and more badass than ever!!
The ""SEGA!"" at the end really tide it all nicely. Nice touch. Hopefully this means SEGA really coming back to it's arcade-y roots and feeling cool.
I am so PSYCHED to see a return for Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Shinobi!!! First Sonic is coming out with hit after hit, now it looks like Sega is bringing ALL the classics back! Let’s make it the year of Sega!
Good to see ya back to your true form, Sega. We missed ya.
To be this good takes AGES, to be this good takes SEGA! 💙
Crazy Taxi is such a great game as is to see it get fresh updated graphics, it looks so good. Can’t wait for this to come out.
I never thought I'd ever see a new jet set radio again... I am so damn happy! Sega remember you have a huge catalog use it!!!
You still got it, SEGA. Give these franchises the love they deserve, give us the quality we remember from the late 80s and 90s.
Literally one of my two favorite announcements that was made during TGA. WE ARE SO BACK.
So excited to see these announcements, thank you Sega for finally listening after all these years! This is something I thought I would never see, it's been so long. I'll for sure be purchasing each game, physical special edition! So many great memories of wonderful and creative Sega games in the past that I loved. Now... if only we can get a real new modern Sega console released before I die, would be the cherry on top!
This is insane! I was waiting so many years for a proper continuation of these classics! Soooo happy to see them return!
Holy guacamole! A new 2d shinobi?? That's one of my childhood dreams. I love all these games. It's about time Sega did something with them. They're very popular in the retro community
let me mark jet set radio off on my gaming bucket list.
sega, you're killing it with this art style.
SEGA, nunca saíste do meu coração! s2
I'm actually really glad that Sega has decided to bring back some of these older IPs from the 16 bit Genesis era Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Shinobi. Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi from the Dreamcast days is a great return as well. Sonic franchise though I've been a fan of the Blue Blur since I was a kid it definitely is time to put that franchise a rest for a while.
Absolutely a blast of nostalgia. Wishing all the best for the development of these titles
Dang. That's awesome. I'm very happy to see a well known game company prioritize their classic IP's and delivering new titles for them.

Congrats on reaching the finish line with this one. It looks great.
can't wait to see the FINALE to the P1 as well
Can’t wait to see this on the road once I’m back! Sounds amazing 😻
Doing a 6-speed gated manual conversion in a Scuderia is so sick 🔥
Amazing build! You and Matt Armstrong are my go to channels for rebuilds.
EAG is an EPIC company. The things they do with these conversions is amazing!!  And how fast he gets it done, unreal.
My heart skipped a beat listening to that engine sound, such a beautiful piece of engineering!
Freddy, watching you work on cars is such a joy! You can tell you’re having fun, and those of us watching really feel the same just like we were there in the garage with you. Keep up the great work, man! Kudos!
Freddie, you make a two year work look like a two week work with your simplicity. No stress at all in this two year build, you're always a delight to watch
So classy in white! I was sceptical about that manual conversion, but it works great. 
Congratulations on another top shelf build. Have to say, it’s awesome to see that no matter how big and successful your channel has become, you’re still the same guy, humble and just generally a good human being. Love the channel, you deserve every bit of success you get.
yeaah!!! Finally this video comes out! Been seeing the car in the background over the past two years in your videos slowly being put together! There's some videos in the past two years that occasionally shows Jack working on it too, and I've always wondered when a video on this car would come out! finally!! haha Just WELL DONE!
Awesome job Freddy, looks amazing. Love the centre locks and manual shift .... literally the best Scuderia in the world.
Such a satisfying video to watch, Freddy. Your content is always phenomenal and inspiring. Keep up the fantastic work buddy.
Dear Freddy, thank you so much for sharing this and all of them crazy builds you do 

It encourages me to think I can challenge myself, I can do it. 

Keep it up!
I absolutely love the F430 Scuderia. What a great job getting this one done with a gated manual and some nice touches with the race car parts. Awesome as always.
This is epic, you're a legend Freddy.  I don't even want Christmas lights, but I'll buy some if you just keep making stuff like this
I can only imagine how much it takes to do what you do,you’re an inspiration.Keep on wrenching every day 🔧
The Ferrari sounds amazing.  You have achieved and rebuilt an absolute supercar. It has been amazing following this build with you. Well done and thank you
So happy for you. It’s not about being the fastest, it’s about the experience, and this car is an experience without a doubt.",2,Autos & Vehicles,2750000,PT30M26S

LYRICS:
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Why don’t you just come over
You’ve been acting so cold
No I don’t want nothing crazy
Just wanna get you alone
And all of the snow is falling
I can make you fall too
So tell me whats on your wishlist
I want to make it come true
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can’t I be the one
To give you everything you want
I just want you to tell me that you feel the same
I don’t think I’m going to make it through the winter babe
Well don’t you want to wrap me up
And mistle touch under the tree
He won’t bring you somebody that loves you more than me
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I’ve been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away babe
Only I can do that
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can’t I be the one
To give you everything you want
You’re going to leave me all alone, on Christmas?
Baby, what’d I ever do to deserve all that?
Can’t we just like, snuggle?
Underneath the tree
By the fireplace
You know I make those cookies you like
Santa, doesn’t know you like I do
Well maybe this Christmas time
You’ll finally realize
That I could be the one
To give you everything you want

SHE CAN SING, ACT, DANCE....SHE REALLY CAN DO EVERYTHING!
She's feeding us with this holiday bop⭐
She's a triple threat, she can sing, act and dance. THE PRODUCTION AMAZING AND SUCH A HOLIDAY BOP 😍❤️
I'm so serious, this needs to become a Christmas classic. A beautiful sad Christmas song about wanting someone to notice you in time for the holidays that happens to be so true for so many people.
sabrina you're literally saving the music industry. you're literally a princess i just don't know how to say it. but thank you from the bottom of my heart.
""HE WON'T BRING YOU SOMEBODY, WHO LOVES YOU MORE THAN ME!!!"" wrote the lyrics brilliantly and her voice ❤
she really deserve global artist of the year 2024 let's keep on loving her by her entire being and her charismatic voice too guys let's do love her
She needs to win a Grammy ASAP 🤞🙌💓
I´m sure this will be a Christmas classic song forever. Thank you so much Sabrina.
I could go on and on with my praises for the lyricism but as far as the music video is concerned, it's so simple in the best way and I love it! It's cute, romantic, and lighthearted with definitely some undertones of nostalgia/regret. The video paired with the actual lyrics make you yearn for that special person, like you're missing someone either first-hand or second-hand (if you’ve never been in a relationship/onesided crush/situationship). I love this, THANKS SABRINA!! Merry Christmas ❤️❄️
I love that she’s releasing Christmas music, so versatile!!! It’s amazing and has so many og songs🙂
A química que eles exalam, a voz dela, a atuação, a vibe, o carisma deles, perfeito
Is it just me or does she give that 90's vibe we all need 😊. Love everything about her❤
the fact that all her videos are like movies . the creativity is unmatched . 💯her , her voice , perfect .
In my humble opinion, Sabrina is the hardest working and most under-appreciated female artist out there today.  AWESOME talent, as everyone else on here has pointed out.  And apparently has been more successful than some of the Disney alumni at keeping her head on straight.  I'm always anxious to see what she chooses to do next!
This song is pure magic! Sabrina's vocals are on point, and the music video is a visual treat. It's definitely going to be on my holiday playlist. 🎄✨
I swear this song is going to be a new Christmas classic. ❤

LYRICS 
Welcome to my problems
It’s not an invitation
This is my dilemma
And it’s my obsession

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

Welcome to my nightmare
Where dreams go to disappear
Sit around in rehab
Feeling like a lab rat

Strange days are here again
And it’s getting weirder
Here’s to all my problems
I just want to drink the poison

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

Oh, why
When I fall asleep tonight
On the wing
and prayer
Oh, why
For despair and obsession on you
You, yeah

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

I was sober now I’m drunk again
I’m in trouble and in love again
I don’t want to be a dead man walking
I don’t want to be a dead man walking

#GreenDay #Saviors #Dilemma",3473,"This song is so personal and from the heart. We are all proud of you Billie!
We just announced a MASSIVE tour 🌏 All the details you need for The Saviors Tour are on greenday.com/tour

New album ‘Saviors' out January 19th, 2024, pre-order it now https://greenday.lnk.to/saviors
This album feels like you just found an old Green Day song you never listened to and you're listening to it for the first time.
I’m proud of you, man. You were a father figure to me and did a lot for me when I was a kid, even if you didn’t know it. Your music saved my life. I’m glad you’re still breathing and were able to overcome the difficulties that you faced — much love, Billie!
Most authentic Green Day in a long while, this is a fantastic return
This is BY FAR my favorite single from this album so far. Feels like a return to form and I'm all here for it. Siked for the drop!
""Welcome to my nightmare, where dreams go to disappear"" 

Green Day still hits hard.
How do I explain this? THIS song feels like that one Green Day song I've been wanting so badly. The Pre-American Idiot song, that sounds like their old stuff, but new. American Idiot is amazing, and loved everything after that. But I've been missing the old sound, and this is mixed with new sound too. They nailed it.

I also hear a little Longshot in this too!
The best song they’ve released in at least 10 years
Absolutely phenomenal. Love the sound of every aspect of this song, instrumental and vocal. So on point! Excited for the rest of this album 🤤
This is probably one of my favorite music videos from them, it’s so simple but gets the message across
Thank you, Green Day. You guys and your music, are so dear to my heart. I am having some struggles with substance abuse- more specifically alcohol. You've inspired me Billie, to create a New Years resolution of quitting drinking, before it wrecks me. It won't be easy to keep it up. Next month, I'll be 27. I have Bipolar Disorder, and this is no way to heal. I appreciate you all so much.
Green Day and drop D tuning! Something I never thought I’d see but they’ve done it and I FUCKING LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
This band is amazing! 💚
No joke. This has to be the best song they’ve released since anything on American Idiot.

Mature themes. Gritty and powerful. Great lyrics, great melody and a very catchy chorus.

Gosh I love Green Day so much. Absolute banger! 💖
The more you listen to this song. The more you get into it.
This truly hits me. Fuck man. I lost the one I thought was going to be by my side forever.
man the new album is gonna be amazing <3
My mom recently passed away and on the same month they released their first songs from their new album. They have helped me a lot, but this song hits different. Being in a dark place and having some weird thoughts and Green Day shining a bright light on me through this song is what I needed. 😢❤ Thank you for a second chance.

#TCoFS #DbD",2926,"For people who are confused:

This is a brand new single player game set in the dbd universe, featuring as far as we know original characters (who will likely come to dbd as skins or characters in the future). This is made in collaboration with Supermassive games, who are known to be behind “Until Dawn”, “The Quarry”, and “The Dark Pictures Anthology”. This game will likely be in a style where the player makes choices that will alter the story. It will release sometime in 2024.

By the way, the song is “Daylight” by David Kushner
This game has gone so far it's insane
It actually looks SO good! More Dead by Daylight lore. I can't wait!
This could be Supermassive's best game since Until Dawn. Well done to both companies, I'm excited! 🎉 🥳
I love how his helmet is shaped like Entity's jaws, solid way to reveal more about the character through his design
Something about seeing ""from the world of Dead By Daylight"" with solemn music in the background is emotional. Like, for the past 7+ years, excitement around Dead by Daylight had always been about what outside thing they brought in, like license chapters. For the first time, hype is generated by someone else announcing that they are collaborating with Dead By Daylight. Im also so excited to be able to see Dead By Daylight in a more cinematic lense, finally being able to properly experience the horror of DBD
There’s a lot of symbolism in the name “The Casting Of Frank Stone” Frank Stoke being some form of character. Casting either being casted by the entity for what we know as “The Trials” or casting in terms of being shaped or molded by the entity. As well as casting and stone in the title could imply the saying “Casting the first stone” so this may very well be some form of beginning to the story we know, this may have been where the first stone of our story is casted.
I like how the killer already looks so unsure about what he wants to do and what he’s becoming and when he’s shown off in the mask it looks like he’s just exhausted and so regretful of whatever deal he made with the entity
You guys have NO IDEA how happy I am to see you two collab together! Can't wait for this game!
If they really want this to feel special, I hope we also get to make choices from the killer POV. Remember that most killers are as much victims of the entity as the survivors and want to escape this purgatory.
Some hunches I have about this game

1. This could possibly be the first killer that arrived in The Entities realm and tells the story about how he got there before being tossed into The Void
2. The screams in the background are most likely the four main characters being held captive by said killer who at some point during the game manage to escape and you have to help them make it out alive. 
3. The Entity's full physical form is seen for the first time, that being a gigantic spider. While it is said that the realm itself IS The Entity (ex. Trees, Birds, pallets etc) on the official DBD wiki it states that The Entities most preferred form is that of a Spider, resembling something from Stephen Kings IT. 
4. It's my strong hunch that whoever it is that is supposed to canonically survive the game will most likely show up as a future survivor in the core game. 

All in all I'm really excited for this game, can't wait to get my hands on it.

Edit: When I was looking at the steam page for the game, I also noticed a pharmaceutical store that had ""Afterpiece Tonic"" on it, so we'll probably get to meet a younger version of The Clown at some point? Or maybe a close relative that refers to him.

Edit 2: Did some thinking and I believe that we will experience the 4 main characters get taken by The Entity, which will result in them encountering Frank Stone and we will experience a full trial in a more cinematic perspective. This would explain why his workbench is covered in nature by the time the others show up. So before that happens, it’s really more so getting to know the towns history and the scars Frank left behind.
This is an infinitely more interesting collaboration than I thought it was going to be. Would be super fun to get some outfits or even chapters related to their other games
Felt a surprising amount of emotion from this trailer. Very well made!
You can see the reference from the song itself, Frank doesn't really want to kill but he's being forced by the entity.

""Hiding all of our sins from the daylight""  His eyes speaks from the sins he committed, such a powerful trailer indeed.
I’m crying seeing how far and how much dead by daylight has grown and I get a shot of nostalgia whenever I play this game
Finally expanding the DBD franchise in a way that makes the most sense. Not everyone likes 4v1’s. But a LOT of people like horror based story games. 

Imagine new characters or existing characters story fleshed out in an interactive way. 

THIS is a good sign.
this has to be one of my FAVORITE trailers you guys have made, the music, the animation its just great
For anyone wondering what the gameplay and chase sequences will be like:

Most of the game is cutscenes where you make choices that determine events that happen and who lives/dies. All action sequences during the game are also cutscenes with things like ""Quick Time Events"". For example, if you had to jump over a pallet to escape the killer in the game a buttom would appear on the screen. If you press the button before it vanishes you jump over the pallet, if you don't then the character is either permenantly dead or lives through luck somehow. The rest of the gameplay while not being chased will basically be 3rd person and you will just walk around through areas finding clues and trying to escape.

Also if you want more games like this check out Until Dawn, The Quarry, and the 4 games in the Dark Picture Anthology
This trailer is a masterpiece, this music and this camera optics.👍
Perfect music choice, i am so in. This has to be one of the best directed trailers for anything I have ever seen. Well done on both companies, you guys knocked it out of the park.",20,Gaming,1060000,PT1M46S

The fact that this is a whole new experience and is free, you really gotta give props to Epic and Lego for this, it’s actually insane
I honestly thought this was going to be just a fun little gimmick for Fortnite for a little while. But no, they clearly put a ton of love and effort into this. And the song choice was perfect for the trailer - made me nostalgic for the days I used to play with LEGOs as a kid.
Not a huge Fortnite fan, but the devs really put a lot of love and care into their updates. Wish other developers were the same.
Might be the best crossover so far
I love that this feels like a callback to the original design of fortnite being a horror survival by night and material base builder by day
I really hope that this is a permanent mode that gets more updates and love from the devs, this looks amazing!
This is legit what LEGO Worlds should have been!
This is pretty epic ngl. The effort and care they put into this is really outstanding!
This is what we needed. We needed a free roam no story Lego game. I’m super hyped to play when I get on!
I think everyone is truly underestimating the quality of this new game version. All the custom skins and animations they had to remake, and all the sounds and ideas. Truly we should thank the developers and not the ones telling them to make it. Thank you developers.
I dont think people understand how much effort this took. Honestly looks amazing.
As a massive lego and lego game fan as well as a fortnite enjoyer i gotta say. You guys knocked it outta the park and i love you for it i have been asking for a Lego survival for ages little did i know that Lego would not deliver but Epic would. Thank you for this!
I love how in the end they put ""adventure is building"". Is a great recall to ""the battle is building"" that appears during the first trailer of battle royale.
How is there zero paid content for this mode?? It's so insanely good and I was not expecting a completely new game. This was awesome!!
The fact that this is such a new experience and it's free that you actually have to give Epic and LEGO props for this is actually crazy
The music alone had me beyond hyped! 1:17 
I played it most of the day around classes and work and it was so much fun! I also got to play it with my friends this evening which just made the experience better!
After playing this mode for a few hours, it feels like a combination of LEGO Universe, Minecraft, and a touch of Fortnite. I love it
Honestly better than what I was expecting! Just spent the past 5 hours playing with my friends
Loving it so far. I'm happy this isn't a one off, but will continue to be developed over time.",22,People & Blogs,216000,PT2M3S

The panel kick-off the show with a Secret Santa draw. With Jill Scott already making her pick and absent from the episode, the five will return in a special Christmas episode with their secret gifts.

Gary and Jamie respond to Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s press conference quotes following Gary’s suggestion that City have become complacent and talk about how Arsenal are hitting the right form as they head into the festive fixtures.

Stick to Football also reacts to the latest off-field issues at Manchester United after former player Nemanja Matic revealed who and why team-mates were fined. Listen to how Gary, Ian, Jamie and Roy all dealt with club punishments during their professional career.

Super 6 is back with Ben; has Gary kept up his sizeable lead or has Roy managed to claw some ground back?

And we have your Community Questions. Find out the biggest sacrifice Gary had to make as a teenager who had just left school and which player made Ian’s introduction to football incredibly difficult.

------------------------------------------------------------------------",1999,"Ian Wright is a national treasure. His and Roy’s friendship is the best part of the whole show.
Truly respect Ian Wright for telling that Jim Cannon story. You can see the emotion, and it takes a lot of character and bravery to show your vulnerability in front of 800k subs. Also, Roy Keane showing why he's always been a Captain. The tap on the arm and saying, ""You got through it."" Top, top interaction.
Ian Wright is such a top bloke. I enjoy his friendship with Roy, and with that story at the end, Roy didn’t let it get laughed off or make a glib remark, he validated him. Every dressing room needed a Roy Keane
ian wright is a national treasure certified 🐐
The chemistry is off the charts. The editing too. Every episode seem to fly by.
Man that wrighty story at the end got me emotional. Can only imagine how he might of felt out of place or uncomfortable to start given his late professional start and to have someone treat him like that making him feel unwelcome. It's enough to make some players never recover, to have the career he did shows truly his mental strength and desire. Love you Ian the people's hero
Roy giving Ian pats of assurance and comfort is heartwarming to see. My captain!
Wright's gut feeling for Bournemouth should have been listened too 😂
Carra’s reply to Pep was tremendous 😂👏🏼
My respect for Wrighty has grown again...not easy to tell these stories (which Cannon denies doing)...Ian was named Palace player of century ahead of Cannon which I hope gave him some bit of joy
Damn!!! Wrighty telling the hard hitting story at the ending. No matter what profession your in, bullies are everywhere. Keep sharing these stroies as it makes people stand up and listen.
I love the friendship between Roy and Wrighty it's brilliant to watch. I seen a comment about Ian Wright being a national treasure, I couldn't agree more with it he really is a national treasure.
Roy patting Wrighty at the end! The sense of assurance he still provides, more like a captain in his playing days!! My captain, Keane!! Every dressing room needs a Roy Keane! ❤️
Don't normally comment on these podcasts but I have to say how much I love this 1 , 4 brilliant ex footballers and great to hear their stories and opinions, Wrighty's story about the bullying he had to put up with at Palace was great to hear and see how it affected him but didn't stop him from becoming 1 of arsenal greatest strikers,  fair play to him for telling that story and how much it affected him,  can't wait for the next one,  thank you all
The whole concept off the show is amazing. From bitter rivals to best friends. Could watch them for hours telling their stories amazing 👏
I love what Ian literally brings to the table. Great personality and top footballer in his day. Its a great video this, so much experience sat together.
50:14 Great shout from Wrighty.  Love the show with just these 4 legends 👍
I don't usually comment on Youtube videos but needed to say how good this show is! Please keep this lineup also, you 4 are a perfect mix!
This has got to be the best football podcast/programme out there. Powerful ending as well. Well done Wrighty!
These 4 are amazing together! Keep this series going for a long time please!!! 🙏🏼",17,Sports,847000,PT1H5M37S

یه شاستی بلند دلم میخواد راه که میره بلرزه زمین
کاش یه دونه سکسی بیاد هشتاد و پنج باشه همین
بگو آمین یا رب العالمین
بگو آمین یا رب العالمین

کاش یه ذره سفید برسه باهم دوتایی تا صبح بزنیم
دوتا باتل و خوردیم الان ایشاالله امشب بگا نریم
بگو آمین یا رب العالمین

من احمق، خر، ساده همش بگا میرم عین همساده
بیا تو جمع لب بده بهم عین نوید محمد زاده

آقامون جنتلمنه جنتلمنه

الان یه ماهه که آویزون فقط تو اینستای منه

حالا امشب واسه ما ناز میکنه این پلنگ درنده
جلو بقیه الکسیسه واسه ما الهام چرخنده
اووو لبو داد من نگاه به چاک دکمه رو باز کرد what the fuck
انقدر اینجا اوضاع خرابه یه فیلم میگیرم برا سالی تاک

کاش یه دونه سکسی بیاد هشتاد و پنج باشه همین
بگو آمین یا رب العالمین

بچه ها یه دست بزنین واسه خاله لیلا

I am Iranian and I also enjoy Indian songs very much. I believe that our mutual love for each other's songs is not a coincidence, as there are many similarities and shared values in Indian and Iranian culture and language.

Wow!  I love how each single is totally different from each other. I'm at at time in my listening life that the challenges stimulate me in a wonderful way.
Única e irrepetible, GUNS N ROSES Forever.
Sounds heavy and powerful, has a spooky vibe, i like it 🤘
It's different. Great addition to their catalog. The chorus is epic, something only GnR could pull off. There will never be another.
The lyrics are incredible. Hats off to Axl for being this brave. I mean it. Putting all of that into a song must have been unbelievably hard.
No generic boring rock song for radio and ""fans""
Axl staying true to himself and keep following his vision.

Great song
I love the lyrics so much, they're hard, a lot of people can feel what they mean and find themselves in them, myself included. I love you Guns N' Roses 💗
I don’t care what anybody says about these guys, they are still going strong. I saw them in October and they were absolutely awesome. I’m only in high school but they will always be my favourite.
There are rock bands and there is GUNS N' ROSES.  Legends... Living Legends!!
Música nova do Guns tem que ser comemorada sempre.
Música sombria, passa um pouco da vibe the garden, ficou foda. Quem tem sensibilidade sente a dor que tem nessa música
Really loving this, dark and brooding. Still my favourite band!
This song gives me goosebumps!  Especially, a crazy kind of vibe of walking alone in the rain near Bosphorus after a breakup, finding yourself in an exotic city: Istanbul!! That’s sick!
Superou minhas expectativas!
Presente universal para o Rock🎸👏👏👏
This is definitely one of the songs of all time
I am so impressed for this song,I think that GNR could makes a campaign against the childhood abusement,this lyric can help a lot of people that has suffered of abusement!!
Experimental, formidable, the pace is relentless but delicate and full of calm full of energy!!!

Turkish please don’t get carried away. Grizz was talking mad and then you had to follow in his steps. Next three games doesn’t win us the league but definitely sends out a statement
Arsenal's next 3:
Aston Villa (A)
Brighton (H)
Liverpool (A)

How many points? 🤔👇
Polestar Tobs earned the first ever reload, props for that 🔥👏
That was a cooking masterclass from Saeed. Then Grizz had to get in on the act and had me dying for a good 40 mins. This is big 6ix heritage where cooking’s are a thing of beauty 🔥🤣
Love how when Saeed started to run out of ammo blasting Chelsea, Grizz came in with some resupply like, ' there was a missed penalty in there as well yeaa bare missed chances'😂 said Gallagher's their best player 😂
This show was 10/10. That intro, Saeed cooking Matisse in a deep fryer, the top 3 rivalry at the top starting to simmer. Loved it
I look forward to this, the highlight of my week, Just chatting football I just finished my physiotherapy after a double leg break🙌🏾🙌🏾 car accident, my community man repping Liverpool

Edit:
1:08:00 and saeed did a saeed again
The artwork within that intro was so intricate. ST is a genius  with the edits. Appreciate this brudda for as long as you have him
Saeed is good in taking the banter but also giving it. 😁
Big up the lads for the late show. Quality content always 🔥
When Saeed is giddy, and United win, it’s honestly one of the most hilarious things to watch.. 😂
Been a really bad week for me this week but you guys have made me laugh. Both shows this week have put a smile on my face when I didn't think it possible, much appreciated.
I've always said MC aren't as great as they're made out to be. LP & Spurs showed everyone the last few yrs. When teams don't fear them & attack them they look beatable & will concede goals. But none of the other teams copied it, too many teams feared them, sat back expecting to get beat which made MC look better than they were.
Fantastic show guys as always love the content and the banter is always top 🔥👏
Nah man, I HAD to comment. We ain't seen Citeh struggling quite like this tbh, especially the way they were totally dominated by Villa. Fair play to Unai Emery. Man deserves RESPECT! 👏 Talking about the episode tho... yet another banger! This title race gonna be super lit! 🔥
LOVE the show guys. Top banter and top people! 
The intro, has to be one of the best so far, the Tobi part  ☠🤣🤣. Skull doing madness on these introes! Would love to maybe integrate facecams to see all of your reactions to seing the intro for the first time if possible 🤣 Love from Norway!🙌🏽👏🏽
I find it crazy how some Chelsea fans are doubting Poch after 4 months. Yes he has spent but he has also sold. A lot of those players are not his & Poch is a project manager so you have to give him time with building his own squad. 

Chelsea fans need to remember, this isn’t Roman anymore, sacking managers so quickly might not be so smart under these owners esp when you look at the lack of top managers out their now
The whole big 6 panel are absolute legends love these lads",24,Entertainment,48800,PT2H14M4S

hey guys, I admire your videos, but you should reconsider which sponsors you take, as Betterhelp has had its good share of controversies, including, but not limited to:
- Selling personal data of its users
- Predatory charging methods
- its workers being of questionable quality, with some of them being unlicensed psychologists and some reportedly just saying people to ""get over it""
Isn't BetterHelp the company that was found pressuring its vulnerable clients into giving up sensitive data, and then sharing that data with third parties illegally so bad that the FTC had to step in?
It has been brought to my attention that what I said is very much outdated info that is no longer true. To whoever might read this: please disregard this comment.




Original comment for context:

I always thought it was really annoying that here in Argentina the rules don't allow us to register "".ar"" domains, instead only "".com.ar"" and "".net.ar"" being available, because ""-ar"" is the most common ending for verbs in infinitive form in Spanish so it would be a goldmine of word play.
BetterHelp is a company that has many egregious practices that are detrimental to mental health support.
Given how crazy for the USA so many of my fellow stateside people are, it's kind of wild that there's not a patriotism-fueled rush to not just use but over-use the .us code
hi both, love the video but it's worth researching Better Help a bit more - they are notoriously sketchy, not only are they dodgy about whether therapists are vetted or not but also they have sold incredibly personal consumer data (lots of articles online about this recently because they were found guilty). There are also some great video essays about BH and how they aren't quite what they seem. just letting you know if it informs future decisions.
Actually 🤓 dot cat is not some random cat loving person's idea, it's the marker for Catalan speaking or Catalan related websites. That's why joke websites and cat related businesses often have the option to view the site in Catalan, as it's a requirement to keep using the .cat extension.
that youtubers still take betterhelp sponsorships after everything that happened is a damn shame
One funny thing I learned a few years ago, the French Antarctic Territories have their own domain (.tf) but it's mosrly used for websites centred around the video game Team Fortress 2. I'd never really thought there'd be an actual part of the world that was meant to be using it.
Fun fact: Before DNS domains were managed by one woman and her team, who'd create the hosts file, and then everyone just had to make sure they had the latest hosts-file
I think it's interesting to mention that some ""countries"" using an alphabet other than the Latin get a bonus ccTLD in their local alphabet. For example, in Greece, there are .gr and .ελ (although almost nobody uses .ελ, because it was recently added and people are used to .gr). Also, in the EU there are .ευ and .ею (the greek and cyrillic equivalents to .eu), beacuse official languages of the Union use these alphabets.
“The United States of America considers itself the Default country”
Truer words have not been spoken
I normally have to watch Map Men videos a few times, looking for those little extras they put in.

Even the Unfinished London videos were full of them.

Well played Jay, Mark and the rest of any team you have helping you.
I laughed so hard at the New Zealand having six flags on the whatismyflag website at the start. I really appreciate that our flag fiasco gets to be a joke on this channel because it was a joke when it happened as well. Anyway I still think the laser kiwi flag should've won.
As always, I found this to be quite an informative and entertaining video! I learned about _two_ islands today: Torquay is a small town on the coast of England, while the even smaller Tokelau (which surprisingly, I _have_ heard of) has (or had) the most popular internet country code... despite not even being a country, but part of New Zealand! 

Thanks for the video!
seriously the most entertaining/educational combination I know.  I suppose I can think of funnier people, but not many, and you guys make the weirdest stuff absolutely riveting. And very good for slightly modifying my overall worldview.
Hi guys, I just wanted to say that your show reminded me a lot of old Bill Nye and gave me a very strange nostalgia boost while I was laughing my head off. Thank you for the unexpected boost of nostalgia and you guys are awesome!",23,Comedy,1470000,PT11M14S

Kieran’s new character design mixed with the music was really well done
I'm excited to see the legendary pokemon as static encounters all around Paldea, hope they're not Shiny Locked and you can finally get Shiny Sword & Shield Legendaries.
1:52 I love how when the player character sends out Iono's magnemite, she sends the pokeball the way Iono does. thats a nice detail
Everyone is excited to see the return of more starters and legendary Pokemon, but I'm just glad we get to see more Larry!
Honestly, it feels like Teal Mask walked so that Indigo Disk could run. Looking forward to this one!
3:50 Not only am I glad Darkrai is getting the attention he deserves, but also challenging Dialga and Palkia with Darkrai is a nice reference to the 10th movie!
Yes!!! Blastoise’ 3D model is finally fixed. I’ve been wanting this for over 10 years. His face is sculpted proper, his cannons are the correct size, and his shell (white trim) is now sculpted properly! Ho-Oh’s new model also looks nice!
The fact that they focused on the tao trio specifically makes me extremely hopeful for a legends kyurem game soon
Terapagos has potential to be one of my favorite legendaries.  Not only does its lore look interesting, but we are finally getting the majestic minogame Pokemon that I’ve been wanting since Squirtle/Wartortle didn’t evolve into one!
Gen 9 isn't even over yet and I'm already nostalgic for it. And I've been a Pokemon fan since the beginning!
I’m so excited to go deeper into area zero like the crystal tree and hallways look really cool. Wonder if there will be hints to a civilization down there. The music that accompanies the trailer fits so well and adds a level of excitement.
I love the return of the teachers and the gym leaders, can we have the team star members back as well, love those guys
This DLC has been amazing so far! it’s been personally heartwarming to see familiar Pokémon return and have new places to explore!
I’m so freaking happy all the starters are coming back! Can’t wait to find a Popplio!
I don’t often comment on YouTube videos….But I’m extremely excited for this one. Get to bring back some of my favourite Pokémon I collected over the years to join me in this DLC. I’m also excited for new Pokémon to catch and explore this new area. Been playing since 2006 when I was 14. Amazing that how Pokémon games have come along the way!!!
I hope that the catch rate for Legendaries has been drastically increased surprised that they have not shown Paradox Entei and Paradox Terrakion
There's so much about this trailer that I'm really happy about! I am hyped, can't wait for this to come out!!!!
One thing I seriously hope about the legendaries is that they can be hunted cause that would be amazing! ❤️

And oh man, Keiran looks like he's changed quite a lot. I guess we'll have to see if there's a way to save him. But it looks like he's gone villain mode. Or maybs just angsty rival mode.

Still, it's gonna be exciting to get to see all the gym leaders again, and how the story is going to play out. I mean, getting all these new mystery gifts has been a pleasent surprise too. Never even expected them to pull off a Dialga and Palkia Tera raid. Much less give out a Darkrai, even though you can get one in Legends Arceus, or BDSP if you managed to the Member's Card last year.

Still, all these new things are amazing. 💜
I can’t wait for the indigo disk, everything I’ve seen  looks amazing. Especially the fact we can get old starters from previous games and the extra interactions with the gym leaders and old legendaries too ❤❤❤",20,Gaming,5550000,PT4M14S

ABOUT VANITY FAIR
Arts and entertainment, business and media, politics, and world affairs—Vanity Fair’s features and exclusive videos capture the people, places, and ideas that define modern culture.",806,"This is why musicians should only give interviews about their music, as opposed to the endless interviews about their personal life. I haven't seen Billie this animated and relaxed and happy during an interview in a long time
It’s so wild that Billie can just randomly sing things that she says are hard lol. She’s like “this is super hard” and then just does it perfectly
I love how Finneas is such a musical genius while billie sings so effortlessly. Such a perfect dynamic duo
I’m obsessed with how passionate they are about explaining everything. The little details they were sharing as if they’ve been waiting forever to tell us. It keeps me so interested in the video. Knowing that they love what they do.
this is the prime example that billie doesnt just whisper and use Autotune. she can sing for real and its AMAZING
I LOVE hearing billie and finneas talk about production. Unless you've produced or studied it in some way, you'll never know the full extent of what goes into production and I'm so glad they did this interview to show people that it's not just a few instruments and vocals, it's way more than that ❤
Billie's vocal is so angelic. I mean the way she sings that same lyric with different melodies is just so beautiful to hear.
they are legendary duo. they are gonna be in history pages as legends love them
Now I'm convinced that billie can sing anything at any style
Like the audacity to say ""it was hard"" the whole time, then randomly sings it perfectly😂
such a powerful duo in the music industry. their writing process is always so genuine and interesting to me. what was i made for is truly a heartfelt song. i love how they have so much fun with some songs they write but some of them they get down and serious. they know when there is a time and place to do both of those things during the process of making a song.
These two are definitely geniuses. Listen to how they talk about how they feel about music and how they write it
i feel like being in your 20's is like such a overwhelming thing where you ask yourself everyday who you are, what you are made for and what you're gonna do with your life. Seeing that billie who is such a phenomenon and a deeply talented person goes through the same thing is so wild and reassuring. I love them both so much and their music means so much to me. just loved it
I love how confident Billie is now about being able to “play” her voice like an instrument
i love how when she wrote this song, she wrote it for a character but she also relates to it in her personal life. this song broke my entire heart. it is so sad yet so beautiful. her and finneas always make hits. they truly are one of the best music duos
Billie’s vocal choice was spot on for an emotional piece like this. She’s like a cloud singing for the sun ⛅️
2 words to describe these two and it still undermines their artistic ability: Musical geniuses.
people neglect fin too much. his mindset is so interesting and so much less obscure then a regular mind. He's such a musical genius when it comes to producing and lyric writing
I like how Finneas makes it sounds like a minimal instrumental but there are so many layers into it. Such an amazing production
Now that’s what I call an interview!!! A professional interview!!! We don’t need to know their personal lives, give us more of this!!!
I get frustrated when people say Billie’s music is basic/for teenagers/overrated because they don’t see this side of her and Finneas. They’re one of my most favorite musicians bc of how brilliant they are behind the scenes",24,Entertainment,4180000,PT18M35S

""the room is better with you in it"". one of the greatest compliments ever given.
They are both so articulate in their language it's incredible, I've never seen such an academic yet warm and wholesome interaction from both sides
Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway need their own podcast. I would listen to them all the time
Anne Hathaway REALLY watched Oppenheimer, like observing all the cuts, directions, and dialogues. Love how she knows her game and is a big appreciative of good work, that makes her an amazing actress
Emily is such an honest complimentor you can just tell she means every word and emotion every time she gives Anne compliments about her work and just her personal character in general. She’s such a girl’s girl. They both are. Also this pairing is Variety’s best one yet they very much ate with this.
Anne is INCREDIBLE. So intelligent, in touch, and aware. She is rare
I wholeheartedly agree with Emily complimenting Anne for being so eloquent and articulate throughout the interview. I felt that she's really thought and dissected their work and is not just spouting empty praises for the camera's benefit, her sincerity shines through. Ugh! Love these two!
The conversation was so fluid and genuine... laughs, seriousness, praise, shared experiences, it was like a window into two friends having brunch. Brilliant!
I know this might be more of a conversation than an interview, but damn.. this episode, along with the previous two of Cillian/Margot and Downey/Ruffalo have made me believe that actors on a similar level or playing stage are the best interviewers of each other. So much insight and quality dialogue packed into a very entertaining video.
These Actors on Actors episodes are so good that you can watch it in one go and not get bored once.
this was SUCH an interesting and high level conversation between friends who love each other, and colleagues that absolutely respect each other. they’re both so eloquent, classy and inteligent. ugh just amazing
Anne Hathaway is aging sooooooo beautifully, I can't believe how much time has passed since I first watched The Princess Diaries for the first time. This was such a great conversation, I can't believe the video passed so fast, I could listen to them talk for hours
it's actually sooo nice to see two ladies bond over work that they both admire and worked on together, even fangirling abt/over each other. their energy and love for one another made me smile ear to ear from start to finish. the chemistry, the way they bounce off e/o and finish e/o's sentences is so cute!! the sister/friendship these two have is so beautiful and so pure! <3
Whoever pitched the idea for the last 3 episodes seriously need a raise. What a perfect timing too, nearing holiday season!
This interview was absolutely INCREDIBLE. Hearing them both complimenting not only each other, but nearly everyone they’ve worked with on set, was just wow.
How refreshing to see two people talking to eachother with such dignity, kindness and sincere affection.
Emily was just amazing in Oppenheimer! I completely loved her! Her acting was superb!
Both genuinely seem to be nice, humble and hyper talented women. Never heard anything bad about them in the industry bts. How refreshing and both in the game for so long. 🎉❤
I could listen to Emily and Anne talking for days. Anne's laugh just cleared my skin and brightened my future. Anne is so articulate, is just so beautiful to listen to her speak. Emily is also so eloquent and just watching them being the best friends ever in this was amazing. Im just mesmerized.",24,Entertainment,1260000,PT47M25S

THE MEANING OF LIFE
So bold, Atlus, so bold. Never thought you'd be this direct when marketing this game.
Every trailer just gets me more hyped for this game
""I think I was able to start living because of the time I spent with my friends.""
- Makoto Yuki, _Persona 3: Winter of Rebirth_

Edit: To me, he'll always be Minato Arisato ☝️
Really looking forward to doing Akinari's social link again. His social link was the most meaningful and important social link in the entire game.
😢C'mon, bro, I almost teared up at Junpei's voice line. Zeno really about to make me cry
Every new teaser keeps getting me more and more excited for this game to drop, the animation is just incredible and beautiful I can’t wait 😭‼️‼️
Aleks Le absolutely killed it with that gut-wrenching scream at 1:06, it really does sound like how getting your psyche physically ripped apart would probably feel 😁 rly excited to see his performance as a couple other characters too he's such a talented VA!!!
Is this the opening theme?! Man, the Reload originals just don’t miss! That second half feels straight up like a battle theme!
Bebe sounds way more badass than I expected him to. Loving all the social link voices, so great to finally hear them. Even Kenji seems more likable just from his voice acting.
My life has meaning once again when you remake the game. Thank you Team Atlus!
That amazing song with all those shots of the crew and Akinari talking about the meaning of life actually made me tear up. Well played, Atlus.
Already more than excited to Play Reload and if the song used in this trailer is in it's opening that'll be amazing. Also love the fact Lucien Dodge is Akinari dude's a fantastic voice actor so it great he gets to voice my favorite social link from the original P3.
THE OPENING SONG IS A BANGER MAN
All the social links feel even more alive, Junpei and Akinari’s lines are beautifully done and the armageddon fusion spell at the end… man this 2024 is looking like a great year for gaming
I just realized that every character being voiced means the Sun confidant is included
1:22 made me instantly tear up
I'm so glad every persona soundtrack comes with a game inside.
That one line from Zeno as Junpei has fully cemented that he has what it takes. 

Junpei has this strange gentleness in his voice that I was afraid was going to get lost in the wackiness. But no, he definitely hit a ""home run"".
1:06 and 1:17 really gave me goosebumps. Phenomenal voice acting from Aleks Lee and Zeno Robinson!
Man persona 3 is my favourite, so glad they are making this. I hope with the new graphics people will come to love this game as much as I do",20,Gaming,216000,PT2M1S

Man, your dad is oviously having the time of his life. He is probably the proudest dad this side of the Atlantic. Cherish the time you spend with him. Really touching to see him smile from the bottom of his heart.
Even if the car was fully functional, it wouldn't go into gear if the front latch is unlashed (common issue with the mclaren). If you want to bypass this issue - keep the brake pedal fully depressed and hold the drive (d) selector for 20 sec and it would shift to 1st gear allowing you to move.
Well that was a bit unexpected..., but still need to beat Hammond
No matter how bad a situation is, Mats Dad is ALWAYS laughing. That‘s so inspiring! I like this man sooooo much!
It's upsetting when things don't go to plan for Mat. We're all rooting for you man.
For me as a McLaren technician it is very interesting but kind of a pain to watch you rebuild, or try to rebuild the car. There's so much I would love to tell you how to do different or where you forgot to put in screws or bolted something in the wrong way. Just for example, looks like you forgot the screw of the 'last interior part' from behind? But anyways I will keep watching and just hope you will get it running again! (Try holding down D button when engine is running for around 10 seconds, works wonders sometimes)
Mat it is always entertaining without being stupid like some other YouTubers. You are a hands on problem solver like a lot of us which is refreshing. Looking forward to the journey.
Your explanation of how the suspension works was amazing. This is your best video yet Mat. Cheers!
Looks like the oil drains on the turbos might be kinked or not positioned correctly. You'll smoke like that at idle and free revving since the oil has no where to go and it just goes through the seals. Good luck!
I work for Mclaren as a Technician. If you fill all 8L into the engine in one go during an oil change it will overflow internally and cause a smoke show. Start with 6.5L then run it and go through the top up procedure.
I love how matt's dad has such a positive vibe even in the bad moments
You'll get it worked out Mat! We have faith in you. Keep up the amazing content my man.
I reckon by now, Mat must be the nation's best qualified luxury sports car mechanic. These things are so complex, but he (and his dad and team) always take it in their stride. Inspiring and remarkable.
Way to go Mat and team on getting it this far! Looks like another engine to take out and fix, you got this! 💪
I absolutely enjoy every video you guys do!!!  It feels like I am right along there with you.  I enjoy the great attitude you all have and the ability to have fun no matter what.  Even if it costs money.  LOL
Man you can see the dissappointment on his face he really wants this done. Good luck Man! Absolutely awesome of a series!
Well done mat love watching your videos can’t wait to see the painted results 🎉
I'm sure you will get it sorted, and we will all be here watching when you do 👍

We’ve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it’s lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? 

Well, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. 

Then we have the Lambo. It’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it’s a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg. It also has a much bigger top speed, coming in at 190mph. 

So the Cybertruck has the Urus beat when it comes to performance stats, but will the extra weight drag it down? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!",10243,"What has the world come to, a Lamborghini losing a race to a polygon.
Obviously the Cybertruck has lesser polygons and so it render and thus runs faster.
One could imagine how much it breaks Yanni's heart to see the Urus lose like that.
Cyber truck is a beast but the everyday people won’t be able to afford it.
A refrigerator that goes from 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds….now that’s fast food!

To see something so big moving so fast is just insane.
Gutted I was not there for this
It's often easy to know which car wins even before they race. 98% of the time it's the car Matt is driving 😂
You can imagine how sad Yanni was when he saw the Urus team losing the game like this.
Its easy to predict which car will win in your drag races, Mat - it is always the car you are driving! 😇😃
I noticed in the last video and in this one too that the cybertruck appears to have a slow start in the first 1/8 to 1/4 second to prevent any wheel spin, then the full power is applied once the tires are connected..and from that point it just goes!
I wonder if Matt will ever be allowed to use a Pagani for anything. Even just a review or something would be amazing to see, I think he'd have a great time with something like that
It has great design and amazing new technologies.
Matthew likes the idea of winning. He has to be in a faster vehicle. Even if they swap cars, he has to go back to the faster one.
I wish I could be one of the construction workers there on lunch break watching you guys race. I am sure they are placing bets out there
7:10 Looks like Uris is still rolling at 30mph. The contrast in acceleration is incredible!
Just imagine seeing that big ass boat move that fast in person 😂

Just over one month later, the devastating loss of Ken Block meant that the project was shelved - until now.

Block, The Hoonigans, and Audi continue pushing the limits of what’s possible in the performance EV world with Electrikhana TWO, sliding through iconic areas of Mexico City in Block’s infamously aggressive, rally-inspired driving style. Improving the car immediately after the first film, Block and Audi built on important development lessons from their experience in Las Vegas.

Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.

The series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.

Hailing from Apple Studios, ""Masters of the Air"" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.

#MastersOfTheAir #Trailer #AppleTV",1168,"I wish my Dad was still alive to see this. He was a pilot of a B-24 Liberator in the 93rd Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force, stationed at Hardwick  Airfield in Norfolk, England.
Band of Brothers and The Pacific are both incredible, I expect nothing less for this one too
The level of production in appletv Is amazing looks like a movie
I supervised the cg Environments on this show, and lots of people worked until they were fully drained to make it look this good. Was an honor to pay tribute to those who gave their lives for us to be here today. This is a masterpiece indeed! cheers! , enjoy!
While everyone is waiting for this to air I recommend reading the book which the series is based on, ""Masters of the Air"" by Donald Miller, it is excellent.
Now THAT is a trailer! Band Of Brothers and The Pacific are absolute masterpieces. Two of the best series I have ever, ever seen! I’ve even read the books. Truly cannot wait for this!
I've watched and re-watched Band of Brothers an almost embarrassing number of times.  Bring on Masters of Air!
The predecessor shows before this one by Hanks and Spielberg are second to none. This looks exceptional and will give the authentic look into the courage of the ""Mighty Eighth."" Based on a phenomenal book Masters of the air. I fully expect this to be epic!
So hyped on this. My grandad was a b-17 tail gunner. Flew over on Dday, was shot down twice and survived. Thank you for telling their story.
My grandpa a pilot in the 491st his B-24 was shot down after 23 missions he used the talk of the flak with a quivering voice. 
He was the bravest man I ever knew when I wanted to join the military he asked me not to. It changed me he said, you see things you can't unsee and do things you cannot undo. 
I thank god for all those who served and serve and do those things that cannot be undone and see the things that cannot be unseen so other's don't have to.
Read the book for the second time this summer. It is a masterpiece. While the trailer looks nice and flashy, there is here a sort of veil of romance and bravado that is not felt in the book. The book is blood and guts and 'normal' (If you can can people that crawl into a ball turret normal) people doing incredible things. As others have mentioned, I hope they are not losing the grip on what made The Pacific, Private Ryan and  especially Band of Brothers great; the grounded, uncensored, grim and realistic look, feel and sound. I think I heard something the Hanks even commented that he wanted a grimmer tone for Masters of the Air, more on par with 'Das Boot' for this one- and I am not quite feeling it from this trailer. This feels VERY Hollywood in all aspects.. 'Pretty girl back home', Slow motion explosions, sunsets everywhere...Rest assured- I will still watch it do death- I just hope they do the source material justice in all it's brutality and grit.
Looks really stunning . It feels like a movie , the cinematography looks awesome and the scope is so big . I can't wait to watch this series . Is going to be a big hit 🛩️🛩️🛩️ .
I live nearby a cemetery where hundreds of American and British pilots are buried who died while flying over Holland. Most of these boys were hardly over 20 years old. Every now and then I’ll pay them a visit to show respect for all the men and boys who died fighting the greatest evil of all time. This series looks amazing btw
I teared up watching this trailer, I've been waiting for this to come out ever since it was announced as a thing.

My grandfather served as a bombardier in the 8th Air Force--the very group this is about, although not in the units portrayed as far as I can tell--in the war, and was shot down on his 30th and last mission just days before D-Day. He spent much of the rest of the war imprisoned in Stalug Luft III--escaping twice, staying free the second time--before being liberated by troops under the command of General Patton himself. Seeing something like this brought to the screen, with this much amazing work put into it, is something I've wanted to see in some way for the longest time, having only read his story in his unpublished memoir. He died seven years before I was born after a life that could only be described as epic. 

Now, his story, or what will likely be as close as it'll get to one portrayed onscreen, is finally coming, and from no less than the people who made Band of Brothers and The Pacific. To say I'm stoked is an understatement.
This trailer is very polished looking. I hope they haven't abandoned the gritty realism and harsh tone that in my book is what made Band of Brothers and the Pacific the timeless classics that they are. There is a reason those two series are timeless while WWII films like Unbroken and Red Tails or the recent Greyhound with Tom Hanks on Apple TV aren't - it's the manufactured smaltz factor that the latter have. I think Butler is a fine actor, but I hope he's not over-emoting this entire series like it comes across in the trailer
My father was a WW2 Lancaster pilot in the elite Pathfinder section of RAF bomber command. He would have loved this tribute to his US brothers in arms. RIP Dad.
My late father was a WW2 vet, drafted into the Army at 18 (hadn't even graduated from high school yet). Ended up in Patton's 3rd Army, 90th infantry division during the Battle of the Bulge. Wounded once, walked into the Flosenberg concentration camp at 18 years old ( how could you process that?). I love you dad, you were the best dad a man could ask for!
Looks very gorgeous. The scope is enormous, the cinematography is amazing, and it has the sense of a movie. I'm eager to see this television show. Is going to be very popular .
I adored Band of Brothers, and I have no doubt that Masters of the Air will be equally amazing.
Absolutely loved Band of Brothers and I already know Masters of the Air won’t disappoint 🔥🔥",24,Entertainment,1580000,PT2M25S
GB,UIZAiXYceBI,Hands-on with Gemini: Interacting with multimodal AI,Google,2023-12-06T15:01:17Z,,2306071,56593,"Gemini is our natively multimodal AI model capable of reasoning across text, images, audio, video and code. This video highlights some of our favorite interactions with Gemini. Learn more and try the model: https://deepmind.google/gemini

Im glad to see Google back in the game, this looks next level.
Very impressive. Want to try it.
FYI this is embellished a bit. It's still extremely cool and impressive (and I am SO excited to see these advances!), but there's a fair amount they have to do to get to this exact state. ""In a viral video demonstrating Gemini’s capabilities, Google took significant artistic license. It showed a user speaking with Gemini, but was actually representing a text conversation. It showed a moving video, but was feeding Gemini still images. It showed fast responses, but sped those up. It showed tight model outputs, but shortened them “for brevity.” It showed brief prompts eliciting terrific answers, but listed longer prompts in a blog post."" - from Big Technlology by Alex Kantrowitz
The real-time element is by far the most impressive. These sorts of asynchronous interactions are what AI has been missing thus far.
Just one problem: the video isn’t real. “We created the demo by capturing footage in order to test Gemini’s capabilities on a wide range of challenges. Then we prompted Gemini using still image frames from the footage, and prompting via text.” (Parmy Olsen at Bloomberg was the first to report the discrepancy.)
That is incredibly impressive. There were clearly some hidden prompts as it kept understanding switching contexts. But still it was highly impressive.
I'm just looking forward to when they hook up this kind of AI into one of those Boston Dynamics robots and we can finally have robot servants we can talk to like we always dreamed of in sci-fi! It increasingly feels like we are FINALLY ""living in the future"" like we expected we would by the year 2000!
When this is really working as being shown it is indeed mindblowing. Great job!
Can't wait to try it,with all the understanding this model is able to do it's just amazing.
Very impressive. I didn't expect this kind of thing so early. It just has been a year since AI war started and we come this far.
Unfortunately, what you see is not at all what happened. The AI does not actually reply to the person but to a script and pictures containing sometimes more information than we are shown here
Wow, Gemini is incredibly impressive! The combination of multimodal capabilities and its ability to interact with different formats like text, images, and even code is truly groundbreaking. I especially loved the showcase of visual puzzles and image & text generation. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with AI and open up new possibilities for learning and creative expression
It's truly fascinating to see what AI is now capable of!
This is incredible!! Now if we can combine this with an embodied agent that can navigate through the world, plan out sequences of actions from interactions with the user, and use RL to learn from mistakes and learn about the user, that would be gg!
I can't imagine the amount of data used to train Gemini! this is next level, and if it has Open AI's new voice type, then this will be the greatest multimodal ai
It's kinda crazy how intelligent this AI is on the fly and is considered a basic model by them, the stuff they have behind the scenes is far more advanced.
I find this mindblowing! Although What Im more exited about what is going to happen next, for the past year OpenAi has been without competition so they have probably not been in full gear, now that google and openai have caught on it sure to mean an AI race is going to start with a ridicolous speed of progress
Fascinating 😮 I can’t wait to see what we’ve accomplished in another 5 years

Szoboszlai has perfect balance on the ball.
The way Nunez passed the ball should be the model how the teammates should serve him.
The calmness and finishing skills of Szoboszlai are insane!
Nuñez's work ethic and dedication will always get him a starting place in any team.
The save by Kelleher was very important. It kept the game 0-0 at that time.
The balance and power from szoboslai is insane
First Goal by Captain Virgil always made to look cool by him. Darwin Nunez made a striker's tackle to win the ball and assist for the Second Goal by Dominik Szoboszlai is worth a good mention here. The Blades did not play badly as the game was entertaining enough. Luck, however, always wins the game.
Szobo   bästa man på plan  teknik,defensivt,offensivt,strategisk och målgörare..

Otroligt bra
Congratulations to Sheffield for putting up a great fight and never giving up. They gave LFC a real game today and I think they will be be okay to stay in the PL if they keep up that sort of attitude. Good win for us all the same. On to Palace next. Not gonna be easy either. YNWA
Give the commentator credit,
Think he did a cracking job ,
Better than a lot of today's on sky,
i am a sheffield fan but that nunez press was sick ngl😅🔥 about szobo you know what to expect from him with all that space☠️
Amazing soft touch to cushion the ball , balance and calmness very noticeable. Finish was  superb .I don't know this player but his technique is eyecatching , and pleasing to watch . Liverpool are fortunate to have aquired such a player as Szoboslai .
Van Djik scores as a forward!!❤🎉
Good play by Sheffield! every match in premier league can be unpredictable!
Well played Blades. Liverpool fans have a real soft spot for Chris Wilder, top bloke. Hope you stay up…❤
It ends everything when Van Dijk comes around! ❤ 1:06
Much improved performance and actually made it a game with some desire to play this time but always hard against the quality Liverpool have, missed chances will always cost you, let’s hope performances keeps improving. ⚪️🔴 UTB
Wasn't expecting any points from this game but a fair few players put in their best performance of the season. Brooks coming in did really well. Trusty, McAtee, Souza and Archer improved massively. Need to have more confidence in front of goal and our decision making at key times is still an issue though. UTB ⚔️🔴

This was an unexpected turn for the schedule, but I would genuinely feel bad not screaming out The Black Parade exists.
The absolute best line from the FAQ in the docs for this custom campaign:

""Q: Are you guys fans of My Chemical Romance?
A: No. This is what happens when you think you have a cool name and don’t Google it beforehand.""
I love the thief video series, the game is two decades old but it is one of the most creative and fun retro games you can play.
Damn, this mod looks amazing! It fills my heart knowing there's a dedicated group of old Thief fans like myself making love letters to this legendary trilogy. The scale of the maps is unreal and I wanna get lost in them snagging loot. Can't wait to play this!
You know smth is gonna be good when Mandalore resurrects the Mod Spotlight series to talk about it.

Seriously though would love to see you cover more mods on games.
This man will do absolutely anything to avoid making the Thief 4 video.
I was given the honor of betatesting this absolute behemoth, and all I can say to my fellow Thief fans is: go play it if you want to experience Thief as if it was the first time
11:23 What are you so frightened of? Come to me...
It was seriously a privilege to have gotten to do voicework and later betatest this beast. I will forever be in awe of the dedication and craft of the team. Hope you enjoyed my contribution, and may The City never die!
I can only imagine how proud someone must be who, as a creator, made a game with the technology they had available at the time. And then 25 years later, the fans of that which you have created have been compelled enough to carry forward and expand upon your work with this scale.
Blessed be the mod makers. I salute you all for your community service. If only you could create as much as you wish. Hopefully the artists wont starve some day.
Every time Thief content reaches broad audience it feels like something to celebrate
How crazy is this. The mod solidifies lore from multiple games. I would love for all companies to take so much care of their IPs. Make them deeper, fix problems etc. This mod should be a template for all sequels. 

I think gaming lost a LOT when the concept of expansions died. The same engine, more missions, more lore, just more. This mod is clear proof how much value this concept can add without pushing the games technology too much further.
Once again, Mandy proves to be the saviour of the broken, defeated and the damned. And also signal-boosting one of the coolest things to come out of the modding scene this year.

I should really get into this after Arcane Dimensions. And also Wizordum.
It was a privilege to be able to contribute to this, it's truly a landmark in the Thief community and all the new developments on display are going to be a real game changer- the same way Thief 2X was all the way back in 2005.
Daily reminder that everyone should check out The Dark Mod. It's an standalone total conversion of Doom 3 that's Thief but legally distinct, and it has an active community of Thief veterans that make missions throughout the year. For a free fan game, it's an impressive testament of how passionate the Thief modding community is even when the franchise is dead.
I always love to see Thief Fan Missions represented, there are a ton of extremely high quality levels, I'm like 3 levels into this one and it's fantastic, always love to see Lady Rowena represented after her passing, she was a sublime map maker

#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",776,"This is a certified “I Tried 100% Speedrunning Cuphead” moment.
To think that the Devs had to sell their own house at one point to finish the game.
The game flopping would have been terrifying.
This man has professionalism in 70% of the entirety of video games.
37:10 It's surprising how few people know that the parry hitboxes for King Dice's cards are extended upward if you are playing as Chalice. However, the fight against Hopus Pocus (the rabbit) is almost impossible to complete without taking damage, so Cuphead is still optimal for this level.
The fact that he called Cagney flowey without acknowledging it is too funny
""Here she turns into a sausage and tries to attack us with her swirling meat attacks  while we also have to deal with a bunch of dangling meats""💀💀💀
How did you get past the first level so fast? I saw a professional video game journalist spend 25 minutes on it because of its difficulty.
While I have 300% the game, I'm definitely not mad enough to try speed running it yet. Respect.
There are several reasons I'm terrible at Cuphead, but one of them is that I get distracted wanting to watch the brilliant animations
If you play the circus run and gun level, you van dodge roll through the stack of minions if u stand on the top platform. Just roll, jump and dash to the next platform. That you you dont have to shoot them and safe time! 
It also works on the cannons at the end at that section.
this game is just amazing for many reasons and i would love to see it more on this channel
The divine relic is actually perfect for the devil. On his second phase, you can spam your whetstone to deal a ton of damage and kill him insanely quickly
Cuphead is so unique in like every aspect I love it
Even though I have S ranked every boss in the game, I will definitely not speedrun the game like you, mad respect there were even things I didn't know you showed in your speedrun like Mortimer freeze's final phase has no hitbox damn.
I never knew that not attacking the onion was a viable option
for those who don't know: if u leave the dogs alive but damage their jetpacks (when the jetpacks spray gray smoke instead of white smoke) then the fight becomes slightly easier because the robot dog won't flip the screen upside down
I'm so sad that speed runs take so long to do because I could watch your videos every day all the time 😊 they're so good
This is the most beautiful game ever made and I don't see it getting beaten any time soon. I'll take a unique and amazingly creative artstyle like this over photorealistic graphics any day.
This is easily top 3 favourite games of all time such a unique game and every level is a boss apart from run n guns absolutely love it
For ribby & croaks you can use converge because it pierces through hitboxes so you can do double damage to them",20,Gaming,2750000,PT38M41S

The person who paired them up deserves a raise
It's so rare to see Cillian Murphy enjoying an interview and I am all in for it.
Apparently, it was Cillian's team that reached out to Variety asking for the pairing, and I find that super wholesome.
""Audiences don't like being told 'you should see this or you should see that'. They will decide and they will generate the interest themselves."" - such a brilliant quote
Cillian doesn't look like he hates life in this. How delightful it is to see him smile and laugh through the conversation. He initiated this pairing and wanted to be there, please give him more chances to make his own choices. The result is seeing him truly happy to engage with someone.
Can we take a moment to appreciate that the producers even matched the microphones to the outfits? 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
It feels so good to see a full-length-conversational-interview being given by Cilian. Could totally relate with Margot when she started talking and asking questions about Peaky Blinders 😅
I love how he just ask her questions, and keeps her talking. As a fellow introvert, what a classic move
Y'all the way I was DEVOURING every single bit of Cillian's talking. Only the fans know how precious is having him speaking so lightly and for such a long time. That man never shows up anywhere, he doesn't have social media, it's a suffering to love him
Margot is a masterclass on how to combine beauty and brains, her insights on being a producer are so interesting as she was involved in the entire process from day one.
I love how Margot doesn‘t let Cillian get away with his modest attitude and really grills him in a charming way on subjects like his apparent unawareness of the memes and the reasons why Nolan loves to work with him.

You can really sense that she‘s 100% authentic and doesn‘t shy away from confidently stating that she knew that the movie was going to be a hit and that her performance was influential in convincing Matell.
It brought so much joy to watch these two discovering each other’s role. So natural and calm energy. And it’s so amazing to see them being engaged to their characters
I just love how natural cillian is… no vanity, nothing fake, no facade… just him, pure and simple. It’s really calming listening to him
I love 23:41 where Margot is talking about their morning dance parties and how fun it is a Cillian is just like “ahhh..” bc he was in an artistic black hole doing this dark movie (I’ve seen other actors from Oppenheimer saying that they were having the best time and Murphy had to be focused and couldn’t/didn’t join in bc he was depriving himself of sleep and so zoned in and focused) but his reaction to her saying how much fun it was made me laugh 😂😂
the fact that Margot is Cillian’s biggest fan makes this even better 😂 loved this pairing and this convo
The reference about the PHD woman who can't introspect is PURE GENIUS from Greta. Impressive association to make with a Barbie character. Wow
The Barbenheimer phenomenon was so crazy. Usually when two big movies come out simultaneously, one suffers greatly. But in this case, both movie actually helped the other movie succeed evm more.
Hands down the best Actors on Actors interview. Ever. Cillian and Margot are such gems in themselves, so coming together for this thoughtful back and forth was so special. My first time actually getting through an entire AoA episode!! <3
Cillian and Margot's dynamic is one where you would think it would be something so odd because of how almost paradoxal it is, but this interview with them paired together honestly couldn't have worked out better. Both of them are so humble and grounded in their respective crafts, and it was so easy to just sit and admire them for who they are",24,Entertainment,1260000,PT48M28S

How the Nintendo Zapper worked in Slow Motion - The Slow Mo Guys",2262,"I really want to see the laser scanner at a grocery store checkout.  It seems to have mirrors moving very fast
I assume it flashes the boxes in two different frames so it can know which one you hit, otherwise it wouldn't be able to tell which of the boxes you're aiming at.
I'd love to see an inkjet printer in slow-motion! I think the ink droplets falling on paper would be interesting
I love these quieter informative videos you do Gav, I’m glad you’ve kept them going after the lockdowns, they’re fascinating
This continues to be magic. How they figured out they could do this is unfathomable.
So creative… I love how when a technology is less developed, creators are forced to use ingenuity and you get so many interesting things instead of twelve versions of the same thing
This game was a gem of my childhood. Once you discover the second controller can control the ducks it's a whole new game.
As a 37 year old now, I was always curious how this worked and I also noticed the whole screen flashing on the menu! Really cool video
This is genuinely ahead of its time. So much thinking and programming went even to make sure you won't cheat by pointing it at a white bulb, not to mention nobody back then had slowmo cameras to even figure this out. Do more such smaller but super intriguing videos man!
Would really love to see the droplets from an inkjet printer !!
that bit of filming the CRT at super slo-mo alone is worth this video, incredible stuff.
This stuff is so amazing!! I live seeing how things from my childhood worked! Thank you
The reason it shows two white boxes on separate frames is so that it can tell which duck you shot at, because whether it sees the first or second frame determines which duck it was
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING - I was total Duck Hunt maniac back in 80´s and also obsessed about how things work - thank you so much for this slo-mo retrospective! 🤟🤟🤟
If you had a second CRT on a channel that wasn't broadcasting (static / snow) and shot at it, it was always a hit.
This truly is brilliant. I never would have guessed that’s how it worked.
This is so fascinating that I want to tell this to my grandkids how ""real engineering"" was done back in the days, but I am afraid i am gonna forget it by then. Any tips to remember such a cool thing?
I really like these “how it works” style of video. There is so much technology that we take for granted that do amazing things in the blink of an eye
One thing people (my friends at least) didn’t notice in Duck Hunt was that while in two player mode, you could control the duck’s movement with the controller while the other player was playing. My friends would get frustrated that there ducks would move a lot more then mine would and I’d tell them they’re imagining it.
So that's how it works! I always wondered about that. Thanks for sharing this with us!",24,Entertainment,14900000,PT5M24S
